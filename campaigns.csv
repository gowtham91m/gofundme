He's always been ready with a helping hand, whether it was introducing us to the wild world of Amazon, teaching us something new, or just being a great friend when we needed it. It's hard to think of someone who is more willing to jump in and be there to do the right thing.It’s our turn to help Ryan and his family however we can. As some of you may already know, Ryan had to have surgery to remove an infection that was next to his spine. Unfortunately the surgery ended with complications and Ryan came out of surgery paralyzed from the chest down. He will be in a rehab hospital for several months. The Leslie family home will need to be remodeled to accommodate a wheelchair and they will also need to purchase a different vehicle. It’s unknown what insurance will cover and what type of long term care will be needed.Any donation will go directly to Ryan and his family to help cover medical and home care expenses.",326,869,3,328,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

As a result Bill was paralyzed from the neck down and has lived the last 48 years of his life as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. Bill took on his disability the same way he played sports, with courage and determination, and has lived these years independently, graduating from, working for, and retiring from UC Berkeley, initially as an early medical retirement, and now, full retirement.However, upon his full retirement in June Bill lost a major source of income, UC sponsored Long Term Disability payments at $900.00 per month. Bill used these funds to help pay for his daily attendant care needs required for a quadriplegic to live independently. The loss of these funds threatens Bill’s ability to live independently in his home. In addition, concurrently with this loss of income, both his needs for, and the cost of, attendant care are rising. Bill anticipated this loss of income a year before it happened and diligently cut back on his expenses at home and researched other ways to replace the income in order to pay for attendant care, through social services and public benefits, but to no avail, as the options were either disqualifying or share of cost prohibitive.As well, recent serious illness, surgery, and hospitalizations have left Bill recovering in bed since January, and the need for attendant care increasing even further than anticipated and his newly reduced income will now barely cover the cost of basic attendant care, if that. In addition to Bill’s normal daily routine of an attendant getting him out of and into his bed into and out of his wheelchair daily, and helping with his morning and evening hygiene and medication regimes, attendant care is needed when he is bedbound to bring him meals, turn him in his bed to prevent pressure sores, help with the same daily hygienic and medication regimes but now including assistance with respiratory therapies and wound care.Bill’s need for financial assistance is immediate and will be ongoing for attendant care and possibly other needs such as adaptive equipment for everyday living that could help mitigate some of the attendant care needs by keeping Bill healthier, back in his wheelchair, able to do more for himself without help, and out of the hospital.Throughout Bill’s life he always thought of others before himself in his school, family, and work lives, whether through his kindness, his volunteer work, or his patient listening to our stories and complaints, and now it is our turn to think of and support Bill.",230,189,2,293,1 month,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are reaching out to our friends, family, well-wishers and looking at crowd funding options to raise money to help with the treatment costsHow it beganIt all started in 2009, when training for a half a marathon, Smitha noticed a sudden onset of fatigue. She went from running 5mi comfortably to needing breaks every half a mile.She also noticed that her flip flops would keep coming off her feet while she was walking.Within a week, she felt an odd tingling sensation in her fingers that spread to her arms.  Followed by cold wet droplets on her face and neck.As these symptoms worsened, she knew something was seriously wrongIn Sept2009, at age of 24, Smitha was diagnosed with MSWhat is MS?MS is an auto-immune disease that affects the central nervous system.Our nerves have a protective sheathing called Myelin. This ensures that electrical impulses can travel through the length of the nervous system. In MS, the patient’s immune system marks this myelin as a threat and starts to attack them. As the myelin gets depleted, the brain can no longer communicate with the rest of the body effectively.The loss of Myelin shows up as black / white scar marks in MRI. MS attacks in waves. And, each attack results in further myelin loss. This directly translates to increased physical disability in the patient.When Smitha was diagnosed with MS, she was still a student. Her Student Health insurance did not cover the treatment costs. She could not afford to pay for her medication, out of pocket.In just 4 months after her diagnosis, hit by a giant relapse. The severity of attack alarming and it affected her quality of life permanently After coming to terms with these new physical limitations, we decided to make the best of what life had to offer. We traveled when we could, added a dog to our family, fostered a few dogs, charted our future, and eventually started thinking about starting our own family. In Jan2016, we were blessed with not just one, but a set of Twin boys!In the 9 years since her diagnosis, Smitha’s condition has constantly been worsening due to multiple relapses. Each relapse has required her to change to the next strongest FDA approved meds in market and none of them have been effective. After another attack in May 2018, we found out that our options for more drugs were quickly running out.We are now at to a point where we need to make some hard choices. If left untreated, the next MS attack could happen any moment. And that can lead to vision loss, memory issues, complete loss of bladder control and even needing a wheelchair permanently.Our kids are only 2.5 years old. And, in these 2.5 years, Smitha has been forced to watch the kids growfrom the sidelines.She was NOT there when the kids took their first steps.She was NOT there when the boys entered the swimming pool for the first time.She has NOT been able to walk with them to the neighborhood parkAnd, she knows, she won’t be able to help them ride a bike,or , play ball with them in the evenings,Or, come running to their aid, when they need her help.After her recent relapse, she has been feeling so exhausted, that she cannot even pick up her kids or even talk coherently when tired.All of this can change though. And the answer is in an extremely promising clinical trial called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, or HSCT.HSCT is the first and only medical procedure that can not only stop MS, but also reverse the symptoms of MS, by re-growing the lost myelin. The idea here is to wipe out the faulty immune system in the body with Chemotherapy, then reintroduce the patient’s stem cells and build a new immune system from scratch. This hard reboot of the immune system is a rigorous procedure that takes about a month and a half to complete. It is a risky procedure and is only administered to patients that have an aggressive case of MS and who have not responded well to other FDA approved medications. Among such patients, the results from past trials have been very promising. In upto 87% of the cases, this reprogrammed immune system does not attack the myelin again and thereby stops further progression of the disease. It has also shown to significantly reduce the patient’s disability and patients show continued recovery even after 4 years post treatment.But, the best of the insurance programs do not cover this procedure, as it is not FDA approved yet, which has put the entire burden of raising the money for this procedure on us.The last time the insurance did not cover her treatment MS dealt a swift and devastating blow. We are fully committed to defeating MS this time around.And with your help, we will be a step closer to achieving that goal.We don’t have much to offer you other than our gratitude. All we can say, is thanks for supporting us in our fight. There are a few ways in which you can choose to donate and help us out. You can read about this in the More Info section.You can also help by sharing this link on social media. Tag your friends you think might help. Also share this with friends and family who might be suffering from diseases like Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, progressive scleroderma or other forms of autoimmune disease. The same treatment mentioned above can help turn around their lives too.If we do manage to go beyond our goals, we will donate all the excess money to the next patient who is eligible for this trial and for whom the insurance does not cover this life changing procedure.",600,1.2k,0,584,10 days,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,11,Help Patrick Fight Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/hud44-help-patrick-fight-cancer,"PHILADELPHIA, PA","March 29, 2018","$75,000","$67,895","Hello, my name is Crystal Nardone, and my husband, Patrick Connors, is a painter, art scholar, and an art teacher. He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate. Thank you.",565,1.6k,14,565,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are the fortunate friends of Jane Schiowitz and we are ready to move mountains for our fierce pal as she fights brain cancer, but we need your help.Jane is a mom, a wife, a daughter, and a sister, but to us she is our creative, fun-loving, loyal friend whose infectious laugh fills any room. (Jane & her husband Rick Brooks)She is a gifted artist by trade and an amazing Mom to her teenage son.(Jane & her son Julian)
In early March 2018, Jane started having strange symptoms: facial spasms, numbness, and weakness on her left side.  An MRI revealed a tumor on the right side of her brain.  Living close to New York City, Jane was able to get exceptional medical care. Surgery on March 14 resulted in the removal of 95 percent of the tumor. While her surgery was successful, the type of cancer she has — glioblastoma — is aggressive and may come back. Within the next month, Jane will undergo intensive treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy and a clinical trial at Sloane-Kettering. This next phase of treatment is arduous and costly.



After digesting this news, we decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf. Jane has not been able to work since her diagnosis and will not be able to work throughout the course of her treatment, which will also create a significant financial hardship for her family. She will and has already incurred significant expenses due to her recent neurosurgery, hospital stay and rehabilitation. These medical expenses are adding up quickly and will be prohibitive.Jane’s wonderful spirit has touched so many people. We hope that we 


can raise $75,000 to help defray her medical costs and ease her family’s financial burden which will allow her to focus on beating cancer.You can keep up with her latest progress and share your well wishes on her Facebook page.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking an interest in this very dear cause.   (Jane and her sister Nan)

The pregnancy was going well until complications started to emerge. Then the beginnings of a heart-breaking nightmare began to unfold. Little Aaron was born prematurely on Wednesday, August 1st and was delivered by emergency C-section. His health took a sharp downturn when he suddenly stopped breathing. Aaron was taken to the ICU where it was discovered he had an infection. Worse, Claire also came down with an infection that required immediate surgery. It was so aggressive, that Claire had four separate surgeries to remove all of it (it had invaded a large amount of tissue including several organs). The doctors worked frantically to eradicate the infection, but sadly, didn't expect her to live.  By a miracle, Claire has beat the odds, but she is still in critical condition. As with any medical treatment, the cost (so far) of treating her and her newborn son has been astronomical. Zack has been with his wife the entire time so their income has stopped. The continued treatment and recovery will take months and will certainly be financially devastating. It is hard to determine how much all the bills will add up to, but Zack and Claire are in urgent need of financial assistance to help them cover all the costs and stay on their feet. In the meantime, prayers are requested and much appreciated.

Medical,12,Detective Atkinson Needs Assistance,https://www.gofundme.com/detective-atkinson-needs-assistance,"WEST ISLIP, NY","April 29, 2018","$50,000","$63,978","Detective Jamie Atkinson is a highly decorated, 36 year old officer who has been employed with the New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department for the past 15 years.  On his days off, he serves on the Board of Directors for his local volunteer EMS organization and works as a Safety Officer at Northwell Health.  Jamie has always answered calls for assistance with a selfless enthusiasm, whether it was responding to ground zero as a volunteer EMT after the September 11th Terrorist Attack to provide countless hours of search and recovery operations, responding to and investigating crime scenes or organizing a local charity event.  However on Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Detective Jamie Atkinson answered the call that would change his life forever.  When he answered the phone, Jamie immediately knew that this call was different than the thousands of calls that he had answered in the past.  This call was from his doctor who, after advising Jamie to acquire a CT scan of his abdomen after examining him for chronic pain and swelling, called to inform him that he needed to immediately respond to a specialist for further testing.  The CT scan the doctor explained, had revealed what appeared to be multiple masses in his abdomen.  Further testing would later reveal the diagnoses of a rare condition known as Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP).  PMP occurs when a cancerous tumor in the appendix creates a high grade cancerous Mucin (cells that create a cancerous mucus) that eventually ruptures through the appendix wall causing the Mucin to fill the abdominal cavity, where it continually produces cancerous mucus.  This cancerous mucus then spreads to other organs where it creates new tumors.  It is estimated that this condition occurs in only 1 per 1,000,000 persons a year.  Doctors believe that Jamie’s exposure to the many airborne carcinogens during his countless hours volunteering at ground zero in the aftermath of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks has contributed to this cancer.At this time, Jamie is currently undergoing bi-weekly chemotherapy treatments in order to shrink the cancerous tumors in his abdomen prior to his upcoming scheduled surgery.  This invasive surgery, which could take up to 15 hours to complete, consists of the removal of several organs and the placement of “heated” chemotherapy directly into the abdomen during surgery in an attempt to destroy any remaining microscopic cancer cells.  The recovery from this surgery, which is referred to as the mother of all surgeries, could leave Jamie in the Intensive Care Unit for upwards of a month.  The surgery and recovery process will not only cause an incredible emotional burden on Jamie’s family, but it will also cause a steep financial burden on them as well.  Not only will the family have to take off numerous days from work to support Jamie throughout the surgery and month long recovery process, but the family will also have to travel or stay overnight near the hospital, which is located in New York City.Jamie has always answered the call for anyone who was in need of assistance.  Now it is our time to answer his call and to provide the family with as much support as possible.  Please know that this fund is being handled by fellow MTA Police Lieutenant Chris Nutter, who has worked with Jamie for the past 15 years.  Lt. Nutter in no way intends to benefit financially from this fund and 100% of the donations raised will go directly to the Atkinson Family to assist with any financial expenses incurred during the surgery and recovery process.  Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.",619,1.7k,8,624,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Jen was in the 31st week of her first pregnancy and thought of nothing but the baby’s health. Within two days, doctors located two embolisms-one in Jen’s heart and one in her lung, as well as a “mass” in her heart. The “mass” turned out to be angio-sarcoma, a very rare form of cancer.On Friday, April, 6, 2018, Jen underwent her first chemotherapy treatment. She will continue to have weekly treatments of chemotherapy until doctors are able to deliver her baby at 37 weeks. Her treatments will resume two weeks after the baby is born. There are simply no words that can adequately describe the fear and the heartache Jen and her husband Matt have endured these past two weeks.Jen and Matt were made for each other. They met while volunteering for Youth Group, a program designed to provide academic opportunities for children in need. Through their shared love of history (they are both teachers), travel, education, and volunteerism, they fell in love and married in 2008. I met Jen when she started teaching at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Currently, Jen teaches Advanced Placement U. S. History and Psychology, a demanding schedule for any veteran teacher, but Jen’s dedication and hard work quickly made her one of the most respected members of the faculty.Jen is the type of teacher who spends countless hours before and after school helping students, some of whom are not even in her classes, with their schoolwork. She is constantly organizing fieldtrips, advising clubs, and volunteering her time to those in need. Every year Jen lets her hair grow, only to cut and donate it to The Jimmy Fund’s program that provides wigs for cancer patients. Just last year, Jen was voted the “Most Inspirational Teacher” and was also awarded “Teacher of the Year.” As a person, Jen is the most selfless person I know. She’s never too busy to sit down with a colleague. Take today for instance, while in intensive care Jen sent out a group text to our department reminding us of a colleague’s birthday, even apologizing for not being able to make his favorite dessert. There has never been a birthday or special occasion Jen has not remembered and celebrated.When Jen and Matt found out they were expecting a baby, it was a dream come true for them. Their excitement was infectious, both had dreamt of being parents. But since March 31th, their life will never be the same. Jen and Matt are both teachers and the medical bills are starting to pile up. Matt works in Providence, RI and has been making the daily trip from Providence to Boston to be with his best friend. Unfortunately, there is a long road ahead.With all the anxiety and fear they are experiencing, the financial burden is one that we are hoping to alleviate. Please consider donating to help Jen and Matt on their long journey but most of all, please pray for them. Thank you and please share this message, as I know Jen would be doing everything in her power to help anyone else in this situation.Sincerely,Mindy Morin",954,1.7k,12,956,4 months,19 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

As you know my favorite things to share are my kids and people helping people. My goal in to show you how awesome my family is or to make you smile. There is so much negativity in the world i like to share the good things. I don’t share much personal stuff on here so this next post is going to be quite hard for me. There is a part of my story that I have kept silent for some time now. Every time I open up about it I seem to gain a new understanding or some knowledge that may help me. I am not ashamed, I was just hoping to tell this story from the other side but it’s taking a little longer than I hoped. If you’ve been wondering why i haven’t been around or as involved as much as usual, here’s why! So….Feb. 23rd 2017, I got a phone call telling me that I had metastatic melanoma. Yes, a phone call! I had a swollen lymph node on my right side, went to a surgeon and had it removed. Feb. 23rd they called and told me what it was. If you want to hear about how horribly they delivered the news I can tell you in person. But, lets not dwell on the lame parts of this story!. So, here’s the deal. I got some scans immediately and nothing else showed up. I was elated!!! The doctors at SCCA at Evergreen put me on immunotherapy as a “insurance” plan. It’s called adjuvent therapy. Well, this therapy made me super sick last summer. I was sick from the 5th of July until about the 15th. (103 degree temp etc…). They took me off this therapy and gave me a high dose of prednisone. That is the worst good drug out there. If you’ve ever had it, you know what i am talking about. It makes you feel like you drank 16 cups of coffee and you are severely agitated. (sorry Jessie)Sept. 2017 we did a scan and found 6 new locations of potential disease. Two of which are on my liver (no bueno). I started a new immunotherapy called pembrolizimab (same as Keytruda ads on TV) and this had a mixed response but was not working as well as we hoped so, they placed me on a “clinical trial”. I tried that for a while, it sucked; bad side effects and had to get shots in my stomach daily for a while. The side effects have been rough. I had some serious migraines (which I never suffered from before), hearing loss, ringing in my ears, cluster headaches with stroke like symptoms etc… (Thank you Mercer Island Fire Dept., I hoped I would never have to call you but you were great). Needless to say some of the side effects have sucked! Good news, almost all of them have reversed!!! Yeah! I did some scans after being in the trial for a while and they found that I had 26% tumor progression. They allow up to 20% but 26% was too high so they took me off of the trial. The good news is my tumors were really small so 26% progression means they are still small. This brings us to now. I recently got in touch with some friends who encouraged me to go to CA to get some opinions. I have seen doctors at UCLA and MD Anderson in Texas. I have been to Texas two times in the last two weeks and have had a couple of tumors removed in the event we try T-cell therapy in the future. Right now I am eagerly awaiting to find out what my next treatment plan will be. I had surgery last week and am still recovering. It has been very painful but getting better slowly. The good news is that although my diagnosis is ""stage 4 metastatic melanoma"" there are a number of different treatment options still available to me. (the stages are based off of the last 10 years of survival rates. The medications today were not even available 2 years ago) I am an optimist to a fault as you all know. This has been a hard battle and will continue to be hard but I WILL WIN! I repeat, I WILL WIN!. I would love any and all support you can spare. I am a helper and i am terrible at asking for help when i need it. I want to give a big shout out to my wife Jessie and my Family. There is no way i could do this without them. Jessie has taken care of all the paperwork (there is TONS) so i can just focus on being healthy and not thinking about it until i need to. Jessie is a rockstar and i am thankful for her daily. My parents and in laws have helped us with airfare and hotel stays while traveling to all these appointments. I didn't think having an illness could require so much travel and travel is expensive, especially when it's last minute. Not worrying about the financial burden of these trips has been amazing. Thank you to everyone that already knows and has been helping silently. There are many of you that have provided prayer, hugs, dinners etc. This is the first time in my life i have been dealt something i can't ""handle"" on my own. I have learned a lot over this past year and continue to learn daily. first and foremost i have learned i need to lean on other people when i need them. Don’t be offended if I didn’t tell you about this. I shared this with few people hoping it would be a quick battle and i could tell my story when it was over. What can you do/How can you help:-I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP, IM TERRIBLE AT ASKING FOR HELP!-DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF MY KIDS!(they know but let me handle any discussions about it)-DON’T TREAT ME LIKE IM SICK(if you do, i may punch you in the throat and ask how you are This is a part of my story now, what it means to be Kirk Robinson, K-Rob, Kirky, Nino, hollywood, surfer boy or whatever you may call me. I wouldn't have picked this part of the story line, that's for sure. No sense being upset at the cards your dealt, just play them the best you can! I have met several people along this journey that i wouldn't have met otherwise. I am thankful for their support and their encouragement to share my story! Jim Brown, Ann Jarris Adam Throop, Melinda McKinley-throop, Rob Sweet and my ""text prayer group"". One group of people Monster and Sea heard my story through a friend and i found a card in my mailbox with some money to help us out. Timing could not have been better! I was so choked up that a group of people would want to help like this. It meant more than you can imagine!Please keep me and my family in your prayers! I know God has control over this. I pray daily that my eyes are open to the things around me and that i will be healed. I am a Blessed man, I am so lucky to have the family and friends that i do. I am thankful daily!HERES TO KICKING CANCERS ASS!!!!!

Medical,12,Help for special needs kid/moving,https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid,"MACON, GA","May 25, 2018","$75,000","$63,210","https://youtu.be/_Owd9bx-RCUHello, thank you for taking time to read my campaign for our son, David. Like any family, when our son hurts, we hurt. When my husband wakes up our son for school in the mornings it tears my soul apart when he tells me when I get home from work that David has vomited in his sleep because he had a seizure. The thought that he could have died right there in his bed is the worst possible nightmare that We could ever have and the fear of it becoming reality set us in motion to save our son. A kind service dog has eased, but not erased the worry and dread by standing guard of him and being able to detect and alert to the oncoming seizures so  that my husband can now half way sleep knowing that he will hear her cries for help when David’s voice is gone.The Doctors tried him on many medications (some all at once) to try and stop the seizures as he was having them daily. These medications almost cost him his life just because of their chemical nature. We trusted these Doctors that their medical expertise with these medications were in David’s best interest, past my own knowledge, my husband researched them and wow the side effects, and then watched these dangerous chemicals that are prescribed in good faith have a different chemical reaction in our son that could not have been foreseen, the seizures got worse, our son has fought many times for his life with Doctors fighting to bring him back and keep him here. David has a service dog, seizures, seizure medications, and Doctors. What he doesn’t have is the ability to be a child because the seizures have stolen his childhood from him. He cannot even ride his bike to the park with friends. What would happen if he had a seizure crossing the street? He cannot go to school and enjoy when he is so tired and recovering from days of seizures to the point he was going to have to be isolated even more and taught at home. David cannot just go be a kid with his friends because “What if this is THE seizure that We have been tearing our hearts and brains  apart to stop, and prayerfully begging that never comes. Neither of us can protect him in his own bed, let alone away from home. His dog helps detect and alert, but she would not be able to render the medical care that he would need. We would have to just trust that some stranger would recognize it, and call for help. Also hope that someone driving the street where he fell did not look down at the radio, or to another distraction for a split second and hit David or Malory. Can any father or mother  in good faith trust their child’s life to the hands of potential strangers? If a parent did, would they have their child’s best interest? Are we really doing the right thing by imprisoning him for any reason and watching his childhood pass him by? How do We keep from hating ourselves because we are supposed to be able to fix this and protect him? What can We do? Nobody can save our son, and neither of us are willing to accept letting him go, or his innocence of catching lightening bugs and bringing me a wilted flower that he had in his pocket for an hour or the dead bug to his dad that he accidentally sat on die in our faces. His eyes search us for help, and we have none.In February 2018, after my husband did some researching and wrestling with the idea, asking myself about the law, the thought of giving something illegal to our child that was for our entire childhood “a bad and dangerous drug,” we started treating him with Marijuana. Unfortunately it is still illegal here in Georgia. We had plans and hopes of getting him on a good track with school, and referred out of state to better and broader medical practices. We both demanded to know what is going into our child, and while we did everything we could to know, neither of us had any legal access to a Doctor’s experience with different kinds. We knew the risks that we read, the medical research that We both had to pour over for hours fighting what is right/legal/safe/moral, I informed all of his medical team because we wanted our son to be safe. I was not advised to stop treating him this way along with safer medications from the Doctor. The Doctor did not comment exactly why, but I think she wanted to see for herself. The combination granted our son 71 days seizure FREE!!!!! For 71 days our son rode his bike, woke up, went to school, played with friends, played outside, and the terror for his life that gripped our hearts and souls began to lift. The smiles on our faces reflecting our child getting to be a normal child. Safe in his bed. Doing better in school. Having a great quality of life. We were breaking the law. We saved our son. We were fixing the fragments the best way we could of him being that little boy that was taken away from him by these seizures. This is our job as parents, to protect our child even with our own lives. As I wrote above, I kept his medical team up to date. As we felt we had found his miracle, and anyone else who saw his medical history would see this too. We also felt like his entire medical team truly cared for him and wanted the same things we did, and with honesty on my part and his safety forefront of every visit, we were winning. This transparency also meant informing a new therapist who did not share our joys or beliefs that allowing him access to marijuana was worth this new life he had begun. I was reported to DCFS, and on April 19, 2018 their representatives along with deputy sheriff’s entered our home with our cooperation and full truth of what and why, and despite the evidence, demanded that I stop “abusing” our son by giving him this “dangerous” marijuana. Allowing him to have debilitating seizures that threaten his life and any quality of that life was quite okay as long as he was not using marijuana. They did not even apply his medical team’s observations and findings to their opinions. If you are unsure what is worse, look up seizure medication side effects. Then look up medical research for marijuana usage as seizure treatment. Compare the two with success rates, side effects, birth defects that are known, long term effects that are known, what class of drug they are in by abuscability, pretend David is your child, and tell us honestly that following the law, but risking his life is better than trying something that is illegal, but with mountains of medical data as to it’s worth as a treatment to the point on becoming legal in certain states. We stood behind our decision to save our son’s life even though we had not made the move yet, and openly admitted to allowing him to use it for the treatment of his seizures. We have never lied about where he got it, or our intentions. The DCFS demanded that we cease this immediately. Against our better judgement, we did. They were not there for the times my husband had to drag our son to the truck because it takes 45 minutes for help to arrive. They were not there for the times that we carried him out of the house to break the traffic laws to get him the help he so desperately needed. They were not there to see my husband loose several jobs because we were rushing our son to get medical help. They were not there when we spent almost 3 months in an emergency room everyday because our son was being transported because he’d done had another seizure either at home or at school, or that 2 weeks out of those 3 months was spent at a hospital in Atlanta begging the doctors to take him off the medication that was killing him. There was no way we could afford to get him to a state that could help him fast enough to stop what we both knew was coming and even told the DCFS representative and officer. Even working two jobs as I do and the 4 that my husband does. There was a small hope that once they could see his seizures returning, and his Doctor’s recommendations that they would see we were not any of those other types of the parents that they see so often it hardens their hearts to only seeing laws and what the state deems acceptable parenting. Maybe they would allow me just enough time to get him to the help of a medical center in an appropriate state. Within14 hours of the marijuana being stopped without consulting his Doctor, even with the safer seizure medications still administered, his service dog was alerting my husband as I was filling out paperwork for the DCFS office, David’s eyes filled with dread, fear, and hopelessness as all Matthew could do was watch it happen and get him to the hospital, and before my heart could even beat, he was in the grips of this horrible, evil, monster that threatens his life again. We felt sure they would see now. We felt sure they would not be able to ignore the obvious and blatant evidence in front of their faces, and the loss of childhood in our son’s face. This was not correct. While our son fought for his life, officially in DCFS custody and flatlining 15 times according to medical records, my husband was arrested, they tore me from my baby’s side and told me they were going to take custody of him as I was arrested too. They say he is not safe with us while a medical team tries to start his heart again because they have stopped his treatment by what they know of the law and their opinion. Then by opinion of the hospital’s police staff, my son’s service dog was removed and put into the city pound without allowing me the federally mandated, and legally protected, reasonable amount of time to seek someone to take custody of her. The officer from what I understand of the service dog laws outlined by the ADA website, violated federal law that protects these working animals and their handlers. We broke a state law in hopes of saving my son. In turn, our son’s federal rights as protected under the ADA laws were violated because of ignorance of what the laws state regarding service animal identification, and the federal laws dictating how a service dog with an incapacitated handler must be treated. How do we at the least help this department repair their ignorance of the federal laws? I asked people who advocate for the understanding of laws concerning service animals if I was incorrect in what I read. They explained what the laws state for each thing specifically that happened. They cannot legally tell me who was right or wrong as we all have a right to tell our own side of every story without the assumption of guilt. On my own reporting, I did, in fact, understand the laws that I believe were violated. I now have an obligation to become an advocate myself when our son is back in our arms and living his beautiful, young life.She is our son’s link to the conscious world when he is trapped in the grips of those seizures and cannot cry for help himself. She is his voice, his hero, and his Angel. She has a job that has improved all of our lives from him choking on his own vomit in his sleep because she will make sure someone hears her and gets to him. Instead of being treated as a valuable life and life saving dog, she was thrown into her own type of prison for 7 days. “Actually innocent, but decidedly guilty based on ignorance of the law” is what I would name that kind of charge. Seven days this life saving animal went without anyone she knew, strange foods, strange scheduling, strange dogs (who knows if they were friendly or not), exposure to a myriad of diseases, and was treated like an animal thrown away.  Vaccinations are our first line defense, but they do, on occasion fail our dogs. She risks that when she leaves our house. Just as we risk being attacked by a shark if we swim in the ocean. We know the risk, and that is why we do not jump into known, high shark activity laden waters with an open wound. Pounds cannot help except to be a possible breeding ground for diseases. They must house stray dogs whether they know the histories of the dogs or not. They cannot deny going and picking up a dog reported just because they do not know if it has had vaccinations. They can quarantine if equipped for that, and if the pound has adequate space and vet staff. Our son’s service dog is priceless in alerting to get David help, and she was cast aside just like our son’s childhood and quality of life. She has this way that is unique to them to speak to his whole mind and assure him that he is going to open his eyes to her again. She is amazing, and deserves to always be treated as such. We do not want to risk losing the only link we have to him to assure him that Matt and mommy are fighting for him when he cannot see and hear us. This wonderful, furry, angel tells him so. She wants her boy back almost as much as we do.Because of all of this, we want to move our child and family to a state with the medical resources to help him. We have found a lawyer who is the best of the best. She has reviewed and has been very optimistic in her ability to help us get our son back, and move him to a place where he can be monitored with regulated, specially grown marijuana that is designed to treat his individual needs uniquely. Our son deserves life. I am asking for help to save our son. Please donate if you are able so that we can hire this attorney and save him. If you are unable to donate, please understand that we are in deepest appreciation of prayers for our son to be okay and be a little boy riding his bike, and looking forward to going to school again, and so proud and excited when he learns new things and makes good grades. This just hurts so badly. We feel so afraid for him, and everything in both of us cries and screams to save him. We do not know if he is being cared for like a child or a case number. We only hear things that bother us deeply, and all we can do is turn it over to the lawyer to now fight the greatest battle of our lives in having our heart returned to us safe and sound and knowing that we now know the correct path of helping him, and can do this the legal way. It has proven to be the correct way by the medical evidence of only 71 days alone. Please, help us if you are able. We only want our baby back and to see him play and grow without fear of these seizures that were stealing him away from us before he was taken away by DCFS. We want all of him back, and have proven that we will do anything to protect him. The difference is that now, we are educating ourselves on the correct way, and imagining an even better outcome for his health with the proper care.Thank You! https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid?sharetype=teams&member=227462&rcid=r01-152732054834-745a05a4a60247a6&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m",988,2.5k,20,959,3 months,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Among many things, SJS attacks the mucus membranes and left his lungs severely damaged. He went from being a successful multisport athlete and student, to one that struggled aerobically on the field. Not willing to quit, he trained to become a Goal Keeper hoping he could reduce the cardiovascular demands on his body and hoping he could continue to play the game he loved. Dylan adjusted to his new base line of 50% lung capacity and still competed at some of the highest club and high school soccer levels. His teammates will remember him as the player who finished the runs long after the rest of the team, but he always finished. His determination and commitment to everything he did was admirable. Over the past 4 years his lungs declined further from a MRSSA infection and then Pneumonia. At 18%, he had to make the hardest call of his life to the college coach he had committed to play soccer for in Minnesota; his primary concern was not himself, but for the teammates that he knew would depend on him. Evaluation began in September 2017 at University of Washington Medical Center for potential Bilateral Lung Transplant. On Saturday, July 14th Dylan received the incredible gift of new Lungs from a donor, something he can only repay by making the same commitment to life he always has. This type of organ transplant is a very intensive surgery that comes with life-long requirements for medications and treatments. The love and support of all his family and friends has gotten him through this and his motivation to use this gift in positive ways is evident in everything he does.""Want to succeed as bad as you want to breath"" ~Dylan",142,383,9,142,1 month,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

My husband’s name is Stephen Boulanger and he has been struggling with brain cancer since November 2008. If any of you know Steve personally then you would know what a fun, amazing person he is. He has always been really smart and witty. He is a loving husband and father to two young children and a great friend to many. I think one of my favorite things about Steve is that he can always make me laugh. I mean really laugh like until your sides start to hurt laugh. I love this about him! Steve has gone through so much in his young life and it really hasn’t been fair, but he has still found hope despite the challenges.   I honestly don’t know how he has managed to stay so upbeat and positive. He keeps fighting and I admire him greatly for this.  I will never forget when Steve was first diagnosed with a brain tumor. I was actually with him when he had a sudden grand mal seizure in a coffee shop. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and we later discovered that the seizure was caused by a golf ball sized grade 2 oligoastrocytoma. This discovery would change our lives forever. Steve had an awake craniotomy (brain surgery) in December 2008 to have the tumor removed.  The surgery was successful, but the tumor began to return a few years later in October 2011, at which time Steve wasrequired to undergo six weeks of radiation treatment. I have to brag and say how strong my husband was during the radiation treatment. He received radiation every morning before work and then worked a full day of work without skipping a beat. It really amazes me how he did this without complaint.  You would never have known that he was receiving radiation treatment.   After a few stable years, the tumor began to grow again, and Steve underwent a second awake brain surgery in  September 2016.   A portion of the tumor was removed, but they couldn’t get it all without risking paralyzing him.  Unfortunately, the tumor started to grow again and Steve underwent another series of radiation treatments. This was followed by chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful.  The tumor was growing. Steve started experiencing alarming symptoms that were caused by the tumor. His right arm and right leg became very weak.  He began a new chemotherapy but again the tumor was spreading. Steve had to stop working and continues to be unable to work.  He has lost mobility in his right arm and right leg.  He is also experiencing short term memory issues. We are waiting to see if we are eligible to receive an experimental chemotherapy drug that is very expensive. We may be able to receive this drug as a charitable donation through the company.  Please pray that we do.  Steve has also started eating a Keto diet.  There have been some successful studies and testimonials that show that the Keto diet can help people with brain tumors and we are praying that Steve’s tumor shrinks while on this new way of eating.  Right now, I am Steve’s primary care giver.   I am unable to work because Steve needs daily care.  It has been heartbreaking to watch the person you love the most go through so many struggles.   My children are also watching their Daddy struggle and this is tough as well.  We are asking for donations, however big or small, to help with medical expenses, food for his new diet, and living expenses.  We feel so blessed to have supportive family and friends.   Please consider donating to this fund and if not, then please pray for Steve.   We are praying for a miracle.

Backstory:  As many of you know, 6 months ago, our Dad (Dan Frost), was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. His particular type of cancer is rare and more complex than the majority of prostate cancer cases. Because of this, choosing the right treatment has taken time. The last 6 months we have watched our parents spend countless hours researching, meeting with multiple oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and looked at almost every alternative medicine path available. After much prayer and seeking wisdom in an extremely difficult decision process, our Dad has finally felt peace and made a decision to move forward with 7 weeks of radiation treatment at UCLA Medical Center. He will have two different kinds of radiation that will both target the tumors on his prostate and the area surrounding the prostate, where cancer cells may have migrated.We are a family that believes in the power of prayer and a God who is more than able to heal cancer completely! While we cry out daily to see our Dad healed in this way, we know that he is faithfully walking out the course the Lord has him on for now. Plot Twist: One week away from his scheduled treatment, Dad and Mom received a 30 day notice to leave their home of seven years. Their landlord is selling the property they have been renting in Redding, CA. Because they need to be in LA for 2 months of treatment for Dad, they now only have two weeks to be out of their house. They are quickly packing up their home and placing all their belongings in storage. A few of us kids are taking some time off work to fly out to help them pack and take care of the heavy lifting. They will head to LA with just their suitcases and car, but expectant for God to show them the next steps toward a home. Strongest people we know need help:If you know our story, you know that 17 years ago our parents were called into full time ministry working with political leaders on Capitol Hill. They’ve poured out their life and finances to serve the kingdom. They haven’t skipped a beat in spite of cancer and are continuing to serve. Through this season so many of you have asked us how you can help. As their family we would love if you joined with us in covering them in this process.Prayers:We first and foremost need your prayers. Will you join us as we cover our Dad in the following areas: - Seeking God with us in seeing our Dad’s body completely healed. - Pray for God’s presence and wisdom to guide every doctor in this complicated treatment. - Pray that treatment attacks cancer in every location of our Dad’s body and that it won’t return. - Pray for both our parents to have supernatural strength and that the stress of all the details won’t take a toll on their spirits or bodies.Finances:Cancer not only comes with a heavy burden health wise, but also with a hefty price tag. We are watching our parents bills grow with medical expenses, scans/treatments that are not covered by insurance, cost of travel to appointments out of state, lodging, prescriptions and now the expenses of moving and finding a new home. It is our hearts to go above and beyond to help cover all the extra costs associated with this journey. We would love if you considered joining us by helping them financially. Every little bit helps and will give them one less thing they have to worry about during this incredibly difficult time. Thank you:We also want to recognize and thank all of you who have showed up for our parents in the most profound ways.  Your prayers, notes, phone calls, texts, financial support, houses, helping hands and so much more has so deeply touched the hearts of our parents. We often receive phone calls with our parents in tears from the kindness and generosity that has been shown to them from so many. We can confidently say they have felt so surrounded and loved in this process. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us hold up our parents arms up during a time when they are needing it most!

Medical,22,Healing Hendrix,https://www.gofundme.com/HendrixTorres,"SAN DIEGO, CA","May 20, 2018","$50,000","$49,491","Dear Friends & Family, Most of you are aware that our son Hendrix has been having a pretty rough time the last couple of months. We now think everything began this past November when he was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. Soon after that diagnosis, we noticed he started having motor tics and began complaining of neck pain, nausea and stomachaches. About that same time he started having difficulty at school, pulling away from friends, sports and all of the things he normally loved to do. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of our story. On February 13th, with no previous warning, Hendrix began shaking uncontrollably, slurring his words and making jerky, uncoordinated movements. His eyes were dilated and he was exhibiting the signs and symptoms of a stroke, brain tumor, or a seizure disorder. As you can imagine, even though Jalayne is an RN, we were very scared, especially since Hendrix himself asked to go to the hospital because he could not control his own body. We drove him to the ER, but on the way Hendrix became extremely confused and did not remember where we were going or why. By the time we saw a doctor, Hendrix returned to normal and after a short assessment, he was discharged. Unfortunately, over the next week, Hendrix deteriorated rapidly and was unable to attend school and both of us were unable to go to work.  On the night of the 22nd, Hendrix became so unhinged that we called 911 and left for the ER in restraints in an ambulance. Two hours later, he returned to normal and the hospital discharged him again with nothing more than another basic exam. The next morning, we took Hendrix back to his pediatrician’s office and begged for help and for them to admit him to the hospital for further testing. Finally, Hendrix was admitted to the hospital for three days. After his tests showed relatively normal/benign results, we were told that our son was medically cleared and that we had a behavior issue on our hands and he was discharged. Three hours after that discharge, we had to call 911 again because Hendrix became worse than ever before.  Once again we arrived to the hospital via ambulance with Hendrix on a stretcher. We requested readmission to the medical floor for further testing, but our request was denied since Hendrix had just been medically cleared. We were then advised that the best place for him was the psychiatric unit. We spent three days and two nights in the ER with him waiting for a room to open up on the psychiatric unit. As you might imagine, there are no words to explain the stress, confusion, despair and guilt we felt during that time. Knowing this was a medical issue, we agonized over the best thing to do for our son and ultimately decided to follow our instincts and asked to be discharged immediately.  We returned home and at this point were now in the middle of a full-blown crisis. Our family was completely overwhelmed. It has been devastating for us to helplessly watch the Hendrix we know and love decline and deteriorate physically, mentally, and emotionally right before our eyes. There are no words to describe the nightmare our family has been living. We just wanted our little boy back. After months of dealing with non-responsive caregivers here in California we chose to get on a plane and take Hendrix to the East Coast to see specialists at NYU and St. Peter’s Hospital at Rutgers. So many wonderful souls went out of their way to help us with this complicated, expensive and risky journey traveling across the country with a very sick child. Thankfully the trip was the right decision because Hendrix has finally been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis (along with PANS and Neuropathy) and received his first treatment infusion of IVIG on May 11th just in time for his 10th birthday.  Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain. The doctors believe that the walking pneumonia infection triggered Hendrix’s body to attack his brain causing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as cognitive, memory and movement dysfunction. Hendrix has been plagued with a wax and wane of debilitating symptoms including memory loss, confusion, severe separation anxiety, hallucinations, altered personality and behavior, psychosis, movements that he cannot control, clumsiness, difficulty walking, talking, chewing and swallowing, auditory/sensory issues and sleep disturbances. Basically, his brain is on fire, resulting in a sickness that is nearly impossible to describe. Because of this, we have not been able to leave Hendrix’s side, he has not been able to return to school and we both have been unable to return to work. The positive news is that many children have recovered from encephalitis and the brain has an amazing potential to heal. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment greatly improves his chances of improving. That said, we have a very long and difficult road ahead for all of us. Hendrix needs multiple infusions and extensive cognitive, physical and psychological therapy and at this point we do not know when we will be able to return to work. It's a very scary situation to face.  We continue to live day-by-day and sometimes minute-by-minute. Some days we see more of Hendrix and other days we wonder if we will ever have our son back. We remain positive and are ever hopeful that Hendrix will recover and we will not rest until we have tried everything to save him. We have come to realize that this is more than we can handle alone and are now reaching out to our friends and family asking for help in regards to Hendrix’s medical care and expenses.  We will be grateful for any donation but we completely understand if you are unable to contribute. Prayers for Hendrix and for our family are needed as well.  Thank you!  Beau & Jalayne",359,1.9k,15,367,3 months,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Jason is a light to those who know him; everything he touches feels brighter with his presence. And now it’s our turn to shine a light on him.In the summer of 2013, Jason went for a routine physical and came out with a stage 3 melanoma diagnosis… a battle that continues to this day.

Surgery followed, along with months of PET scans and close monitoring by a team of doctors. Through this all, Jason continued to work and support the family he loves.This spring, doctor’s confirmed Jason’s melanoma had come back with a vengeance (stage 4). As I write, his cancer has spread to his muscle tissue, brain, lungs and heart, and it’s wide-spread in his lymphatic system.

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them. Thank you very much.Dmitry.",429,1.2k,8,435,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Duodenal Atresia is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum (in the small intestine). It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. At one day old, Billy had emergency surgery to correct the “kink” in his small intestine. The surgery was successful though Billy spent 5 weeks recovering in the NICU.Fast forward 30 years later, Billy has been able to live life to the fullest. He graduated Dickinson College with a degree in English. Pursued his passion by attending and graduating Tribeca Film Academy in Chicago. Got his dream job at Cutters Studio working his butt off to become Editor, which he achieved January 2018. He met his best friend and the love of this life, Briggs. Not only did he convince his Southern Belle to move from Atlanta to Chicago but he quickly knew to never let her go and married her on March 28th, 2015. I know Billy would still say that was the best day of his life. Until this year. On March 21st, 2018, Briggs and Billy welcomed their beautiful daughter Ann (Annie) Maynard Montross, named in honor of Annie’s grandmothers. If you asked anyone who knows Billy, they would say he is the nicest, kindest, most thoughtful and patient man they know. An accomplished film editor, golfer, hockey player, baseball player, artist, drummer, food enthusiast. I think my grandmother said it best when we were growing up, Billy is the angel in our family. And he is the rock for his two girls, Briggs and Annie. On Thursday, May 24th, Billy admitted himself into New York Presbyterian Hospital suffering from severe stomach pains, soon to be discover it was stemming from his small intestine. Over the next week, Billy underwent 4 surgeries on his small intestine. The initial surgery was to remove the buildup of scar tissue; however, as his condition evolved and his body attempted to recover, his small intestine did not survive his surgeries. Billy is now left with approximately 2 inches remaining of his small intestine (for size reference, the small intestine can range from 9 feet to 35 feet). He is being administered TPN (total parenteral nutrition) through an IV to provide his body the essential nutrients, as he cannot eat or drink, and has a G tube connected to a colostomy bag to continually drain his stomach.He is still in the hospital in NYC. He is making progress with regaining his strength and we hope to have him home within the next week or so.  Billy, Briggs, Annie and the Montross family has been so appreciative of people’s love, support, thoughts and prayers over the past month. Billy has a very long road ahead of him. Thank you for visiting and please keep checking back. All donations made on Go Fund Me will go to assist in paying for Billy's medical bills / small intestine transplant.

This was followed by a setback, when an artery in his brain burst and caused localized bleeding in the surrounding tissues. Doug is currently in rehabilitation hospital in Denver. He was released there after two weeks at the hospital. He is expected to return home for continued therapy there  on April 20th. From there it is expected he will have months of therapy before there is hope of a full recovery.Many of you know Doug as a long-standing Aspen Valley resident and manager of Rustique. Anyone who knows Doug knows him as a generous and kind person. My sister and I are so lucky to have him as our brother, he's always there for support and encouragement. He selflessly offered his time and energy to take care of our mother after her medical problems, taking her into his home. Recently he has had such happiness come into his life- a beautiful fiancé named Nok, a growing family (four kids), a new house, a new baby and an exciting new job as a Director of Food and Beverage for a hotel in the Snowmass area.  This stroke can be devastating for Doug and his family. Doug is a fighter!

He was 24 and newly married to his wife, Amanda. By the grace of our loving Lord, he enjoyed almost three years of clear scans. As of November 2017, Matt has been in another intense treatment phase. The tumor has regrown and for the moment, continues to grow. BUT GOD. He is making ways in the wilderness, streams in the wasteland. (Isaiah 43:19). We serve a miracle-working God who has already payed the price for our salvation and our healing. (1 Peter 2:24) The unconventional treatment that Matt is in now offers a lot of hope. It is a 12-hour a day job for both he and Amanda, but it is where God has led them, and that is all they need to know to stay on the path He has directed. He is currently into the newest protocol which includes 140+ pills a day, 96 ounces of fresh-pressed juice, multiple doctor’s appointments each week, ongoing consults with doctors across the southeast and outside of the country. The treatments being pursued are not covered by insurance and the costs are staggering. But God always provides. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.” - Matthew 10:29-31 Be steadfast in prayer. We believe we are weeks, days, even minutes away from seeing complete healing in Matt’s body. And that may sound crazy, BUT we know He has already commanded it. He is able and willing. God doesn’t change. He is the same God he was in the Bible. His love for Lazarus, the leper, the blind man, is the same as His love for Matt. He doesn’t deny help or any good thing to those who walk uprightly. (Psalm 84:11) Matt and Amanda do not view the costs of his treatment as anyone else's responsibility but our their own and should people choose to bless us financially, any amount is seen as the greatest gift.

Whether it be his podcast The Shoot, his YouTube channel, or his Instagram, Matt has been promoting, educating, and sharing his love of photography for years. He’s given so much to the photographic community at large, and now it’s time we showed our appreciation and gave back to him.I could try and explain what’s going on, but I think it’s best if it came from Matt’s wife Molly herself:“As many of you know, Matt has had a rough few weeks. I just wanted to get the full story out there to fill in the gaps:Last Friday (6/29/18), he told me he had a migraine. When I got home from work Sunday morning, he apparently had been vomiting all night and couldn't tolerate loud sounds or any light, so I took him to the ER for some fluids and a migraine cocktail. This helped for a while, but that night he started to have fevers. By Tuesday, the headache was worse and he had been consistently vomiting and not voiding, so he went back to the ER where he was treated for dehydration and they considered a lumbar puncture, but decided against it at that time and sent him home. He continued to have high fevers at home, and on Wednesday afternoon, he came out of our room and was covered in a rash and confused. I took him back to the ER and he ended up being admitted. All night his vitals were off. He received lots of fluids to bring his blood pressure up and his heart rate down. He had to be placed on a cooling blanket to bring down his fever. He was eventually moved to the ICU stepdown unit where he has been ever since to closely monitor him. Infectious disease is confident that this is a result from either a tick-borne illness or West Nile virus. He has received doxycycline for the tick illnesses. He is experiencing quite a few complications. He now has pneumonia, a UTI, and inflammation in his brain. His vitals are better now, but today he is experiencing some neurological symptoms that are concerning, so he will be transferred to Riverside. He is stable and talking, he just needs a higher level of care at this point. Thank you so much to all of my wonderful coworkers who have given him THE BEST care. Thank you to all of our friends and family for your help with kids and animals. Thank you for all of your prayers and good vibes sent. He certainly needs them right now. ❤️”Thoughts and prayers are certainly appreciated, but I know we can do more for the Day family right now. The medical expenses for Matt’s treatment and hospital visits are tough on any family, so let’s rise up together and show some monetary support! I reached out to Molly to make sure she was okay with launching this and she has given her blessing. So donate knowing that all money will go right to the Day family.Any size donation/contribution will be appreciated. And if you can’t donate, please spread the word!

Jeremy and Joslyn were finally blessed with their first pregnancy in 2017 after about a year of fertility treatments because they weren’t conceiving on their own. Joslyn has wanted to be a mommy forever. Joslyn and Jeremy had their first child on Monday 6/18/2018, but it was not the fairytale birth and celebration that every parent hopes for. Joslyn had to be induced early (about a month) and during the preparation for induction, Joslyn began having severe breathing issues. She lost consciousness and she flatlined for 15 minutes. They were able to get the baby out within five minutes of Joslyn flat-lining. Both mom and baby are fighting hard for their lives. Joslyn remains in an induced coma to allow her brain and body to heal from all the trauma. Baby is also in an induced coma. Both mom and baby are stable at this time, but the prognosis is still completely up in the air at this point. Staying in the hospital in ICU and NICU for a day is insanely costly and both Joslyn and baby have been in the hospital about five days now.

It was determined the bacteria entered her system through an ear infection she had been battling.  As of today, August 9th, she remains in a coma.  My sister Kristen is the loving mother of two young children Rylie age 9 & Grayson age 5. Together with her husband James, they lived a simple life in the hills surrounding Waynesville, North Carolina. With simple means, they lived in a rental house they’ve made their own. With what they lacked in means, they made up with love. The four of them are inseparable, and now tragedy has struck their lives.  It’s been two weeks now, and Kristen remains unresponsive.  With her family by her side, her doctors are not giving up hope for improvement.To make matters worse, last night, August 8th, as rains continue to fall in Western North Carolina, a massive tree fell on their home making it uninhabitable. They are now homeless. While their mother lays in bed unaware, her two children and husband face another setback. They need help. They need housing.  I'm starting this page because people have been calling me and asking ""what can I do?""  As someone who has always tried to help organizations and causes in my community, I am now asking the community for help back.  Any help you can give will help us secure a temporary rental for James and the children, pay medical bills that will mount and bring some sense of normalcy back to my niece and nephew's lives.  I leave this in your hands, the reader, to give what you can.  This tragedy has reminded me that family is first.  If there is any silver lining to this dreadful story, it's inspired me to be more present in my family's lives.  Let this be a lesson for all of us.  God bless.  Thank you.",430,1.0k,5,424,24 days,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,23,Help Matt Cremen,https://www.gofundme.com/help-matt-cremen,"Bronxville,","July 18, 2018","$45,000","$48,585","Back in June of 2016, little did Matt know that life as he knew it would change forever. Now, Matt needs an Intestinal Transplant.Matt has been diagnosed with a condition called myopathic pseudo-obstruction .  This means that the smooth muscles that move food along in his digestive tract, have stopped working.  As a result, he can no longer eat and has daily episodes of extreme vomiting.  Since he cannot eat, he needs to be fed intravenously with TPN (Total Parental Nutrition) .  Each night he is hooked up to his TPN and it runs over the course of 12 hours, in order for him to live.While TPN is a lifesaver, it comes with some serious long term complications.  TPN is extremely hard on the liver and many people that are on TPN for an extended amount of time will go into liver failure.  In addition, line infections are quite common (Matt has already had two) and can lead to sepsis.  Other health issues associated with long term TPN are developing osteoporosis, cholecystitis and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.The only “cure” for myopathic pseudo-obstruction, is an intestinal transplant.   An intestinal transplant  is the most complex and rare of all the organ transplants.  To give you an idea, last year there were only 109 intestinal transplants compared to 19,850 kidney transplants in the United States.  Due to it rarity and complexity, it is also the most expensive single medical procedure in the U.S., costing a whopping $1.2 million dollars.While Matt has health insurance that will cover the bulk of the medical expenses, there are many additional financial aspects of care and recovery, which are not covered by insurance.  He will spend the first five days in the ICU and is expected to be in the hospital anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks.  During this time his wife will need to take unpaid time off from work, especially in the very beginning.  Dana will be able to stay at a “transplant house” for the first few days after his surgery that is just blocks from hospital, but it is not free.  Once Matt is stable and moved from the ICU, Dana will return home to get back to work and be there for their two girls, Madison and Alexis.During the remainder of his hospital stay Dana and their daughters will commute into the city as often as possible to visit Matt.  Whether it’s by car or mass transit, the costs of going into the city will quickly add up.  Once Matt is finally discharged, he will be coming home on approximately 20 medications, which will cost around $1250 - $1,500 a month out of pocket.  He may also need in home nursing care, which is only partially covered by insurance.  Matt will also need to make weekly trips back into the city to ensure he is progressing and not having an issues with rejection or graft vs. host disease.  With intestinal transplants, there can be many ups and downs over the course of the first year and additional hospital stays are not uncommon.  In addition to the upcoming expenses, his existing medical bills are just under $8,000.  Thank you for considering donating, it's greatly appreciated! It doesn't matter how big or small the donation is, everything helps!",318,986,14,319,1 month,1 hour ago,26 days,2018-09-03

Steve is an inspiration to me and I’m sure to many of you as well. As many of you are aware, Steve and his wonderful family find themselves battling cancer for the third time. He’s been receiving monthly chemo/immunotherapy treatments at the Mayo Clinic since August 2017. While the treatments have stopped cancer growth in some areas, other areas continue to grow. As a result of genomic testing of the cancer, it was discovered that his cancer is most likely being driven by a specific mutation in the BRAF Gene. While there is no FDA approved targeted therapy for this specific BRAF mutation, MD Anderson is running a Phase 1 clinical trial with a drug that they believe has a chance to work on his cancer. Steve and Wendy traveled to Houston this week where he has been going through 3 days of multiple tests and a biopsy of one of the tumors. Fortunately, Steve has passed the screening and has been accepted into the trial that is testing the drug LXH254. This drug was developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. His first day on the trial will be Monday, April 16th. Steve and his family are grateful to his team of doctors at Mayo Clinic, who referred him to MD Anderson.While these treatments provide Steve with hope, they also bring forth tremendous costs, and I am hoping as a community we can assist the Rogers family in this battle against this awful disease. All funds raised will help with the living, travel, and out of pocket treatment costs the Rogers family will incur on this journey to defeat cancer for the final time!We will be updating the Post Hope website many of you are familiar with during Steve’s previous fight.  https://posthope.org/steve-rogers",172,158,4,171,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The Poulsen family received news that Chris had two masses in his brain and one in his lungs. After a biopsy and imaging, Chris was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic melanoma and has since began radiation treatment. Chris and Jenny have four beautiful children: Riley (16), Ashton (14), Aiden (11), and Anders (7). Everyone that meets Chris is struck by his warmth, gentle soul, and humility.
Chris worked for 10 years in the advertising industry. At 34, Chris decided on a career change and spent the next four years in dental school followed by a periodontal residency. Chris wanted to provide the best life for Jenny and their children. Of course, this came with great sacrifice for Chris and Jenny, not to mention hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. 
In 2014, Chris purchased Post Falls Periodontics and has been tirelessly working to get the practice off the ground and establish a life  in North Idaho.  Chris was just beginning to make his mark in  the periodontal field and realize some return on his sacrifice and investment when the family received this terrible news. With his livelihood in jeopardy, it is uncertain how the family will cover the crushing medical bills that are sure to come, the rent on their home,  and basic day to day needs.

My wife Jules and I are shocked and saddened utterly devastated to announce that our lives have been completely upended by the discovery of what looks to be stage 4 neuroblastoma in our amazing 15 month old daughter Karin Quinn aka “Kiki.”Whether you call her Karin, Quinn, Kiki or Baby Q, the fact remains- she is amazing and uniquely fun, smart, and beautiful- our only daughter and the center of our world. On June 14, Jules and Barbara Dockery took Quinn to her pediatrician to check out whether Baby’s cute pot belly was anything to worry about.  He recommended an ultrasound to be sure. She immediately underwent an ultrasound procedure at Tarzana Children’s Hospital which revealed a large mass on her liver. Julie and Quinn were transported via ambulance to UCLA for admission. Here we remain. An MRI and CT scan revealed that Quinn has what appears to be a rare, aggressive and particularly lethal form of cancer known as neuroblastoma, an evil disease that lurks in healthy babies and then strikes. In diagnosing this disease, Kiki underwent two biopsies, one on the mass itself (about the size of potato, located next to her liver), and another sample from her pelvic bone. They are anticipating that the cancer has spread to her bones.  It will take more time to confirm this, but what is being discussed now is the reality of stage four neuroblastoma. This is as bad as it gets. In our future is the entire spectrum of aggressive cancer treatments. Our precious baby will be subjected to Chemo, radiation, surgery, stem cells, and possibly be brought to the brink of death in order to heal from this terrible disease.  No less than 3 lives are on the line. The outpouring of support we’ve received from our friends and family is incredible.  Many have asked what, if anything can be done to help. First, hug your loved ones and be kind to them. Second, donate blood, if you can. Third, send healing thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to baby Quinn. We really really need to catch a lucky break. Without prompting, Julie’s sister Crystal initiated this gofundme page in support of Kiki.  We are NOT expecting donations but we understand that for many, donating to be a part of Quinn’s fund will feel like a concrete step on the road to recovery, and we are grateful for the support.

This is a man who doesn't leave the house without singles in his pocket so that he always has something to give street performers or just someone in need. And now we're asking for that same spirit of generosity he shows everyone around him to be paid forward to Nikki and his growing family. Nikki and Annie are approaching this daunting year ""with as much hope, determination and positivity as possible.""  Let's help them keep positive and focused by lightening the load of medical bills, trips to the hospital, general expenses and possible time off from employment to focus on healing.  Prayers for a full and easy recovery are also deeply appreciated.  Thank you.",356,859,4,359,1 month,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

After numerous operations attempting to relieve the pressure in his brain, we find ourselves on the edge of our seats in the ICU. Because his pressures (both brain and blood) are still too high, the doctors have had him sedated throughout the process, and we have no idea as to what type of damage has been done to his brain and body. For those that don’t know, my dad has operated his own family run, small business for the last 20+ years as a Chiropractor, earnestly seeking to improve the quality of life of everyone he comes into contact with. Famous for providing more care for less money, dad did whatever it took to leave his patients better than he found them, while still providing for his family. However, because my family’s only source of income was my father’s business, we now need your help in this difficult time. As we continue to pray for a miracle, my mother has not left his side, and my brothers and I continue to do all we can to ease the pressures of this situation. Though the amount may seem high, the cost of care is already enormous, and even the most optimistic of outcomes leads to at least another 2-3 weeks of 24/7 care in the ICU.

He stole his parents’ hearts as well as many of his Instagram followers with his adorable personality and courageous attitude. At three months old, he underwent heart surgery to repair large hole in his heart. Doctors informed his parents that a second heart surgery would be necessary in two months in order to repair another hole located in his pulmonary valve. This repair will assist Noah with his breathing and overall quality of life. Noah’s parents are doing their best to provide all the necessities that he needs. They recently had him fitted for a cranial doc to repair the shape of his head which is due to his condition.

We live in The Colony, TX and decided to start his cancer treatment in Dallas, Texas in hopes that a few rounds of chemo would be the answer. After 3 rounds of BEP we thought we had the “all clear” but, just before Jan 2018, we found out that the cancer was back and had started to spread. We decided to seek a second opinion and made the drive to MD Anderson in Houston, TX for further treatment. They started Michael on an aggressive treatment of TIP chemo in hopes they could slow the cancer from spreading. After a week-long stay in the hospital we were discharged with the news that the TIP chemo was not effective. The doctors at MD Anderson suggested an RPLND surgery to physically remove all traces of the tumor.The RPLND surgery occurred on 4/13/18 and Michael recovered well. His blood work seemed to show we were cancer free. Towards the middle of May, Michael was having severe back pain accompanied with abdominal bloating. We traveled down to MD Anderson for the post-op appointments and found out Michael’s cancer was back and more aggressive than ever. They started Michael on chemo right away to try and slow down the cancer’s progression.Michael’s doctors at MD Anderson have told us that traditional cancer therapy (chemo, radiation, etc.) will not cure his cancer and that we should seek alternative therapy. We are currently working with a holistic doctor in Denver, CO to develop a treatment plan for Michael. Unfortunately, this alternative treatment is not covered by insurance, but Michael and I are willing to do whatever it takes to find a cure for his disease.

Medical,25,Juniper's Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/juniper039s-journey,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN","June 23, 2018","$15,000","$47,035","Juniper’s Journey:After meeting in college (CSB/SJU!), Colin and I became best friends and fell in love. From the early stages of our relationship, it became clear that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We got engaged in Alaska and had an amazing wedding nearly five years ago. We’ve been together for over ten years now. We’ve always dreamt that our life together would include children, and over two years ago, we started trying for our first child. That was a journey of its own...as many can attest to, we (naively) did not anticipate difficulty in conceiving a child. The morning after Thanksgiving in 2017, I was brushing my teeth and decided to take a pregnancy test. It was positive. Have you ever felt a joy so electric that it completely takes over every fiber of your being? This was that feeling, and that feeling continued to grow as baby grew too. At our 21-week anatomy scan, we found out that it’s a girl! Luckily, we had already agreed on the perfect name for our sweet summer daughter - Juniper.The days following that scan turned our happiness and excitement into what can only be described as primal fear. We received a very unexpected call that we would need to have a follow-up appointment with the maternal fetal medicine clinic for a level 2 ultrasound, as they were not able to get images of all four chambers of her heart at the anatomy scan. (Cue panic.) What resulted from the level 2 ultrasound raised more specific concerns regarding June’s heart, including a suspected diagnosis of heterotaxy. (Cue confusion and more panic.) We were then referred to the pediatric cardiology team at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, where a fetal echocardiogram revealed yet more details on Juniper’s congenital heart defects and provided us with a clearer pathway to treatment. The incredibly high quality of care we’ve been receiving at the University of Minnesota has helped bring some relief back into our lives; we know we are in great hands there. From what Juniper’s care team can currently determine (in utero), she has several congenital heart defects specific to her condition including HLHS/single ventricle, VSD, ASD, malposition of the great arteries and pulmonary atresia, in addition to her stomach being on the right side of her body. Essentially, this means that she will need a series of surgeries in order to maintain function of her heart and other organs to be able to live out her life like she very much deserves to do. Currently, she is projected to have four heart surgeries throughout her life...the first of which will happen soon after she is born. Since success of the first surgery will be dependent on a multitude of assessments made at birth, we are looking at a lengthy first stay in the hospital for recovery time before we can take our daughter home.The time we will both be able to spend with our new baby while she is in the NICU/CICU will be so important for many reasons; being present to make important medical decisions regarding her recovery and future outlook, gaining knowledge and skills to be able to care for her special needs in and out of the hospital, and of course, loving on her as much as is humanly possible.We’ve wanted this beautiful baby for so long and we have been saving up the best we can, though we could never have anticipated our version of parenthood to look quite like this. Though I am fortunate enough to have qualified for 12 weeks of FMLA leave and can use what little sick time I’ve accrued in my first year of teaching, the remainder is all unpaid. Colin can use some hours he’s saved up to take some paid time off, but he has recently been informed of an unexpected transition in position which has resulted in a reduction of pay. I had intended to teach summer school, but following the advice of our care team, I will instead take these last few weeks of pregnancy to focus on my health. Colin will be working overtime as he can in the weeks left leading up to June’s birth to help supplement our sudden change in income. We are navigating it all the best we can given the cards we have been dealt, but we anticipate that being in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time will prove challenging in more ways than one. During the months of my maternity leave following Juniper’s birth, we will undoubtedly face financial difficulty with bills coming in from all angles, month-to-month expenses on a single, reduced income, medical supplies and medications we will need when we make the transition home, hospital life (meals, parking, etc.), and very importantly, saving up for all of the above when we go through this yet again for future surgeries. We are being reminded, over and over again, that life never stops, even when you’re in desperate need of a pause button. If we could alleviate at least one of the difficulties our family will face in the uncertain times ahead, it could really help us adjust to our new normal in the long run, whenever that may be. If you know us, you know that we’ve put off setting up this GoFundMe for quite some time. (Turns out it is really difficult to ask for help when you’d much rather give it than put yourself out there to receive it...especially when it involves financial support.) But, after a lot of encouragement and strong suggestion from our loved ones in light of recent events, we decided to open it up and accept any and all assistance offered to us. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. We appreciate all of you.So much love from our family to yours,Chelsea and Colin Clark",256,876,15,258,2 months,14 hours ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Nathaniel set off to hike and climb Forbidden Peak, a famous climbing destination in the North Cascades. During his climb, he fell over 150 feet and sustained a severe spinal cord injury. Due to the actions of his climbing partner and another pair of climbers, Nathaniel was safely airlifted off the mountain to Harborview Medical Center. He underwent a successful surgery to stabilize his injuries, but the current prognosis is still dire - due to the damage on his C2-C7 vertebrae, he initially had no sensation or mobility below his neck.  But we’ve been witnessing small miracles this week, as he is now able to move his left arm, so we’re still hopeful for more improvements. He is currently still in the ICU, and is unable to breathe on his own at this time. Nathaniel had just completed his first year at the Dental School at the University of Washington, and he was passionate about many subjects and his thirst for exploration pushed him to pursue a life in the outdoors. He spent many hours in the calmness and beauty of Washington’s wilderness and climbing areas. Our hopes and dreams as a family is that he may one day return to the great outdoors.

Medical,25,Colleen Stevens &  Family,https://www.gofundme.com/colleenstevens,"SPRINGFIELD, IL","March 18, 2018","$50,000","$46,990","Colleen is a 34 year old mother of three young children ages 6, 4, 1 and is married to her loving husband Joe.  On January 31, 2018, she went into respiratory arrest due to a very rare autoimmune disease called Wegener's Granulomatosis.  This caused a complete blockage in her airway that caused her to then go into respiratory arrest and caused an ischemic stroke.  She was in ICU for several days and then admitted into the hospital for weeks where she lost her ability to speak, was blind for several days, lost movement of her legs and hands.  She was finally moved to the physical therapy floor of the hospital where she worked to regain her speech, learned to walk again, and was regaining her movement in her hands, legs, and vision was slowly coming back.  After 27 days, she was released to go home and entered out patient therapy.  We thought this was the end of her hospital story,  and we were looking forward to watching her regain her independence back....but it wasn't even close to the end of the story.Last Saturday, Colleen's husband Joe rushed Colleen to the ER with shortness of breath and another restricted airway.   She was released and the following day they headed to St. Louis to see her specialist at Barnes Hospital.  On their way, Colleen had ANOTHER blockage of her airway and her husband had to perform the Heimlich Maneuver to move the large obstruction.  Her specialist put her on high dosage of steroids to try and help the blockages that were forming.  They went home and the next morning (TUES.) she woke up and felt like her airway was BLOCKED again.  We took her to the ENT where she was checked and released but two hours later felt that the blockage was still there.  We took her back to the ENT where they discovered a 98% blockage was below her vocal cords not above them as we have always thought.  She was immediately rushed into surgery and released the next day to go home on Wednesday.  By Thursday morning, she again woke up at home to a feeling of another blockage of her airway.  We rushed her to the ER, where they discovered another blockage under her vocal cords. These blockages were being removed and coming back within 24 hours and blocking her entire airway.  They immediately took her for her SECOND surgery and put her into the hospital to be monitored 24 hours a day.  They gave her high doses of steroids hoping that might help but by Friday morning these blockages were back and Colleen was going in for her THIRD surgery in THREE days.At this point, we were devastated by this news.  We needed help.  Her doctors at Memorial Hospital and her doctor at Barnes were working together to find out as much as possible regarding Wegener's and what could be done to help her.  Her doctor at Barnes was able to contact doctors at Harvard and Cleveland to find out some good information on treatment. By Saturday morning, Colleen had her FOURTH surgery in FOUR days to remove yet ANOTHER blockage.  After a lot of discussions by the doctors at Memorial, Barnes, Harvard, and Cleveland they removed the blockage and also injected steroids and topical chemotherapy into the trachea.  They also started Colleen on a chemotherapy drug, which will be given once a week for four weeks to try and help her.  She will continue to be in the hospital so that they can monitor her 24 hours a day and be sure she has a clear airway daily and hope that the chemotherapy treatment along with the steroid injections all work together to put her Wegener's in remission.  Colleen's husband Joe has been out of work for over a month now and will continue to have to stay with her until the doctors give the okay for her to go home.  They are going to need to add a system to their two home heating and air systems that adds moisture into their house.  The stress alone of being in the hospital away from your kids would make it hard on any family and then add in regular bills, the doctors bills and the continued physical therapy Colleen will still need when she does come home, and the heating/air system that is essential for her to have that this family just needs some help from family, friends, and maybe even the kindness of strangers.  So many of you have reached out to help, so I think this would be a great way to help alleviate some of the stress that the Stevens family  has due to this horrific disease that has turned this family's world upside down. Thank you to all those willing to help them during their time of need.",451,925,5,455,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

The most devastating was to see that all of the cancer was sitting on her aorta which made the procedure life-threatening if they continued. With top experts on the phone from all over the county, and those in the operating room, the collective decision was to not proceed and leave everything as is. Onto the next treatment plan she went which included more chemo as soon as her body was able to handle it.One can only imagine how strong the fight is, and has been. And if you know anything about the Torosyan family, you know what a unit they are. Through the aftershocks, much time has been taken from work to focus on what is most important - family, and the time spent together supporting one another.Many have asked how they can join in their support.

I have been suffering debilitating motor symptoms including tremors, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems as a result of Early Onset Parkinson’s Disease for many years. During this time I have continued to work full time to provide for my son John's care and multiple therapies as he grows up with autism.  Just recently, I have taken advantage of a small window of opportunity to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure for Parkinson's patients that requires several steps, each with mounting medical expenses.  A battery-operated device is implanted in the chest (similar to a pacemaker) to deliver electrical stimulation to the areas of the brain that control movement. The hope is that ultimately, I can continue to be an active participant in John’s life.   On June 19, 2018, the first surgery was successfully performed where a thin, insulated wire was inserted into my skull and implanted in the brain. On July 3, an implantable pulse generator (IPG) will be implanted in my chest. The IPG will then be programmed to block abnormal electrical signals and alleviate the Parkinson’s Disease motor symptoms.  I have developed this GoFundMe Page to help offset some of these out-of-pocket expenses.Please forward this email and link to anyone I might have forgotten.  Thank you so much for your generous donation.",185,175,3,189,2 months,1 month ago,1 month,2018-09-03

It was VERY big, so big I was a few days away from it crushing my heart and causing it to stop.I need to get radiotherapy to ensure the cancer doesn´t return BUT, radiation to the chest (mediastinum) has a high probability of causing heart disease and secondary tumors--cancers caused by radiation that pop up 10-20 years after receiving the radiotherapy. I discovered that the most advanced form of radiotherapy is called ""Proton Therapy"" which reduces exposure to radiation of healthy tissue, almost eliminating the toxicity of traditional radiotherapy and it´s side-effects. There are very few places around the planet that offer it (less than 50 as far as I can tell) which makes it extremely expensive. I´ve found a place in northeastern Italy which does it for a fraction of what it costs in the US and other places.I need the funds ASAP so I can secure my spot, since I need to start treatment on August 16th, 2018.  I am 48 years YOUNG! and a father to a sweet, loving and smart 3 year old boy and husband to my beautiful and wise wife, and I NEED TO BE AROUND FOR MANY DECADES MORE!I´ve spent the last 32 years of my life doing my best to help people learn how to have more fulfilling lives, and I feel like I´ve just gotten started.

In Connor's 10 short years on this earth, he touched more lives than most of us will in the 7 or 8 decades we are given. Connor suffered a ruptured AVM (brain) three weeks ago. In true Connor form, he miraculously was recovering from what most people die from. His mother, Alaina, used her fast-acting mom and nurse skills to contribute to the early interventions that gave him a fighting chance. Unfortunately, Connor developed a fast-acting pneumonia while hospitalized which spread to his bloodstream (sepsis).   Connor was re-intubated and once again fighting for his life. The NJ hospital recognized the critical nature of this illness and accepted they could no longer care for a child this ill. Connor was helicoptered to CHOP where they did everything they could to save his life. Due to lack of oxygen from multisystem organ failure (to make a long story short), Connor's brain suffered. Alaina and Dan made the hardest decision of their lives which was to end Connor's suffering and chose to save the lives of other children by donating Connor's organs. Heroes....an understatement. All of them. As my best friend and hero-mom is preparing to bury her only son, this go-fund-me has been established to help her with Connor's medical bills (3 weeks in the ICU at various hospitals not to mention a helicopter transfer), help with funeral costs (which no mother should have to endure), and help get her and her daughter, Brianna, back on their feet after enduring every mother's worst nightmare. Alaina, a single mother, has been out of work this whole time, and quite frankly deserves time with her daughter to heal and find a ""new normal"" once life calms down. Any help you can give is much appreciated. Trust me when I tell you, kindness is contagious and Alaina will surely give your kindness back to the word once her life calms down. My Baby Connor ..... you are our hero. We love you and miss you so much already.",421,1.1k,7,419,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

He also has a significant hole between the right and left ventricles as well as an enlarged pulmonary artery. Shortly after birth, Oakley had his first heart surgery where a stint was put on his artery, which was a temporary fix to give more time for his heart to grow bigger and stronger. He has now outgrown this stint and underwent his second open heart corrective surgery on May 25th at Boston Children's Hospital (a few days shy of his 1st birthday on May 31) in order to reroute the arteries and patch the hole. Early signs are that the surgery was successful and he is now beginning a long recovery process which will include an extended stay at the hospital for up to a month.  It has been an emotional and trying time for MaryEllen and her husband Shant, but they are doing their best to remain optimistic and praying for the best possible outcome. In response to the outpour of concern from many family and friends asking ""How can I help?"" knowing the amount of surgical expenses from little Oakley's first surgery still piling up and the inevitable amount of bills that will continue to come in that are not covered by insurance, we wanted to provide you all with this path to direct your love and support.

She has had at minimum 10 spinal taps to inject chemo into her spinal fluid to ensure the Leukemia can never travel to her spine and/or brain.  She has spent many a night in the hospital due to fever, dehydration, regular viruses that you and I could fight off easily and a terrible bout with c-diff. Emelina is doing amazing and has gone through all of this like a true warrior princess.  Her happiness and spunk are and always have been in full effect.  Her prognosis is wonderful and at the end of this journey she will be a happy, healthy, thriving 5 year old.  Please consider donating to her fight and to the family to aid in her hospital bills and travel expenses, as they will continue on this journey for the next two years.  No child should ever have to endure this and no parent should have to watch his or her child go through this without any control to take the pain away.  Thank you so much!!! #EmmatheBrave",388,735,20,391,1 month,6 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Doctors told his parents that this was not to be worried about but that they would do another scan in 5 years to check that it hadn't grown. About 2 months ago, Mikey asked if he could try out for football. His mom insisted that he couldn't until another MRI was done to check on his aneurysm. She had some convincing of his medical team to do because she wanted the scan done earlier than they had recommended but they got it done. What they discovered was an absolute shock... there was a new aneurysm, a fuseiform aneurysm in the basilar artery (middle of the brain stem) which was significantly larger in size than his original carotid artery aneurysm. His doctors and parents worked to figure out a plan for almost a month for this rare and difficult diagnosis. His parents were advised to come back in 3 to 6 months to do another check-up and discuss putting in a stent instead of risking surgery to remove the aneurysm from this delicate location.4 days later, on July 4th, Mikey suffered a stroke in his brain stem from a blood clot that had formed. No one could see the blood clot in CTs or an MRI until they did a CT with an angiogram and by then the damage was done. The doctors said it happened within 5 minutes and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. Mikey has been in the ICU ever since.He has now been diagnosed with Locked-In Syndrome with paralysis. This means that the damage done by the stroke in his brain stem has paralyzed him to the extent of no longer being able to move anything except his eyes, and only vertical movement and blinking at that. This is a paralysis that is rare and is unlikely to resolve. The Plan (so far) To provide him with any encouragement and support to recover any of his voluntary muscle movement that he can, (especially in his face and throat). Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy as soon as possible are a must in encouraging any of this recovery.His mom and step dad (Dezaree and Matt Corwin) are already working out the details to renovate their home so that Michael can come home and have the space and access for his supplies and comfort that he needs AFTER he has grown strong enough to be discharged from the ICU and successfully completes a stay in rehabilitation.However, there will be tremendous unforseen costs moving forward with Michael's care that include everything from communication devices, therapies, rehabilitation, etc.Can you help?Any amount of donation and/or support you can give is appreciated more than we can express. Or if you know of anyone or any treatment that we can look into to help our boy, please share your stories with us!PLEASE pass this information along to family, extended family, best friends, friends, friends of friends, charities, do-gooders, etc. in the area and beyond to put their positive vibes, prayers, experiences and donations toward this mighty feat to help our family provide the best support and comfort to him that we can in this life-changing moment.All you have to do is click the donate button above and/or share this link through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, text, etc. Thank you so much, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.#unshakeableMikeyTrent #Mikeystrong",550,4.8k,38,534,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I started working with him, helping on bids and project management, trying to learn everything I could from him.He poured his heart and soul into his work; he cared more than anyone I have ever met. Anyone that knew Shea, knew that when he was right, he was right, and wouldn’t back down. He was warrior in his work and his life. And all the while, he lit up the room with his smile and warmed it with his kindness. As many know, Shea was diagnosed with a brain tumor in the Spring of 2012.He went through countless surgeries and chemo treatments, yet continued to work throughout it all.I’m pretty sure he had some kind of superman powers. But work was what he loved to do.This spring Shea’s cancer took a turn for the worse.He fought to continue, refusing to take rest or leave. He fought until he literally was unable to speak, until he physically could no longer work.In all his stubborn relentless commitment to his work, he cared more about contributing to the success of our division.To make matters worse, he was unable to qualify for any coverage due to his then established illness.As such, Shea and his family have had to fight this battle without any medical assistance whatsoever. Now, despite all his efforts to continue, he is no longer able to support himself or his family.Shea’s wife, Tasha, and their family need to be with him 24/7 now.With this little time Shea has left, there are medical costs accumulating. Shea is a strong, proud, hard-working man that would never ask for your assistance or support. Which is why I am. The hours we work, the heart and soul we pour in to these demanding roles, our work life is our family life, and Shea is family. I’m hoping that we all can come together as family, to help Shea, Tasha and his loved ones in covering the expenses this illness is costing them so they can focus on providing him with the love and support he deserves in his final days.I’m not asking for much, every little bit helps. All I ask is that you consider what it would be like if you were in his shoes, and show some compassion for a man that gave everything he had to help us all succeed.",189,226,0,190,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Medical,28,Kelsey and baby Maxley,https://www.gofundme.com/kelsey-and-baby-fergie,"PRIOR LAKE, MN","June 10, 2018","$100,000","$44,200","My sister, Kelsey, has been through more devastation in the last year than some people deal with in a lifetime.  First, Kelsey and Scott started trying for a baby as soon as they got married in March 2016, but after a year of negative pregnancy tests, they sought the help of a doctor who eventually put Kelsey on fertility meds.  Amazingly they helped and Kelsey was pregnant in July 2017.  Unfortunately in  August 2017, Kelsey and Scott got their first devastating news, they had lost the baby at about 9 weeks.  Kelsey went back on her meds when she was given the all clear from her doctor, and they were lucky to conceive again quickly. They announced to friends and family in November that they were expecting again, due in late July 2018.  They celebrated cautiously knowing what had happened the last time.  When they hit the 20 week mark, they felt relief having made it that far, and announced they were having a boy!  However during their 20 week ultrasound, the techs were not able to get all the images they needed, so Kelsey and Scott needed to go back in at 24 weeks for a follow up ultrasound.  It was during that appointment that their world came crashing down.  They were told that the baby had a heart defect, and that the baby was measuring almost 4 weeks behind in size.  Those 2 items are symptoms of a couple chromosomal abnormalities, and the specialist told Kelsey and Scott that it was very likely that he had an abnormality that would be fatal.  Most babies are stillborn, and if they do happen to make it to term, they dont survive long outside the womb.  Kelsey and Scott were devastated.  They both wanted nothing more than to be parents, and had been trying for 2 years at this point to make that happen. Doctors ran blood tests that day, and for a week while they waited for the results, they thought their dreams of this baby were gone.  However those results ended up coming back negative/low risk of the 5 most common abnormalities.  Kelsey and Scott's dreams were reignited.  Doctors determined Kelsey's placenta was not working like it should, so that was most likely the reason the baby was measuring small.  They then transferred her to Abbott for future tests and appointments. She was told that most growth restricted babies require extra monitoring, and that at some point she could get admitted to the hospital for constant monitoring.  It would help them determine exactly when the right time would be to take the baby out.  The longer they wait, the healthier the baby, but then if they wait too long then the baby could die from lack of blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.  Kelsey continued monitoring for several weeks.  However the weekend of June 1, at 32 weeks, Kelsey wasnt feeling the babies movement as much, so doctors gave her a shot of steriods and told her she will most likely have the baby by 34 weeks. On Monday June 4, doctors decided that it was time Kelsey be admitted to the hospital.  Scott helped get her checked in, and went home that night.  At this point, Scott had been dealing with multiple symptoms over the last several weeks, cough, body aches, fever, joint pain, etc.  He had seen a couple doctors, and had tried a few meds, but nothing had helped, and no one seemed to be sure exactly what was going on.  They thought he had rheumatoid arthritis, all the symptoms fit, and he had an appointment set up for that Wednesday to start treatment.  After Scott left Kelsey on Monday night though, he went home and he was having a hard time breathing, he could not stop coughing, and he even started coughing up blood. He drove himself the the ER in Shakopee, and they did Xrays and thought it was pneumonia.  They decided to transfer him to another hospital to see a lung specialist, they gave him a choice of Methodist or Abbott, and since Kelsey was at Abbott, they transferred him up there.Once he got checked in there, doctors determined he had a rare autoimmune disease called Vasculitis or Wegeners, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. They started his treatment and on Wednesday he felt so much better.  Kelsey was able to visit him a few times a day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On Thursday however, Scott was still not able to get his oxygen levels up and was still having difficulty breathing.  They wanted to try a few procedures to help, including putting him on lung bypass to help give his lungs a break.  Unfortunately during that procedure, Scott suffered cardiac arrest.  They were able to resuscitate him after 45 min, and after a long while they were able to transfer him up to the Cardiac ICU.  Kelsey was able to be with him, but doctors told her they were not able to stop the bleeding into his lungs, and there wasn't anything else they could do.  Scott passed away just after midnight on June 8th, at just 30 years old.Kelsey was still in the hospital for her high risk pregnancy, and after regular monitoring 3 times a day over the weekend, on Tuesday June 12, doctors determined it was time for her baby to meet the world, just 4 days after his daddy had passed away.  Maxley Russell Ferguson was born via csection at 11:56am on June 12, 2018 and he weighed just 2 pounds 4 ounces.  They had warned Scott and Kelsey that the baby would most likely need to be resuscitated after birth and intubated to help him breath, but little Maxley came out crying and never needed anything to help him breath. He is thriving in the NICU and is just cute as a button.  He will be in the NICU for several weeks as he learns to grow and regulate his own temperature, and once he learns to eat consistently, he will be able to go home, though doctors think that will still be closer to his due date at the end of July.  He will still require heart surgery for his heart defect (which they had learned was an AV canal defect) but doctors anticipate that surgery will be when Maxley is about 4-6 months old.What Kelsey is having to deal with right now, no one should have to go through that.  The birth of your child should be the best time of your life, instead, she is having to mourn the loss of her husband, plan a funeral, and care for her preemie baby in the NICU.  That is a lot for any one person to have to deal with. And obviously with the death of a spouse and parent, several financial burdens come with that.  This campaign is here to help my sister with all that comes with raising a child on her own, daycare costs, bills, not to mention the funeral costs that will come, and a new mortgage as Scott and Kelsey had JUST bought a new house in March after renting an apartment for several years, they wanted a home to raise a family in.Please consider donating what you can to help Kelsey and baby Maxley.  We cant take Kelsey's pain away, but we can help prevent additional burdens by helping her financially.Please visit both caring bridge pages for more detailed information for both Scott and baby Maxley. https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/scottrussellferguson https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/babyfergie",656,3.6k,7,616,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

As everyone knows, Eric is just shy of 31 years old, looks like he is in the best health, always has a smile on his face, and has an energy about him that leaves an impression on everyone he meets. At the beginning of the year, Eric started developing pains in his abdomen and back. He started feeling tired and then caught a cold. They called/met with their doctor and got a z-pac for his symptoms. The cold went away. A week later, the pain started again and nausea developed. We thought it was his pancreas or gallbladder. After going to the ER they ran tests and said everything was fine, except a small mass that appeared in his liver that was  about 4 cms. They then met with a liver doctor and decided it would be best to get a biopsy and proceed with a liver resection if in fact it was a tumor while operating. During his surgery, the mass was found to be cancerous and when the doctor went in further he discovered multiple tumors and was diagnosed with Cholangiocarcinoma. The doctor could not resect the tumors due to the severity of it spreading. Eric and Danielle have been married just under 4 years and thought that IVF was their journey, however, God had other plans. While in the hospital recovering from his major surgery; Eric and Danielle found out for the first time in 3 years, that they were going to be parents. This was his first sign of hope to motivate him through his journey!Currently, Danielle and Eric are meeting with a team of doctors to determine the best treatment plan.  Eric needs to begin chemotherapy immediately in hopes to shrink the tumors to give the doctors an opportunity to go back in and resect areas of his liver.

As most of you know, she is a bass player extraordinaire/singer and we started actually by playing ukeleles together as kids in the Philippines, and singing our hearts out (we are Philippine-Amercan). We moved to acoustic guitars, and then electric instruments with a band in high school (Sacramento, the 60's!). That morphed into the band Fanny, and although our paths diverged a few times, neither of us ever stopped playing. I just need to say that Jean is a national treasure in my opinion - few people can play as she does. And sing, while playing bass!When she had her stroke, it was also discovered that she has diabetes (runs in the family). So her care is complicated - she's home now, but needs continued care and physical therapy. The house has needed to be retrofitted ... and so on. Please give when and as you can and let other people know. You might be surprised at who might already know of Jean Millington through her rich musical history - and/or will be delighted to know of how she's already contributed so much to our joy and happiness by playing with so many - both live and on recordings.A new album has just been released with bandmate (and high school pal from our band the Svelts!), Fanny Walked the Earth: that's Jean, me, and Brie Darling - we need to all go out there and play together again!With endless thanks,June Millington*A note to all our friends: Jean's daughter Marita is the stated beneficiary to make it easier to manage the funds you are so gracously and lovingly donating - it's a joint account, to be clear, and all the funds are directed in such a way that Jean is fully involved. So much thanks!*Photo of Jean during a Svelts (our high school all-girl band) photoshoot at Santa Cruz around Spring of 1968. We were living in a band house in Los Altos at the time, playing as much as possible and learning all the time. Some of the songs on our setlist? ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""Spooky."" We did it all! (oh, yes, ""the Letter"" and ""Funky Broadway,"" too - not bad, to cut your teeth on! We loved every minute of our wild, musical freedom.The house where it all started, Portola Way in Sacramento, CA - photo courtesy Tamara Reynolds.At first, we had a bedroom on the first floor with 2 single, metal beds. When we got a transistor radio in there, we started to learn songs on acoustic guitars - those hits of the day were fantastic! (""We'll Sing In the Sunshine"" and ""End of the World"" come to mind). Then, the attic was renovated just enough for me and Jean to move up and into, and with that our world changed - we had privacy! (it had a trapdoor you could pull up ...). We even had full-on band rehearsals up there, with drums! One of the songs? ""Do You Believe in Magic?"" SURE  we did - we were living it! Later, Fanny did gigs with John Sebastian - we're in touch still. Now, THAT's magic.By 1965, we had started our first all-girl band, the Svelts, with drummer Kathie and fellow folksinger (we switched to electric guitars and bass pretty quickly!) Cathy. SO fun and exciting ... from left: Jean, drummer Kathie Terry, June, and singer-guitarist- Cathy Carter.Several personnel changes later, the Svelts included Brie Darling (née Berry) - who quit a year later but kept playing with us off and on anyway! She ended up at with us in Hollywood at our band house Fanny Hill, and after I left the band in '73 played on the very last Fanny album that had Fanny's biggest hit: Jean's song ""Butter Boy."" Talk about a Long and Winding Road! (drummer Alice de Buhr left shortly after I did, and both Brie and guitarist Patti Quatro joined the band - it was with a different producer and record company, but the band definitely, as the saying goes,  played on). 49 years later we were recording as Fanny Walked the Earth at IMA, a non-profit organizaton for women and girls in Goshen, MA! Here, Jean is shown entering the Control Room where her son, Lee, was working as one of the engineers. We were doing vocals for ""Girls on the Road,""  a sort of song diary of the early Svelts days:""Let's go back to where it all began: 17, then we started a band. Lugging our gear up and down the stairs, making so much noise, we didn' really care! Girls on the road, Girls on the Go, doing what we knew was gonna save our souls ... Riding the wave, coming 'round the bend, onece you feel the beat you got to do it again."" That's absolutely ALL true, and I love those lyrics - they're true to the soul and spirit of our times.We had done so many gigs between '65 and '68 that we felt seasoned and confident, ready for anything that came along. After all, we could back up a trailer and set up a PA ourselves! In top photo left: Brie, June, Cathy and Jean pose as the Svelts just after a personnel change - our manager Dick pasted Brie'a head over Kathie's; the band had to go on and we had no money for promo!We always wanted to play!During out first ""International"" tour - the Svelts, that is. We were kind of having a hard time as Brie quit the band just before we were to set off, and we had no real drummer - here, in Winnipeg, we followed a topless band called ""8 of a Kind,"" who had four band members. I think everyone was so excited at the thought of another topless band (we were not:)) that they barely noticed we were missing a drummer - Jean and Addie Clement, who was also in the Svelts for years (she tore it up on lead guitar and vocals) in their hotel room, in the doldrums. What was gonna happen? This was around July 1967.The Svelts, late Spring 1968 - our house in Los Altos. A nice moment, from left: Wendy Haas (keyboards/vocal), Jean, Brie, and June. Photo by Steve Griffith, thank you.The Svelts, late summer 1968 - nothing would stop us! By now, we'd magically  morphed into the group Wild Honey. In tree,  from left: Alice de Buhr, drums; Jean, bass/vocals ; Wendy, keyboards/vocals; June, rhythm guitar/vocals; and Addie Clement, lead guitar/vocals.Hollywood, finally! We got our record deal in the Fall of '68 with Richard Perry, producer/Reprise Records, and loved our house just above Sunset Strip (dig the landlord's castle, just beyond, complete with courtyard). Who cared about the smog? We promptly scoured the floors, cleaned the basement, installed lava lamps and candles down there with our equipment as a rehearsal lair, and named the house Fanny Hill - as soon as we re-named the band Fanny, which didn't take long. It was a girl's name, and we were gonna conquer the world!

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoLvdnToHMgA portion from my audiobook ""Land of a Thousand bridges,"" my autobiography. Here, I'm going to UC Davis'66-'67, in a band and learning theory for the first time.Ah well, for some reason I can't get that clip to play, but you got the link! Here's our very first busness card, created by the boy who sat in front of me in biology class at McClatchy High in Sacramento, where we'd moved from Manila in 1961. I wish I remembered his name!p.s. the best compliment we got back in those days was ""Not bad for chicks!"" We just smiled and dug in harder ...I love this shot - we literally climbed outside the back windows at Fanny Hill (it had been Hedy Lamar's house - believe me, electric! (look her up as an inventor) ...One of our very early rehearsals in the Fanny Hill living room - Jean bass, Alice de Buhr drums, June guitar. The doors behind us opened up to the porch that overlooked Sunset Strip just beyond. (this would be circa 1969).We would play our hearts out, anytime day or night. Here, we're tightening up an arrangement before heading down to the Whiskey a Go-go (not far from Fanny Hill, maybe 15 blocks down the strip) to play that night. From left: Nicky, Jean, Alice and June.When Nicky Barclay joined the band, pretty soon we were joined by piano and a B-3 organ. Our sound just kept getting bigger and bigger!As we hit the road in 1971, press was as important as people hearing us on records. Next: for them to hear and see us LIVE. Promotion was handled by Derek Taylor,  press officer to the Beatles who was at the time on leave and mostly in LA. He was for a time known as the ""Fifth Beatle,"" and I wouldn't argue with that. Truly one of the most iconic and magical people I ever met. (June)We did it all! Look Magazine, and ironic that we're looking through bars. We needed to bust through! From left: Jean, Alice, Nicky, and June.Jean practicing backstage at the BBC set for the Old Grey Whistle test, Dec 1971. We did the song ""You're the One,"" and people went crazy - even today, the reaction is off the charts. No wonder, it's starts with a closeup of Jean on her bass! We always made sure we warmed up before every appearance, whether live or on television. Playing Fanny material is not for wimps!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukOcZ4Tjk0To hear Fanny backing Barbra live on ""Where You Lead,"" pls go to  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGA_Abhvnc - you can hear Jean and me contibuting to the backup vocals at Verse 2: ""whoo-ooh-ooh""s. Definitely the Millington vocal sound!IN THE EARLY DAYS, THE BEST WE HEARD FROM AUDIENCES WAS ""Not bad for Chicks!"" BY THE TIME WE GOT TO PLAYING SCOTLAND, IN 1972, HORDES OF BOYS WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE STAGE CHANTING ""FAN-nny! ""FAN-nny! ""FAN-nny!"" louder & louder. WE HADN'T REALIZED THAT WORD MEANT SOMETHING COMPLETELY IN THEIR WORLD! BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY, AND LAUGHED RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.  AS LONG AS THEY WERE BUYING RECORDS ...More of that vocal sound on Ella Fitzgerald's version of ""Ooh Baby Baby""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pLTQAXx61E - 1969, and not only did we sing on this (with some earlier members of Fanny, which was called Wild Honey at the time), we watched her do the vocal. Early days LA for us, and meeting such an amazing singer, and public figure, who was so humble and real ... was a transcendent experience (we had the same producer, Richard Perry). THAT - is how you learn to record. xxJust as the first Fanny album was getting ready to be released, we did warm-up gigs to the big tours ahead, around LA. Here, at Knottsberry Farm.Jean at far left, mugging with our mom, our brother Richard and me on an outing in the Philippines, sometime in the 50's.40 years later, rehaearsal with our bad the ""Slammin' Babes,"" in Bodega California! Those were fun times. (photo karen Semanek, thank you)Guess who? We spent so much time in airports, finally we just started mugging on the median strips!Jean with Danny Blakkolb, who'd popped by during a break from Vietnam. So, bopping around and going to music stores Hollywood? Heaven. Danny was the bass player in the Psy-kicks, with  whom we did a lot of gigs in Sacramento: same age, different sexes. But we got along just fine! The music was the thing ... hip, hip, Hooray for the innocent '60's! xxIt took a minute to get used to us ...When we got to London in Dec 1971 to record ""Fanny Hill"" at the Beatles' Apple Studio, they would send a limo for us every day. Our lives sure changed!While we were getting our sound and tour chops together,  Reprise/WB assigned us empty movie lot stages in which to rehearse. Here, Alice Jean and Nicky during a break. We got a lot of work done! (Fanny, circa Fall 1970, photo Linda Wolf).Our mom always remained our staunchest supporter!

This has been the recurring question we all want to know. While the Heines have greatly appreciated everyone’s prayers, meals, cards, and healing thoughts, it is now time to move to the next step of helping them financially.Brian, husband to Julie, and father to Mackenzie and Maddie, has always been a vibrant, quick-witted,  full of life, fun man. He knows no strangers.  In mid-January, Brian was leaving for a business trip and slipped on a patch of ice in the airport parking lot. He landed on his back, but luckily was wearing a backpack which broke his fall. Immediately after, Brian started having neck pain and thought it was from the whiplash of his neck during the fall.  Two weeks passed. Brian woke up on a Saturday morning and noticed his walking gait was different.  A quick trip to the Urgent Care showed scans and bloodwork were clear.  The Urgent Care told Brian to call his physician to schedule an MRI.  The next day, Brian's walk didn't improve, so he went to the E.R.at Missouri Baptist. After a 3-hour MRI, the radiologist misdiagnosed the results as cancer that metastasized . Brian was admitted to the hospital.  Brian and Julie were devastated.  Luckily, Brian's sister found information online about how cavernomas (lesions that several of his family members have) are often incorrectly diagnosed as cancer. They immediately informed Brian's nurse of this information and she consulted the doctors. After reviewing the MRI scans again, Brian was correctly diagnosed with familial cavernous malformations. They found 2 cavernous hemagiomas/lesions attached to his spinal cord at C3 and C4 near the brainstem. In order to receive the best care, Brian was transferred to Barnes where the amazing neurosurgeon, Dr. Chicoine, performed surgery. Dr. Chicoine removed 80% of the C4 lesion, but didn’t feel it was safe to operate on the C3 lesion. Unfortunately, post-surgery, the C3 lesion bled and created many challenges for Brian.  He has remained in the ICU since January 29th and has since had several procedures following surgery including a pacemaker, breathing tube, tracheostomy, and feeding tube.  Currently, Julie is on a leave of absence from her teaching job to be by Brian’s side. She is Brian’s biggest cheerleader and advocate. Between the two of them, Brian and Julie have always been there for others organizing benefit trivia nights, securing silent auction donations, and emceeing the events. It is now our turn to give back to them as a family. Brian, the ultimate life of the party, is currently immobile and can only silently mouth words to communicate. They just received word that Brian will begin rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in Denver, which specializes in helping spinal cord patients..  Any gift you can give will greatly help to defer the cost of current and future medical bills, and living expenses. Thank you all in advance, and Let’s Cover Their “Heine”!Follow Brian's journey at:  https://brianheinerecovery.blogspot.com Add your comments on the blog and I will be sure to read them to Brian.  He will love hearing from all of his supporters!",324,952,3,327,5 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,28,Anna Jeter's Transplant Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/anna-jeter039s-transplant-fund,"EXCELSIOR, MN","August 4, 2018","$85,000","$44,140","On July 29th, Anna Jeter and her mother, Laurie, moved from their home in Minnesota to Palo Alto, California, so that Anna could be listed for a lifesaving heart-lung transplant. This is the only option left to Anna, after 19 years of living with Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). PH is a progressive and terminal illness that impacts both the lungs and the heart, growing more severe with time. Despite a daunting prognosis at the age of four, Anna was responsive to intravenous therapies, which are delivered directly to her heart through a central line 24/7. Although her health has instilled many significant limits upon her life, Anna’s days have been filled with faith, wonder, and community. After finishing high school, Anna’s illness continued to progress, and it became clear that her medications would no longer be enough to sustain her long term. At this time, she was accepted as a candidate for heart-lung transplant at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Without knowing what would come next, Anna began college and continued to push forward. Through four years of hard work and frequent doctor’s visits with her transplant team, Anna was able to graduate in 2017 with a nursing degree from Bethel University. Since finishing college last year, Anna’s health has continued to decline. After a full year spent developing a plan of care with her transplant team, Anna and her family have decided that her best chance for organs is at Stanford Medical center, in California. Now that Anna is listed at Stanford, it is unknown how long she will have to wait for the right match. In this time before surgery, Anna and her family are facing months of many overwhelming financial burdens, including rent and medical costs associated with care prior to transplant. After surgery, the financial pressure will only increase as they face the cost of hospital bills, many new medications, flights for family members so that relief support can be provided, and additional assistance for Anna so that she may lead an independent and productive life as she recovers in the year following transplant. ANY help during this time is incredibly appreciated. Unfortunately, transplant is not a cure-all for Anna’s condition. While she will no longer be living with PH, she will be a transplant patient for the rest of her life. This will bring forth a whole new set of risks and concerns. With that said, Anna’s new organs will allow her to live life in a new way. Her physical endurance will hopefully be greatly improved, so that Anna will be able to travel, hike, and exercise in ways that have never been an option to her in the past 19 years. Ultimately, Anna and her family are optimistic about the second chance at life that a heart-lung transplant could provide.Despite the chaos of this year, Anna’s faith in God throughout this process is unwavering, and she is fortified to know that He is walking with her always. If you are not able to contribute financially, please know that prayer is just as precious to Anna and her family in this season. Please lift her name up, and please share her story so that she can continue to be an outlet of light and hope for others. While Anna has been unable to begin pursuing a career as a nurse, she has instead chosen to push towards her calling as an artist and a writer. If you are looking for another way to support Anna, her artwork can be found for purchase on her website ( www.annalisabeth.co), or at GOLDEN RULE in Excelsior, MN.",197,1.6k,2,191,29 days,13 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Before her diagnosis in January 2017, she was busy helping her four sons - who range in ages from 14 to 6 pursue an Eagle Scout rank, navigate the wonders of boyhood and even prepare for kindergarten. She did all this while working as a full-time editor. Kendra has undergone radiation, chemotherapy and is now receiving an infusion treatment, along with antibiotics to work against her aggressive form of cancer. Her treatment was paused recently due to unexplained infections which brought on high fevers. The complications haven’t stopped with the physical. There are new financial concerns and worries about ongoing hospital stays to manage her everyday care and recovery. You would never guess this because Kendra’s smile continues to light up any room. This Texas native keeps her dry wit even on the darkest days. Kendra is as strong as she is funny. Her faith defines her. While in her early twenties, Kendra was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission when she met her future husband Travis.  After 15-plus years of marriage, Kendra and Travis have a steady partnership and continue to be everyone’s favorite couple to be around whether on the ballfield cheering on one of the boys or sitting in the audience of a school play. Kendra and Travis, who served in the US Air Force, have lived in Northern Virginia since 2000. Kendra inspires many of us - not only by how bravely and fiercely she’s fighting cancer for the second time, but also for the loving, accepting Christian she is in everyday life, for the fun and playful mom she is to four active and kind boys, for the devoted and caring daughter, sister, friend and wife she is. Care for Kendra has a goal of raising $50,000 to help with Kendra’s medical and related expenses. With questions swirling about Kendra’s infections, insurance coverage, and potential surgeries in her future, Kendra faces many unknowns. Please join us in caring for her by whatever means you feel led. You may offer financial support of any amount or give the gift of prayer or both. Whatever you do, please help spread the word on your Facebook page, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and any other venues at your fingertips. Thank you in advance.

Craig HospitalAttn: Rio Peterson Room #4033425 South Clarkson StreetEnglewood CO. 80113-----------------------------------------------------------------------Update Sunday, May 6th, 2018KREM 2 out of Spokane, Washington has shared Rio's story. That story can be found heree: https://www.krem.com/article/news/local/cda-nurse-runs-bloomsday-in-solidarity-for-friend-with-spinal-cord-injury/293-549375307Rio PetersonPlease Help Rio Continue His Care at Craig Hospital#RioStrong Riostrong.com

On April 16 th, Rio was skiing Squaw Mountain in Lake Tahoe where he suffered a spinal cord injury, fracturing C5 and C6 vertebrae’s in his neck. Rio was transported to Renown Medical Center in Reno and underwent spinal surgery followed by 9 days in the ICU. Through donations and many helping hands, Rio was medically transported to Craig Rehab Hospital in Denver, CO for intense rehabilitation. At this point Rio has movement in his right arm, limited in his left arm and is working on weaning off the ventilator. Because the injury is new, we’re praying for great strides to be made during his rehabilitation. Prior to Rio’s accident he was working as a travel nurse. Rio was not content performing required nursing duties and strived to raise the bar. Outside of work he often helped the less fortunate in the community. The stories of his kindness have been overwhelming. Although he would deny it, his kind heart has touched many people.We are now asking for your generosity to allow Rio continued care at Craig Hospital. During his rehabilitation, Craig will aggressively work with himphysically and psychologically. He does have insurance, but as most know, that only goes so far. Rio’s greatest chance at regaining physical function and generalhealth is to stay at Craig Hospital for one year. Rio’s insurance will cover only minimal physical and occupational therapy.

He tries with everything he has to get his body moving. Today they will do a swallow evaluation. We need his nasal tube out so he can be transported. That tube is feeding him now. We give him full body massage 2 x’s a day, pray around him and do a lot of energy work. He loves to read his email & text msgs. He’s on top of his care - he knows every med he’s given (the 5 rights- nursing language). He’s requested a lot of alternative treatments and herbs to reduce inflammation, promote stomach health and nerve pain - of course he gets turned down. No problem if he wants oxycodone or morphine, but god forbid if he wants B12. He cried and cried when he saw gofundme. He said “people are good”. The most amazing thing is that it will get him transported to Denver! Thank you, thank you! We’ll know more tomorrow when that will happen. Please, please keep praying for Rios lungs to start breathing on their own and we’ll set our goal higher after that one! #Riostrong. We love you all!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------Update #2 from Saturday, April 21st,I just got off the phone with Tawni, and my good friend Rio. How encouraging that was. Today hasn't been easy, but they're staying incredibly strong during the ""push through,"" and pushing through, they are. Rio has very much enjoyed the text messages that everyone has been sending him. He has his phone propped up in an area where he is able to read them. Please continue to send him your love and text messages. It helps to get him through.Rio's phone number is 208-899-9312. Please share it with his friends.---------------------------------------------------------Update from GoFundMe, Saturday April 21st.(Please see Tawni's latest update from Yesterday below this update)

This is amazing.  Rio's campaign has been noticed and is now under verification review by GoFundMe. This doesn't affect anything, they're just working on some details on the backend for verification purposes.

The verification review comes because of the tremendous love, support, and backing you have shown towards Rio.  There are many thousands of GoFundMe's that get created everyday, however they don't typically get this kind massive notice. GoFundMe has specifically recognized this.  Rio, and the Peterson Family have clearly made a massive impact on us all.

As part of the verification process GoFundMe has asked me to clarify a few things.

First, my name is Tony Agenbroad from Nampa, ID.  I still drive by the Peterson's old Nampa house everyday.  The house is looking great guys.I'm Radley's age, and grew up with the boys, and the Peterson family.  From elementary school, church, 4H pigs, ski trips, camping trips, college and beyond, I've been blessed to have been able to spend so much quality time with the Peterson Family.The funds from this campaign will be used to medically transfer Rio from Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV, to Craig Institute in Denver, CO.  Craig specializes in spinal chord trauma and rehabilitation.  It's where the magic happens.  Tawni has said that it is vital that we get him there. Denver is over 1,000 miles away from Reno. 

We will work with Hobie and Tawni, Rio's parents, as a part of securing the funds.  Words cannot thank everyone so much for your love and support.  Please stay strong. We know you will.Let's get Rio to Denver.

#RioStrong

-----------------------------------------------------Update from Tawni, Friday, April 20thHere we are on day 4. A bit of a roller coaster with more ups then downs. The High 5 foundation that supports injured athletes came in and met with Rio/us yesterday. It gave us the boost we needed. Rio’s intubation tube was removed and he was given a Trach for ventilation breathing. That’s given him tons of comfort plus we’re becoming good at lip reading. Tuesday he acquired ventilator pneumonia so he’s currently fighting that. A representative from Craig Rehab hospital is flying in Monday to meet with us. Because of the gofundme donations Rio has received, he’s got some money to be medically transported. It’s incredible to think this is becoming a reality. He could be transported as early as next week to their vent unit. Please pray that Rio comes off the vent and his lungs start working on their own. We’ll move on from there— baby steps! In the meantime, every person that comes to his room has to hug him, he thanks everyone and often will mouth, “you the man”. Continue to send the positive thoughts and prayers. We need them more now than ever.------------------------------------------------------------Update from Thursday, April 19th.Thank you SO very much to all of you, and the incredible amount of support EVERYONE has shown.  The Petersons can feel it, and it's positive energy like this that will make all the difference. Right now a priority is to get Rio to Craig Institute in Denver, CO. Craig Institute specializes in Spinal Chord injury.  It is the place Where the Magic Happens. It will not be easy to get Rio to Craig.Rio has some movement and sensation in his upper body.  He has some ability to move his arms, and we hope and pray that this will continue to improve. This is amazing progress so far.He is aware of the love of his family and friends that surround him, even from many miles away.  He is in good spirits, even sharing some ""brotherly love"" with Radley and Rabon, who have both made it down to Reno.Rio's accident happened on Monday, at Squaw Valley Ski Resort.  He was then transported to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV. Right now, Rio's mailing address is: Renown Medical Center, C/O Rio Peterson1155 Mill St. Reno, NV 89502 Rio PetersonSierra Intensive Care Unit Rm 110Throughout this week I (Tony), was approached by many different people talking about this campaign.  Everyone approached me saying the same thing. Everyone is saying ""It's crazy that the campaign is getting this kind of traction! With that though, I'm not surprised because Rio and The Peterson's are such great people."" I too am not surprised by the overwhelming support.  You all have been great.Please continue to share what you can and send your positive thoughts.  Let's get him to Denver, and let this Magic Happen.With much love, on behalf of The Peterson's -- thank you, everyone.-----------------------------------------------------------------Post from Monday, April 16thStarting a GoFundMe with some bad, yet hopeful news.

Our good friend Rio Peterson was in a skiing accident today, and has a spinal injury.  He fractured his C5-6 vertebrae, and what happens this  next week will be crucial to his healing.

The Peterson family is the most humble, and positive, family I know.  I've always felt their support, and I know there are a lot of us who can say the same.

We are raising funds for the Peterson family to be with Rio.  Please contribute what you can, and please always keep your thoughts positive.  Prayers for Rio",406,1.5k,0,422,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The newlyweds planned to enjoy their honeymoon in Spain a few days after their vows; however, their plans were interrupted due to an unexplainable and excruciating pain in Yelena’s left leg. Instead of a honeymoon, the couple visited the hospital several times with an unsuccessful diagnosis of her condition. Six days after her wedding, Yelena was unable to move her left leg, so Alfredo and Yelena’s mother drove her to the emergency room. Within hours of arriving at the emergency room, doctors discovered Necrotizing Fasciitis a flesh eating bacteria rapidly advancing through her leg.  An amputation was the only option to rid her body of the infection. This infection can be deadly, so immediate action had to be taken to save Yelena’s life. Newlyweds, Yelena and Alfredo, were not prepared for a tragedy like this. Yelena will need a prosthetic leg and intensive rehabilitative therapy, so she can live her life like she did before this tragedy. A marriage should not start with such a tragic experience and unexpected medical bills.  Yelena loves to dance, so we are hoping she can go straight to dancing soon after her recovery. Yelena is disciplined, dedicated, and determined. When she wants something, she goes after it. We know that with her loving husband, Alfredo, and all of us by her side, Yelena will come out of this situation stronger than ever before, and she WILL DANCE AGAIN!!!!!",230,709,15,241,4 months,29 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

The bills have begun rolling in and the family will be financially responsible for  long-term care within a week or so. (Fun fact: private helicopter rides are billed at $30,000!!!)  Any donations received will assist in the payment for treatment, any related costs incurred, and the upkeep of the Lichtenberger household.  Our family greatly appreciates any help you are able to give.  Keep praying for Carol, please, and we wish everyone peace and love.",193,290,0,198,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Needless to say, it has the possibility of affecting every organ in his body at any moment.  The care plan includes immediate and aggressive treatment with chemotherapy starting this Thursday, March 15th, 2018.  Art is presently battling high fevers and feeling very physically weak, not to mention emotionally and mentally drained about how his life has just been turned upside down.  He is overwhelmed beyond anything any of us can imagine after receiving such a devastating diagnosis.  If you know Art, you know him to be strong, funny, caring, and one of the most generous people you have ever met.  He is a doting dad to his twin daughters, Alyssa and Kalynn.  He is the eldest son of Auntie Rose and Uncle Art, protective older brother to Ryan and Lisa, and a great cousin and friend to so many people.  If you have ever heard of, or eaten at GrubShack in San Jose, you have most likely run into or spoken to him. To help Art during his time of need, we have set up this GoFundMe fundraising page and ask all those who know and care about Art to please pray hard for him, and if you are able, please donate any amount, big or small.  It will help greatly with enormous medical care and treatment costs not covered by insurance, living expenses, and various bills while Art's ability to work is indefinitely put on hold.We thank you all very much for taking the time to read about Art's situation.  Our ""Doctolero Ohana"" will continue to do our best to care for him, and with your help, it will certainly alleviate his mental anguish due to anticipated financial costs.   Your help and support will allow him to focus on getting through the chemo treatments, healing quickly, staying positive, and fighting his cancer to get back to a normal, healthy life.Thank you very much in advance.  We hope your generosity will come back to you tenfold!Warmest Regards,The Doctolero FamilyArt has authorized his aunt, Lita Doctolero-Tang, to manage the donation withdrawals from this fundraising campaign into a beneficiary bank account especially set up for Art.",245,1.2k,4,207,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Scoliosis is a disorder that causes an abnormal curve of the spine, or backbone and Ava’s curve was measured at 65 degrees. Because she is only 10 years old, there is great concern that the curve will continue to advance as she goes through puberty, resulting in alifelong disfigurement in her spine, discomfort and potential impacts on her lungs.Since being diagnosed, Ava has undergone a series of weekly                      non-surgical treatments, including a 2 week intensive care program in Orlando Florida over her Christmas Break. She has also been outfitted with a corrective brace that she currently wears 22 hours each day. Ava has traveled to the Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, as well as,several medical facilities in Georgia and Florida in search of the best treatment options going forward. To this point, health insurance hasnot covered any of Ava’s treatments and all expenses for treatment and travel have been paid out of pocket, creating a financial burden for the family.Looking ahead, Nemours Childrens Hospital in Jacksonville Florida offers a surgical procedure known a Vertebral Body Tethering that helps correct Scoliosis while still allowing for normal growth andflexibility of her spine. She has been scheduled for surgery May 9th.At this time the family is unsure how much their financial responsibilities will be for surgery and recovery but the current out of pocket costs for her treatments and pre-operative care are $25,000.Thank you in advance for your donations to help cover these costs and get Ava Grace on the road to recovery.Added by Jennifer to update for gofundme to be used correctly:

Medical,29,Penny and Orrin Freeman,https://www.gofundme.com/penny-and-orrin-freeman,"LOS ANGELES, CA","May 31, 2018","$20,000","$43,295","Family and friends, asking for help is incredibly difficult, but my mom and her husband, Penny and Orrin Freeman, are in need. Your contributions will go directly to ensuring that Orrin receives the care he needs to recover from a series of spinal infections that have caused him to lose the ability to walk, and for my Mom to be able to provide for his care while she undergoes chemotherapy for Stage 3 colon cancer. Mom and OrrinMom and Orrin met while they were both students at USC in the early 1970s. Orrin was a baseball player, and Mom was a musical theater actress in the theater program. While at USC, Orrin helped the team to 4 national championships, and is currently in the USC sports program hall of fame. Mom performed in numerous productions while at USC, including the West Coast premiere of The Who’s rock opera Tommy. After college, Orrin became a baseball coach. He coached at UC Santa Barbara, San Francisco State, and Sonoma State, before becoming a scout for the MLB. Orrin joined the Florida Marlins as a scout at the team’s inception in 1991 and has been with the team ever since. In his 27 years as a member of the Marlin’s franchise, he has helped the team win two world series titles and, in 2014, was awarded both Scout of the Year by Major League Baseball and received a lifetime achievement award from the Major League Baseball Scouting Association.After college, Mom graduated from law school and earned her Masters degree in Education and School Administration. She taught elementary school for 25 years in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and also became a Vice Principal and Principal at several schools before retiring in 2007. She continued to act and sing, performing with the Riverside Master Chorale, the Redlands Footlighters, the Riverside Community Theater, and many other productions.30 years after dating while at USC, Mom and Orrin reconnected, and were married in 2007.OrrinIn January of 2018, mom found Orrin incapacitated in his armchair. A lifelong diabetic, Orrin’s blood pressure had spiked and metastasized into a bacterial infection in his spine. He was hospitalized and intubated into a medical coma. Doctor’s found that he was too ill to receive an operation that would have given him a good chance of walking again, and in the meantime his insurance kept moving him from facility to facility. He can only be transported via medical transport (ambulance), and has been moved between the hospital, Skilled Nursing Facilities, and Assisted Living Facilities since January. His insurance also had him discharged from his Skilled Nursing Facility, determining that he was not making sufficient progress towards recovery due to “a possible problem with his brain”.Additionally, Orrin faces a difficult decision: he can undergo a full back reconstructive surgery due to the extensive damage done to his back by infection.  This is incredibly risky, but, if successful, would give him a much better change of walking again. If it fails, it would leave him in extensive pain without regaining the ability to walk. The other option is a spinal fusion procedure, which would potentially greatly reduce the amount of pain he is in, but would likely confine him to a wheelchair. Because of his condition, we are unsure whether or not Orrin will be able to return to work. Though he has been in Major League Baseball since 1982 and is entitled to a pension upon retirement, he must work until he is 70 to receive his full pension. He is currently 68 and a half, and may never work again, so while he is able to draw from his pension, he must do so at -48% what he would have received if he’d worked until the retirement age of 70. MomMy mom, Penny Freeman, has been Orrin’s caregiver and advocate since the day he entered the hospital. She’s there nearly every day, making arrangements, ensuring he’s attended to, and arranging his transportation to and from doctor’s appointments and various facilities via ambulance. In March 2018, that all changed.In March 2018, Mom was hospitalized in need of a blood transfusion. Though the transfusion initially helped, a couple weeks later she was hospitalized a second time. A diagnostic revealed that she had Stage 3 Colon Cancer, and though she had surgery to remove the cancerous growth in the colon, a biopsy revealed that the cancer had spread and she would need to undergo chemotherapy. She starts chemo on June 5th, and will have to be infused every two weeks until November. While her oncologist is confident that the chemotherapy will eradicate her cancer, the chemo itself will weaken her body and seriously lower her ability to fight off sickness and infection during the 5 months of treatment.While doctors had initially thought they had the infection under control, a recent test revealed that Orrin has a resurgence of infection in his spine. Because chemotherapy will drastically compromise her immune system, she is not allowed to be near Orrin until the infection is under control, meaning she cannot accompany him to doctor’s appointments.The NeedOrrin has exhausted his skilled nursing benefit through his insurance plan, so last month they had to pay $13,000 cash for him to be cared for. Because Mom is not allowed to be near Orrin while her immune system is compromised, he has been moved to an assisted living facility at a rate of nearly $6,000 a month. Because he is not able to ambulate or walk, or even sit up without intense pain, he has to be transported to and from doctor's appointments via ambulance, and since mom cannot accompany him, they must also pay someone to accompany him to and from doctor's appointments, all of this also out of pocket.

Medical,29,Help Teresa with brain cancer ,https://www.gofundme.com/help-7-year-old-teresa-beat-cancer,"SELLERSVILLE, PA","March 5, 2018","$50,000","$43,124","Teresa Sensinger of Perkasie, PA, daughter of Andrew and Michelle Sensinger is battling brain cancer. The family is requesting donations to help with mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses. Please read Teresa’s story below:Early in May of 2017, Teresa Sensinger was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She underwent surgery but due to the tumor’s location, total removal was not possible. From there, Teresa underwent vigorous physical therapy along with high dose chemo and radiation therapies. Her surgery had left her with some physical deficits, but her positive spirit was unwavering. By August, Teresa was able to come home from the hospital just in time to celebrate her seventh birthday with family and friends. Through the summer and fall, her doctors continued with the most aggressive treatment options possible to prevent the reoccurrence and spread of the cancer cells. Unfortunately, by fall of 2017, the doctors found that the tumors had returned. Through the help of the “Make-A- Wish Foundation”, Teresa was able to walk the beautiful beaches of Florida, visit Sea World, Disney, the Kennedy Space Center, and visit with family in Georgia.After returning home from her trip, Teresa continued with her chemo treatments. In January, a follow up scan revealed several new tumors extending down her spine. Her doctors determined that as aggressive as the chemo was, it just wasn’t working. The medical team decided to discontinue the chemo, and began a palliative course of radiation. Teresa completed this last course of treatment on February 20th, but was readmitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) just two days later with nausea and uncontrollable headaches. Her doctors have worked tirelessly searching for treatment options to give her relief. At that time, Teresa was experiencing severe balance deficits and had lost most of her hearing, and later her ability to speak, but the hope was that these were side effects of the radiation and would subside with time.This past Friday, Teresa’s parents, Andrew and Michelle, sat down with their team of doctors and received the worst news any parent could imagine. The latest scan showed the tumor had now wrapped around Teresa’s brain stem and there was nothing more they could do. This coming Tuesday, the hospital will be transporting her back home under hospice care, where she can be surrounded by her family and loved ones. Due to mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses not all covered by insurance, the family is requesting donations to alleviate the financial burden on Andrew and Michelle. Remember, every little bit helps and no contribution is too small as we read in Mark 12: 41-44.The family also requests your prayers during this difficult time. All donations will be given to the Sensinger family, Michelle and Andrew.￼￼￼￼￼￼",652,3.0k,17,673,6 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have Secondary Progressive MS, which is an aggressive form of the disease where I am able to enjoy some periods of relief and partial recoveries. Five years ago my friends got together to raise money for an alternative oxygenation treatment in Guayaquil.  I  was blown away by the love and support that I received from friends all across the globe that in many cases I hadn’t spoken to in years.  It was so uplifting and a huge motivation for me and I am forever grateful.  I will never be able to express how truly therapeutic the support and love was for me in that very dark time of my life.The oxygenation treatment was initially a success. I experienced an incredible improvement in mobility of my limbs, especially in my left side which is the side most affected by the disease.   A short time after the treatment was complete, however, I suffered a very strong relapse.  The journey since has been a difficult one.  I have alternated between alternative and traditional medicine and treatments. Although I have experienced some improvements from time to time, generally they were always followed by strong relapses and eventually I have ended up primarily in a wheel chair with very little mobility in my legs.  This past September it became increasingly difficult to do things on my own, it got to a point where I needed help doing everything including going to the bathroom.  I’ve learned how horrible it is to have to depend completely on people to help me even in the simplest of tasks.  At the beginning of this year I started seeing a Bio Energetic doctor.  Through his treatments, which include neural therapy, homeopathy, acupuncture, magnetic therapy as well as brain training we have managed to not only stabilize my regression but I have also regained a lot of energy and mobility to the point where I am once again able to restore some of my independence and do things on my own.  For the first time in a long time I have hope again.  I believe God has given me a second chance of life.I would like to continue the treatments with my current doctor which are helping me so much.  Unfortunately the situation in Ecuador is very difficult and health insurance doesn’t cover alternative treatments .  So I am here humbly asking for your support again.   Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated and if you cannot help, please don’t feel bad.  I appreciate your love and support just as much.  I am hoping as I get better that I will be able to make it to Miami and even NY and hope to see you all soon. With love,Reg",114,269,2,115,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Thank you. It means so much.Others have asked if they can still assist. Because things happened so quickly they didn't have time to respond. All I can say is we are walking a road we've never traveled and costs may exceed what we might have imagined. This surgery will cost over a million dollars.  We are thankful for insurance, however he will need to meet deductables, co-pays, etc, not covered by insurance. My father's post surgery meds may range from 5-9k a month (insurance covers up to 70%).  Whatever he receives in donations will be helping out immensely.______________David, has had a persistent cough. In the fall of 2016 it worsened noticeably. Justifiably concerned, he took his concern to a litany of doctors to ascertain the issue. The search came to an end in late November with a difficult diagnosis. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis was the cause. This condition is terminable. The only hope for survival, with any quality of life was to qualify for and undergo surgery for a lung transplant. Our family was, and is, stunned.With this devastating news,  we began to research in order to determine the best place to receive the transplant. The answer was the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. David began the work of getting on the list. Without going into detail suffice it to say this is an arduous task. The encouraging news is that he has now finally been put on the transplant list for both the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pittsburg Hospital.And that is what leads to my request for your help.You see our family lives in Coral Springs, Florida and while insurance pays for much of the medical costs many of our needs are formidable and out of pocket. We will need to establish a temporary residence near these cities. We hope to be able to travel from our full-time home to spend time as caregivers for our dad. Someone must be with him 24 hours a day. He is now on oxygen around the clock. Medication costs that are not covered by insurance are beginning to add up. Even after the procedure is completed it is required to stay close to the hospital in case of complications. He will be enrolled in a pulmonary rehab for two months following the surgery. This cost, too, is not covered by any insurance. We will live near the hospital part time and commute to our home part time. Obviously, this has altered our existence and placed extensive hardship on our family. But with grace we will survive. Together,  we will have it covered, will get it done, and pour our best into this as one family team.Would you be willing to help us through this medical crisis by providing a financial contribution to assist us with lodging and transportation during this season? When all is said and done we estimate it will cost somewhere around $26,000 to meet these expenses. It seems formidable, but we hold onto hope for the future.  Any gift would be greatly appreciated. Join our team. With many on the team, we are confident we can pull through. Thank you so much for your consideration. We will keep you posted about the progress as we move forward.This page was created by Ericka Underwood, the eldest daughter of David Underwood. Donations will cover:1.

He was having a lovely day with family at the beach in Florida, playing with his nephew in the water, when he was rolled by an unexpectedly large wave. He must have hit his head extremely hard and lost consciousness, we are not sure for how long. His nephew pulled him from the water and his father gave him CPR to pump seawater and sand from his lungs. He has been unable to breathe unassisted since then and we’re uncertain if he gained consciousness although it’s possible he did open his eyes at some point before going to the ER. He was rushed to the ER as a near-drowning victim where they discovered he had several fractured vertebrae. He is currently in a medically induced coma and has been in surgery for 8 hours. Information we have:His C1 and C7 vertebrae are fractured, C4 broke into the spinal cord, C2 is shattered, there may be skull fractures, and the spinal cord is severed. The surgery (expected to be over 8 hours long) is intended to prevent further damage and Don will be kept in a medically induced coma for an undetermined amount of time to try to promote as much healing as possible. Doctors are not yet sure of brain activity or possible damage, partly because they do not know how long he was unconscious underwater. They think maybe as long as 4 minutes. The prognosis is that the spinal cord cannot be mended so the best-case scenario has Don being a quadriplegic which would be irreversible. The next challenge for him to overcome will be to see if he can breathe on his own, which is unknown at this time. It could be as long as several weeks while Don is in a coma before anyone knows whether or not he can breathe without a ventilator.As you can imagine this is a devastating time for both Donald and Kelly, she’s a warrior for sure but the scenario is taxing all of her resources emotionally and financially. She has just left for Florida to be with Don and his family.

For those of you who know both Krist and Tasha, know that this time has been very challenging for them. They need our help. Krist was diagnosed in  April 2017 with a rare type of cancer; Ampula Of Vater. A tumor growing on his ampula blocked the common bile duct. Krist went in for a Whipple Procedure 3 weeks after his diagnosis to remove the tumor and then started a very difficult chemotherapy treatment from June 2017 through September. In September, Krist got very sick from a blood infection so the doctors decided to stop the chemotherapy as they knew it would be too hard on his body during that time. While Krist had been battling this blood infection, Tasha went in for an MRI that month upon finding a lump in her breast. Tasha was diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. The doctors opted for a double mastectomy, 8 chemo treatments and 28 radiation treatments. Just 5 months later, in Feb 2018, it was found that Krist’s cancer had metastasized to his liver. He went through more chemotherapy that went through the end of June 2018. The doctors said at that point that they have exhausted chemotherapy options at the facility. They suggested that he be a part of a trial at the University of Chicago of Medicine. During that same week they went to the Block Center for another opinion for treatment for both hormone replacement therapy for Tasha and other medical options for Krist. The day after the appointment at the Block Center, Krist ended up in the hospital with jaundice. He needs to get his bilirubin numbers down and figure out what the next steps are. 

Over the last year combined, Tasha and Krist have been indebted with medical bills. Please help this beautiful family. There is no amount too small. Every little bit will help take the financial stress off their plates while they continue to get treatment. Please keep this beautiful family in your prayers.

Not only did he have leukemia, but he learned at just 23 years old, that he had two types of leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since that day he has beaten all odds to be here with us today. He has had a bone marrow transplant, hip replacement, neurological issues and countless other trials. Any complication and side effect that could come from the transplant, chemo, medications, etc., it seemed like Tripp would fall victim. Today is no different. His current battle is due to Graft vs. Host Disease of the lungs.  Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD) of the lungs is caused by the new blood cells in his body, from the bone marrow transplant (the graft), attacking his lungs (the host).  GVHD can usually be controlled with different medicines, but in his case, the damage to his lungs was too severe before it was brought under control.   This caused irreparable damage to his lungs.  Despite many treatment plans, he is now at the point of requiring a double lung transplant.  Due to Tripp’s medical history caused by the leukemia and complications related to treating that disease, there are a limited number of facilities that would even consider him for transplant.  Duke University Hospital is the largest lung transplant program in the Southeast taking on more difficult cases like Tripp’s.  

Over 4 and half years ago, I saw my dad cry for the first time. I am starting this GoFundMe page to help four of the most important people in my life: my brother, my mother, my father, and my brother’s fiancé, Christine. In just a few weeks, my brother, mother (as his required caretaker), and Christine are temporarily relocating to Durham, North Carolina so Tripp can start the lung transplant program at Duke University Hospital. They will be in Durham for up to one year while Tripp receives and then heals from his lung transplant.  Although Tripp does have medical insurance, it doesn’t cover all the medical attention and therapy he will require pre-transplant and post-transplant. They will also have relocation, rent and living expenses for up to one year – none of which are covered by insurance.  This next year will be a very trying time for him, my mother, Christine and my father - as he will have to stay in Florida.

I am asking for your support to help my brother through this difficult time and to reduce the financial stress on my family. Any little bit helps, and we are beyond grateful for any generosity you are willing to give. In addition to any financial generosity, we ask for your prayers. God has already delivered Tripp through more complications than you could imagine. God is faithful and we are trusting in Him.",374,1.2k,0,368,9 days,6 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Back Story 

I had been having chest and back pain for quite a while. In October 2017, I was admitted to the hospital and tests showed a mass in my right lung. 

A biopsy in November showed it was benign. Since it wasn't cancer and surgery to remove it would mean months out of work, we decided to try to shrink the mass with medication. Unfortunately, the pain didn't get better. As the months went by, it got worse and worse. It got to the point where I couldn't sleep and I was coughing up blood. 

In June of this year, I went to St. Luke's emergency room and was admitted for many, many tests. My pet scan showed ""activity"" in two different areas of my lung, plus a muscle under my ribcage. Alarmingly, the original mass had grown a great deal in a short time. Doctors performed multiple biopsies. 

Diagnosis 

On July 9, my wife and I were given news that shocked us to our core: I have cancer. Spindle cell sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects bone, muscle, and connective tissue. Sarcoma is difficult to treat under the best of circumstances, but when it has spread like mine has, the prognosis is much worse. 

Treatment 

Conventional doctors are recommending chemotherapy to try to shrink the largest mass before removing it and a large portion of my right lung, and then possibly radiation. All of these treatments are expensive and painful. Worse, their success rate against cancer like mine is low. 

A Safer Alternative

I have researched and found a clinic in Mexico that has successfully treated sarcoma using nutritional therapy and other treatments, such as: 
*Oxygen therapy 
*Rife therapy 
*Biomagnetic therapy 
*Regenerative cell therapy 
*Low-dose chemotherapy 
*Hyperthermia 

Costs 

A 3-week treatment plan at the clinic costs $22,000. However, difficult cases may take 6 weeks or longer to treat. In addition, I won't be able to work during that time. Since I'm self-employed, I won't be getting sick pay or vacation pay, and I'll still have all of the usual household expenses to pay. 

What Your Donation Is Doing (8/21/18)

I have already stayed the initial 3 weeks ($22,000), plus an extra week ($7,300). I was unexpectedly hospitalized for a week (versus the usual outpatient care), which was an additional $2,800. After learning that one of the tumors had grown, we decided to fight it with stem cell/bone marrow treatment, which costs $3,500. Now we are seeing signs that my tumor is dying, but it looks like I will need at least one more week of treatment ($7,300).

How You Can Help 

My journey with this disease has just begun, but with the grace of God and your generosity, I'm determined to beat it. Please donate whatever you can. I understand times are tough for a lot of people, but even $5 will help me get the treatment that can save my life. I'm grateful for every penny. Please help me see my daughters reach adulthood. Help me see my 4 children get married. Help me one day see my grandchildren. 

Help me fight. Help me live. Please share my link  with your family and friends:  https://www.gofundme.com/SamFightsCancer Feel free to post it to Facebook or Twitter.

This was written by her husband Brian and he has graciously allowed me to share it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Moana has had normal allergy type symptoms for several years. She lost her hearing several months ago and eventually was not able to breath out of one of her nostrils. We figured that it was some type of a chronic sinus infection. After receiving antibiotics and it didn't improve Moana's provider sent her in to get a CT scan. After the results came back they asked her to do a biopsy. When the results came back we found out that she has NPC. It is a rare form of cancer here in the United States but is more common in other countries and seem to show up a lot in people that are Chinese. The Dr. put a tube in her ear and now she can hear but still can't breath out of her nostril. But she is so positive that she has been celebrating her hearing returning. We found a few places across the US that perform surgery to remove these tumors. We decided that Stanford would be the right fit for Moana. Once we sent in all of the imaging, we found out that she was not a candidate for surgery because the tumor was too big. However, after going through the process we felt like Stanford was still the right place for her to receive chemotherapy and radiation. We will be meeting with the specialists that will be doing her chemotherapy and radiation next week and will have a much more clear understanding of how long the treatments will last. Based on other patients and estimates, it will most likely be roughly six weeks of radiation everyday Mon-Fri but I'm not sure yet how often and when she will receive the chemotherapy treatments. Stanford will be a little far from home and it isn't the most convenient place to get in and out of but after the research that we did we felt like it was the right place. Logistically, we will figure out how it is all going to come together. Moana has been very upbeat and positive and is really an inspiration to me. She has taken the news well but I know that she is a little scared. The love and support that we have received has been life changing. It completely changes the way that I look at the world.

Medical,31,Love & Prayers for Indigo Rose,https://www.gofundme.com/25f8xjck,"SANTA CLARITA, CA","May 13, 2018","$50,000","$41,674","Three weeks ago, our family got the kind of phone call that everyone dreads. My three-year-old niece was being rushed to the hospital by ambulance. She had suddenly lost control of the entire right side of her body and could not stand on her own. While my terrified sister and brother-in-law, Megan and Rob, rushed with Indigo Rose to the hospital, the rest of us paced by the phone, anxious for news. Indigo had always been healthy, so we were hopeful that nothing could be seriously wrong.When Megan called, however, the news was bad. Indigo had had a stroke, and the doctors didn't know why. For days, she had to undergo test after test, from bloodwork to EEGs to MRIs and MRAs. She had another stroke two days later, where she was paralyzed on one side of her body again. She had to have so many tests that the doctors had to insert a PICC line that goes from the veins in her arm to her heart to make blood draws and medicine easier to administer.After a few more days, the doctors had some answers for us. They diagnosed Indigo with Moyamoya, which is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder. She is at Stage 4, whereas other children diagnosed at her age are generally Stage 1 or 2. Moyamoya causes the  arteries at the base of her brain grow narrower and narrower over time, leading to strokes, muscular weakness, seizures, and, without medical intervention, death. The pediatric neurosurgeons at UCLA recommended bilateral revascularization surgery, which bypasses her blocked arteries,  as the only way to  save Indigo's life.Last week, Indigo underwent the surgery. While the plan was to work on both sides of her brain, the neurosurgeons realized mid-surgery that Indigo's brain was hemorrhaging, and so she was too weak to have the operation on both sides. They spent 6 hours working on the left side of her brain, and they will have to repeat the surgery on the right side of her brain in another 6 months. She woke up from the surgery in extreme pain, and her little face was swollen and bruised.Although the surgery was nerve-wracking for everyone, especially Megan and Rob, we thought that maybe the worst was over. It wasn't. During the night after the surgery, Indigo suffered another stroke. The following night, she started having seizures, one of which lasted more than three hours. That seizure caused Indigo to again lose all her mobility, and also took away her ability to speak.From the time this nightmare began until today, Indigo has had 5 strokes, and 16 seizures.She can't move or talk the way she used to,  and she is scared and bewildered by what is happening to her. She suffers from night terrors, hallucinations from her anti-seizure medications, vomiting, and overwhelming exhaustion. Her little body has been through so much. Megan and Rob cannot bear to leave her side. They are in agony watching their little one suffer as she is. Her life is hanging in the balance.Indigo has been hospitalized in the ICU for nearly a month now.  As a result of this medical catastrophe, their medical bills are piling up. Current estimates put Indigo's medical bills in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. They need as much help as they can get to help Indigo get well enough to go home, and then to return to the ICU for the second half of her surgery. This beautiful, strong, sweet little girl has been through so much, and she is fighting so hard to live and thrive. Please help as much as you can.",497,2.9k,9,496,3 months,24 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,32,Stroke Rehab for Jacquie Marumoto,https://www.gofundme.com/stroke-rehab-for-jacquie-marumoto,"WESTPORT, CT","May 16, 2018","$100,000","$42,433","Dear Friends & Family of Jacquie Marumoto,As most of you know, a little over a year ago in February of 2017 Jacquie suffered a massive, debilitating hemorrhagic stroke. Those early days and weeks were very medically challenging and it was unclear how or IF Jacquie would ultimately recover. After 6 arduous weeks of fighting for her life in the Yale Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Jacquie was transitioned to Gaylord Rehabilitation for 4 months of intensive therapies where she made significant progress towards gaining independence: improvement in swallowing, feeding, speech therapy etc.. Following this challenging therapeutic rehab experience she was discharged to a rehab center in Fairfield. Jacquie returned home eight months ago. While she has continued to progress, recovery is slower and it is unclear how complete the recovery will be. She is still in a wheelchair and fully dependent on her husband, Larry, sister in-law, Jill, family from California, and many other care providers. Life at home has it’s own set of challenges from the vantage point of a wheelchair: narrow interior doorways, lack of a wheelchair accessible ramp for entering & exiting the home, and limited access to the kitchen only to name a few.Before her stroke Jacquie had an 11 year career with Oracle most recently serving as Senior Director in the health sciences group. She took a very active role in raising their daughter, Avery now 10. Accompanying Avery to her activities, birthday events, and school commitments was something Jacquie always took pride in doing. She enjoyed Yoga classes and was an avid golfer. In short, she was like all of us: multidimensional and enjoying a full work, family, and recreational life.Recently Jacquie was admitted into an outpatient program in Norwalk. However, upon starting the out-patient program her home health aide support was cut off. Now, Larry and young Avery must be responsible for attending to all her daily living needs. This understandably has resulted in an inability for Larry to resume full employment, which in turn has amplified the healthcare cost burden on the family. A prideful man, Larry has resisted overtures for financial help for many months. He chose to draw down the family's savings rather than ask for help. Unfortunately, the costs have now become overwhelming. Jacquie’s projected healthcare costs for the next two years are projected to be over $100k - Insurance, deductibles, therapy equipment, home modifications needed for wheelchair accessibility ….. the list of financial demands is nearly endless !We are fortunate to live in an affluent community, and most of us are lucky enough to have successful careers. Until two years ago, Jacquie and Larry were as fortunate as we are. It is sobering and sad to realize how quickly this can be lost, and how precarious our seemingly stable lives can actually be.While Jacquie has made significant progress and now is, in very general terms, able to:-- speak -- though volume, word recall, and breath control are still issues-- walk using a walker with assistance-- sit upright and maintain balance with some prompting-- transfer from a wheelchair to bed and more with assistance-- accomplish most ADLs (activities of daily living) at a wheelchair level with minimal assistancePlease join us in our goal to ease their burden. We are starting this “Go Fund Me” page in an effort to raise  $100K to help support our friends in need. With our help, Jacquie can continue to progress with her rehab and her home can be made more comfortable and accessible. Our small contributions will go a long way, and Jacquie (and Larry) will be eternally grateful for your generosity of spirit.With love & gratitude, Team JacquieCindy Reejhsinghani, Jill Perlstein, & Sabrina Maurer",199,444,15,206,3 months,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

While no complications and a full recovery were expected, he has experienced several unforeseen challenges and obstacles in his recovery. While his heart surgery was successful, and his heart is getting stronger every day, he continues to be challenged with fluid and collapsed lungs and blood clots. While he remains sedated through this tough time he is now being transported by helicopter to another hospital in central Florida that specializes in the type of recovery he needs right now. Ty’s recovery is going to be very long and difficult, but we all know what a fighter he is and know that if anyone can pull through this it is him. His family has been at his side since the surgery praying for a healthy and speedy recovery. But now this relocation to a central Florida hospital is really taking its toll on his family. To remain vigilant and support his recovery, they now need to temporarily relocate to be at his side. As with any unexpected event support by family is a definite.

Due to recommendations from her doctor at the center, she is going to be receiving a low dose chemo treatment twice a week. This is not a traditional form of chemo and it is administered with insulin. The side-affects are minimal and the results have been very promising with other recipients. However, it is very expensive, well over the cost of the initial treatment plan. Each treatment is $5000 and her treatment calls for 2 infusions per week. In addition to the new cost of treatment, we're looking at an extended stay in California.  We have exhausted every financial avenue available to us and  without your generosity our funds will run out before the end of this week. That is how urgent this request is. We appreciate everything that you have all already given and we humbly ask you to continue to give what you can. Please share with everyone that you can and ask them to share it as well. Hi, We’re Tim and Kaitlyn Yant.. Thanks for taking a few minutes to read our story. We first met when we were just kids in our church youth group but started dating when we ended up going to the same college years later. We got married in November of 2009. We finished school, got real adult jobs, and bought our first house. Everything a young couple usually does. Five years after getting married we decided to start trying to have babies. After years of trying doctors diagnosed Kaitlyn with uterine fibroids but said there didn’t seem to be any other complications other than the fibroids. But, there definitely was... On May 12, 2017 we went out to dinner with Kaitlyn’s family - a normal family dinner on a Friday night. After getting home that evening Kaitlyn began experiencing a lot of stomach pain. After being in pain all night we decided to head to the emergency room on Saturday May 13th. Expecting it to be a common gall bladder issue or something like that, we couldn’t have ever prepared ourselves for the news we were going to get... A CT scan revealed a very large malignant mass in Kaitlyn’s uterus. Kaitlyn was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, low grade serous carcinoma. A punch to the gut. Our world stopped spinning as every plan for our future came crashing down around us. We broke the life altering news to our families that Mother’s Day weekend 2017. Then began the whirlwind of doctors appointments and treatments. Kaitlyn endured surgery after surgery and unsuccessful treatments. We were told that she would have a maximum of 1 year to live. Kaitlyn’s oncologist said that the cancer she has does not usually respond to chemo so if we wanted to pursue having traditional chemo treatments there is a very high chance that it would not work or if it did work, then the chance of the cancer coming back a few years later and being more aggressive is extremely high. BUT, the fight is NOT over yet. Kaitlyn has beat the odds and is now living day by day past the one year original prognosis. Because of the grim outcome of traditional treatments we have chosen for Kaitlyn to seek non-traditional treatments at Cancer Center for Healing in Irvine, CA where they have seen success in stopping and reversing cancer! Cancer has stolen a lot from us - Our ability to have children, our money, and our time. But it can’t take the things that truly matter - our joy, our faith, and our hope. Please warrior on with us in prayer as we cry out for Kaitlyn’s complete healing. Also, please consider donating to help pay for the numerous medical bills, medical supplies, and further treatments that Kaitlyn needs.",301,1.9k,11,346,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

I feel like I could write an entire book. This has been a long difficult road filled with many sad tears, happy tears, big decisions, and everything in between. I’ll stick with a short version for now and write the entire story at another time. During our 20 week ultrasound, which led to several others and a MRI quickly following, the doctors discovered that our baby was missing most of his/her brain. And instead of a brain, it was replaced with cerebral spinal fluid. The fluid was going to continue to expand the head of our baby. The head size was measuring about 3 weeks ahead of normal. We were told our baby wouldn’t live past several days, if not hours, or die before birth. The diagnosis given was semilobar holoprosencephaly, and the prognosis for these cases are very bleak. Essentially since half way through our pregnancy, we have been preparing to bury our precious little one, and spend as much time as possible with him or her as we could. While still pregnant, we tried to do as many memory-making things along the way like: baby’s first motorcycle ride, baby’s first vacation, and other fun things to fill our hearts with happiness instead of focusing purely on the sadness that would inevitably come. Speeding this story up to week 37 with our last ultrasound on Friday, July 27 our perinatologist looked at the ultrasound and said that if we wanted any chance of a normal birth without c-section, we needed to get induced immediately. Baby’s head size has grown to 4-5 weeks ahead of schedule. We were admitted to Mercy without issue within a couple hours and began the birth and induction process. After 2 full days of induction with nothing like our birth plan (more of that story to come later), we gave birth to Matthew James Corpstein at 11:21am, 7 pounds 14 oz, 21 inches. He was breathing and regulated his heartbeat on his own. We were told that these were things he would do, but the doctors weren’t sure he would be able to feed. We were told he likely wouldn’t see, hear, or feel pain. After he was born, he was able to latch and nurse right away. He responded to lights, voices, and touch. These were things that he supposedly wouldn’t do. We decided to do a follow up MRI to determine if the original diagnosis was right. The results came back, and then suddenly we were talking with a pediatric neurosurgeon who said that he definitely DOES NOT have semilobar holoprosencephaly. That there is much more brain tissue than originally thought, and instead he has hydrocephalus. This new diagnosis still means Matthew has extra fluid in his brain, but the difference is that the fluid is pushing the brain tissue to the side of the head, making it appear as if there’s no tissue, when in fact there is. The new MRI showed that they could see all or almost all of the front and right brain tissues, and most of the back side. The left side was difficult to tell because that area had the most fluid that was pushing into all the other sides of his brain. The neurosurgeon told us it’s possible he could lead a completely normal life. Many hydrocephalus babies live with no abnormalities. Many also have some developmental delays or disabilities. We simply couldn’t believe what we were hearing! We had prepared for the last 4 to 5 months of not bringing a baby home, of using hospice and end of life care, and now suddenly Matthew’s chances of survival are high and having a fully functioning life could be possible! It’s like buying a lottery ticket and actually winning the jackpot! We were overjoyed, and I just still can’t put into words how we feel about the amazing news. We know God was protecting us and our beautiful baby boy, and we had put our faith in His hands, come whatever may. So where are we now with all of this?Matthew needed to do emergency brain surgery to drain the fluid from his brain, which would allow his brain tissues to expand back. The surgery happened when he was just two days old, on Tuesday, July 31. This required putting a shunt in his brain, that would drain down into his abdomen. He will have this for the rest of his life, and likely will have other surgeries, tests, and MRIs down the road to make sure it is functioning properly as he grows. Surgery went well, and he is recovering like a champ. The neurology nurses told us this was a very severe case of hydrocephalus, but he is doing remarkably well. A good friend called him Matthew The Great for being such a miracle, and that’s exactly what he is. He is our little miracle. A boy who wasn’t supposed to be born alive, much less do anything else, has showed us that God is protecting us and blessing us beyond anything we can imagine. Matthew means ""Gift from God""!We ask for prayers and well wishes during Matthew’s initial healing and what the future holds. Thank you from the bottoms of our hearts for those of you who are praying, sending messages, and donating money.",796,1.2k,29,741,1 month,2 days ago,1 day,2018-09-03

Through a meeting with his daughter Kassy and friends, they convinced him that his health was a major concern and the drug usage was possibly causing behavioral and physical problems. While hospitalized, they found that his heart was severely thickened, causing heart failure which he will have to be monitored closely and take medication for the rest of his life. Neurologically he has suffered multiple strokes that have affected his entire brain. There are certain parts that will no longer function properly, causing severe behavioral changes and some physical ones. The damage is permanent and irreversible. He will be going to physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and speech therapy to rewire the brain. He will also be going to a rehab center for drug usage when medically better. Currently this is what we know, and these are the conditions he has been diagnosed with: Leukoencephalopathy Intracranial atherosclerosisHypertrophic cardiomyopathyScott is in the care of his Daughter Kassy, his Mother, his sister Coleen, and his brothers.

He is an incredible band director, a friend to all, a mentor to countless students, a devoted family man and a loyal follower of Christ. In January of 2018, John was told due to a  heredity condition, he would need heart surgery. It didn’t seem fair to any of us because John is an incredibly healthy person. However, he chose to follow his doctor’s advice and have the surgery. Within three days of his surgery, and while still in recovery at the hospital, we were told that John had three massive strokes. He was airlifted to another hospital in Charlotte and after a procedure to stop the strokes, was put in the neurological ICU. When he first started to wake up, John was paralyzed on the entire right side of his body. He couldn’t speak, eat, stand, sit up, or even keep his eyes open for longer than a few seconds. Since then, almost 4 months has passed. John has made incredible progress that seemed impossible by many doctors. He has full physical function of his body. He is actually very physically fit considering what he has gone through. Cognitively though, he still has a long road ahead of him. We have discovered through an incredible amount of research, that there is a facility that can help John with his specific needs in Atlanta. His doctors do not think there is any other facility that can help him in the way that he desperately needs. Insurance will not help John pay for the rehabilitation in Atlanta. As a family, we have decided we have to help him get there regardless. We are now at a point that we have exhausted all financial means possible. We are so greatful for the hundreds of people who have already helped John with donations, food, cards, gifts, and keeping his house maintained. We are asking now that anyone out there who knows John personally or through the grapevine, to please donate what you can to his cause.  The rate for care at the facility in Atlanta is over $1000 per day. With an average length of stay of 90 - 120 days we would ultimately need to sell John's home to cover the expense. We are desperately trying to keep his life waiting for him exactly as he left it but we also know we have to get him back first. Any and all help you can give is greatly appreciated by all of us. If you can’t give financially, please add John in your thoughts and prayers. His army of prayer warriors has gotten him through countless hurdles already. Now he just needs to get through a few more.

Occasionally I am asked- ‘what do you like to do when you’re not traveling for work’?  My reply?  “Travel for fun”!But in May 2014, I was diagnosed w “Mumford and Sons”. Ok its MS, or “Multiple Sclerosis”, but I just try to make a very uncool disease sound a little bit cooler to take my mind off the tragic, senseless loss of functions, and mobility, notwithstanding the constant pain and fatigue. Many advances have been made in the medical field for MS that slow the progression of the disease, but there is no cure and there is no stopping the inevitable outcome of permanent disability. In the course of 4 years, I have been on two different treatments, the latest and strongest available- Tecfidera and then Ocrevus, which have been very costly. This has been a great hardship on us, to say the least. The real challenge has been however, that my condition has continued to deteriorate with walking and doing most physical activities extremely hard. Even more challenging is the stress brought from fatigue/exhaustion, extreme sensitivities to heat and the “cog-fog”, or simply the ability to think and to concentrate.MS is a cruel disease, taking most of the things I enjoy in my life away from me and my family. Yes, they have suffered along with me and made countless sacrifices for me along this journey.But there is one and only One treatment to permanently STOP MS, and it is HSCT. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.HSCT                                        Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, blood cell-producing stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs.

The immune system gradually rebuilds itself anywhere from 3 months to a year.NEXT STEPSI have been accepted to Pirigov Hospital in Moscow with Dr. Denis Fedoreno, a world-renowned Miracle Man in this field.I begin treatment on October 22, 2018, so some very short 5 months away! This is terribly exciting and at the same time terribly stressful.  Stressful in the sense of how much preparation is involved, providing care for Lynn as she accompanies me, taking care of my business activities for a period of time, and most of all, for the cost of the treatment. It is $50,000 USD for treatment, including the hospital stay in Russia, and then another estimated $10k for travel and logistics (including lodging for Lynn). Treatment will take approximately 30+ days, so we will be away for some time. And unfortunately, insurance does not cover any of the cost. My goal is to raise $40,000.Despite the difficulties, I have maintained a full-time work schedule, including travel of 100k to 150k miles of flying every year, convention schedules, customer meetings, board meetings, and various other work activities. I have done everything in my power to hold on to a career and job that I love and support my family while doing so. I like to say- “I don’t quit when I’m tired, I quit when I’m finished!” But this dedication has come with a price. A steep price, both physically and mentally.But with a glad heart, I have been Blessed with receiving a “Golden Ticket” (Willy Wonka reference, but you got that, right??) It is worth more than all the Gold in the world, but it also comes with the price of Gold! So far, I have never asked for any help along my journey, but honestly, I am at the point where I must humbly call upon friends and colleagues to consider “investing” in me to help me get my life back! This is a matter of My Life, or a Life left of diminished probabilities and possibilities.I miss taking walks, I miss being able to go out for dinners, to see friends, to make plans and NOT having to cancel, to travel to see the balance of our bucket list, and mostly to be able to practice my violin without excruciating pain in my hands and arms. The list of “I miss” is long, but the chance of doing these things again is Great. Great is His Faithfulness……I do not do this or ask this lightly, it has come from prayerful consideration and a great deal of humility. The fact is, there is a solution, I can see it, I can almost touch it, but I need your help.If would consider playing a part in ‘Reclaiming My Life- 2018”, I would deeply appreciate your help.

Medical,33,Help with Sophie’s hospital bills,https://www.gofundme.com/help-with-sophies-hospital-bills,"CAVE CREEK, AZ","March 29, 2018","$50,000","$40,737","Hello All, Many of you may know Sophie- my beautiful, intelligent and happy four year old niece. Recently she went for her routine four year check up and had very high blood pressure (about 160/100). The doctor told her mom (Ana) to come back and they would check it again. Her blood pressure was high again when they went back. After cat scans and MRI’s they saw a narrowing in her aorta in a few places, a smaller kidney and a enlarged heart. All of this made no sense to any of us, she was always so happy and full of life. Sophie didn’t seem sick at all. Ana and Scott flew Sophie to Cinnicinati children’s hospital to get a procedure done to help with the narrowing. There they discovered that her insides were inflamed so they could not continue with the procedure. At this point we heard the first possible diagnosis of takayasu- an extremely rare auto immune disorder. Sophie was emmited to Phoenix Children’s for 16 days while they tried to treat her inflammation and high blood pressure. She left the hospital recently on seven different types of blood pressure medications, steroids and chemo with the hope that we would continue her treatment at home and get another MRI in 3 months to see the progression. Unfortunatly, that was not the way it worked out. Sophie started crying in pain because her foot was hurting. Ana noticed that it was colder than the other foot and discolored. Worried she rushed her to the hospital. They did more testing on her and found out that she had a massive old and hardened blood clot near her hip and another blood clot in her toe. After two failed procedures to get the blood clot to move, Sophie’s lungs colapased yesterday and she is currently on breathing tubes. Ana and Scott plan to fly her to Boston children’s hospital in a medical emergency plane where they have doctors who have treated this horrible disease takayasu and can help her with her blood clotting. This is the most traumatic event my family has ever been through. Sophie is our little angel and was a happy four year old girl with so much life in her. This experience has drained her and her beautiful parents who are doing everything they can to save their little girls life. The last thing I would want is for them to worry about money and hospital bills. I know that currently they are in a lot of debt with everything that has happened. The debt is the last thing on their mind, but if we can help make their lives easier while they continue this hard and long battle then it would mean the world to them and to me. I appreciate you taking the time to read about Sophie’s story. If you are unable to help financially, just sharing this message and getting the word out there is more than enough. I will also be posting updates of how Sophie is doing periodically. Thank you for your support! We are #sophiestrong! ***Please note: at the moment Ana and Scott are not in a place to discuss Sophie’s state. They are focused on getting her the best care and being a strong support for Sophie in the hospital. Please respect their privacy right now as this is all very new. If you have questions, you can direct them to me. Warmly, Kelsey",399,1.4k,9,391,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Her life was turned upside down one year ago when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.Treatment So Far:  Kat had surgery in March 2017 to remove tumors from her colon and appendix. Since then she has undergone 18 rounds of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the chemo is not working and the tumors continue to spread and grow, threatening vital body functions.Life-Saving Surgery:The latest colonoscopy revealed that Kat has another extremely large tumor that is fast growing and aggressive. Kat will be flying from Santa Rosa, California to Washington DC for a life-saving cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) in March 2018. This surgery will remove the tumor, part of her bowel, spleen, uterus, part of the abdomen and all discovered areas where cancerous cells are found. Immediately after, she will get a high dose, high temperature chemotherapy bath applied directly into the abdomen to attack microscopic cancer cells. Kat will be in the ICU for two days minimum following surgery and in the hospital for at least 14 days. She will probably not be able to walk when released from the hospital.Hope & Your Help:Kat is extremely fortunate that the surgeon who invented this procedure, Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, will be performing the surgery. While Kaiser has agreed to pay for most of the medical expenses, your donations will help towards expenses in Washington DC and with the long recovery back home. Kat has not worked in her full-time job at Santa Rosa Junior College since she was admitted to the hospital one year ago. Thanks:Kat believes this surgery will save her life and give her many additional years with her family. She and her family would like to thank you in advance from the bottom of their hearts for your generosity! She continues to be optimistic, buoyed by the support of her family, friends, and community and finds joy in every day.Thank you so much for supporting our beloved friend, Kat!",282,895,13,286,5 months,4 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

She spent her entire adult life caring for other people’s kiddos, feeding the elderly, and volunteering to cook for kids in the community.  She and her husband, VG, have hosted Danish exchange students and have a rescue Beagle. They open their home to family and friends in need, always offer healthy food, and a sense of community. Monica cares deeply about supporting local businesses and eating the healthiest food available (her instagram is @allmymoneyisforfood). She spreads her love throughout the community with food deliveries, babysitting, and care-taking for local families (many of whom have also been touched by cancer).How Monica Learned She Had Adrenocortical Carcinoma - 1 in a Million chances.Monica finally met the love of her life in 2010. She and her husband were eager to have children but unfortunately this was not possible. This was devastating for such a loving couple who care so much about children. Then in 2015 and 2 miscarriages later, they were both hit by more stunning news. Monica had to have her right adrenal gland and tumor removed. The results came through a week later, it was Adrenocortical Carcinoma “ACC” a one in a million cancer with a very high recurrence rate.  Monica didn’t have to do treatment, as the only chemo used for adrenocortical carcinoma “ACC” is mitotane (a derivative of DDT) and the jury is still out (ongoing clinical trials) as to if it actually prevents recurrence. The only known cure for adrenal cancer is surgical removal. Alternative Diet to Prevent RecurrenceMonica had radically changed her diet to be “plant based” to hopefully prevent recurrence.  For such a rare and “orphan” cancer, where less than 600 cases are diagnosed a year, it’s largely up to the individual to decide which course of treatment is best, to be your own advocate and push for scans to find recurrence ASAP. However the Follow-up Scan found Lesions on the LiverMonica pushed for a scan in the spring of 2017, after coughing for a month or more and worrying that she had a lung recurrence. Fortunately, there was no recurrence in 2017. However, when the next scan came in May of 2018, they did detect liver lesions. The cancer recurrence was also wrapped around her IVC, making surgery more risky.  The head surgeon of Santa Barbara’s Ridley-Tree cancer center said that surgical resection was possible but after further imaging, decided it was impossible at the cottage hospital and too risky. Please Help Monica fight This Inoperable Metastasis Which Chemo Can’t KillBecause of this inoperable metastasis which chemo can’t kill, Monica wants to try holistic therapy in Arizona (as seen in “Cancer Can Be Killed"" documentary on Amazon). Because this approach is non-traditional medicine and is not covered under traditional insurance, the financial burden will be significant. Because this cancer is aggressive, she needs to begin this alternative approach now. Help extend Monica's life. She still has more to give and share with the community. We will continue to update you on Monica's journey in her fight against this cancer. Thanks for sharing this and for your consideration.",218,524,24,237,2 months,17 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

 On August 6th, 2018 Kevin was  diagnosed with Merkel Cell cancer, a rare,  aggressive disease in which malignant cancer cells form in the skin. Disease doesn’t discriminate. But it is especially difficult to comprehend when it attacks someone has spent their entire life supporting others. If you know Kevin then you know that he is a man of incredible character. He is generous of spirit, time, and resources. And he is one of the warmest and most hilarious people you will ever meet.Kevin has committed himself - and his life -  to a practice of radical empathy for others. He also has committed his life to community advocacy. He did this initially during the AIDS crisis with ACT UP from the 1980’s-1990’s. Throughout his life he has supported and mentored many friends and helped them get back on their feet. Kevin’s advocacy work continues to mature and has become more refined over the years; in 2016, days after the Pulse massacre, Kevin co-founded Gays Against Guns (GAG) a volunteer group fighting to save lives through better gun laws. His contribution to this inclusive, grassroots activist group has been integral to its success and has earned him the moniker of “Mother GAG”.  Mother has fought for us, and now we are fighting for her.  Kevin is facing immediate surgery which will be followed by extensive cancer treatments. Kevin has been self-employed as a prop and set stylist for over 20 years. As a result of working under independent contracts, he has zero access to any short or long-term disability through an employer. This means that Kevin will have no income for the entire duration of his treatment and recovery. At least six months, if not more.  And no income means no money to pay for his insurance, his rent, and all basic living expenses. As a self-employed person, he carries the full cost of his health insurance on his own. Even with this insurance, he will be faced with with the significant additional costs of expensive treatments very much needed  to defeat the cancer.  The Hertzog family and the GAG family are asking the community to come together to support Kevin through this difficult time. We very much appreciate your support. Thank you.",241,670,3,241,18 days,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

The E.R. doctors at the time proceeded with a sinus drainage, the experience was painful and pointless, since it was repeated 6 times to no avail.  The infection traveled to the lungs, and quickly went from bronchitis to pneumonia. I was back at the E.R. this time, a month had elapsed and I had dropped from 180lbs to 160lbs. I stayed 2 weeks in the infectious wing of the hospital in Sweden before deciding to fly out to Paris France to see if they could find out what I had.Four days, during 4 days I went through all possible tests and biopsies. Having traveled extensively prior to getting ill, all viruses and diseases were possible. Spinal tap, kidney and lung biopsies. I was so week by then that I couldn't get out of bed, my joints inflamed and locked weighing 146 lbs. In the afternoon of the fourth day the team of doctor and the professor of the Pulmonary department announced they were pretty sure they had pinpointed the culprit, however, my condition had deteriorated so much that there would not be a second try if they were wrong. The doctors were right. It was WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS. For the next 6 months I learnt to handle chemothreapy, then for the next 8 years I managed an illness that had chewed up my kidney to 50%.In January 2018, after completing my semi-annual round of chemotherapy, I got news that my kidneys were failing. This was so sudden it was surreal. I had not seen any signs or better said I couldn't see them because 2017 had been one long and arduous road. The new house I had bought, the family I had, my financial situation, all I had worked so hard to achieve all fell apart. My kidneys are now oscillating between CDK 5 and CDK 4. CDK 5 stands for Chronic Kidney Disease level 5 which is kidney failure, and the need for dialysis before Renal Transplant. CDK 4 means that damage to the kidneys is now irreversible and preparations for dialysis and a kidney transplant are necessary.A donor would, short of saving my life, give me a new life, one where I can taste, feel, live fully, without my body limiting and dictating what I can or cannot do or how active I can be. I work as a tennis pro and for the past 3 months I have been working at 50% of my capacity, eating away at my savings and at my weight, I have lost 12 lbs in the last 2 months. This past week I have been meeting with the transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic in Florida. I am now on a diet to help gain some weight back. I have started weight training again all to be in the best shape for the surgery.￼￼A kidney transplant involves a heavy financial cost, costly drugs and nearly 10 to 12 weeks before I can run and swing a racket after the operation. Every donation of any amount will help tremendously.My family is far away from me, the only family I have in Florida is my 2 year old daughter, who gives me strength and courage when the going gets tough. If you are not able to make a donation, please send your good thoughts and relay my story around you. It is difficult for me to write about this publicly and ask for help, I have tried for so long to keep this quiet and only those close to me really understand how serious things had gotten. ￼",145,376,2,145,3 months,13 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

Everyone that meets Ever loves her radiant smile, winning personality and non-convincing shyness. She's warm, funny, energetic and she's just beginning to explore her skills as a painter, and her role as a big sister.  On March 17th, 2018 Ever's life was changed forever, and our family's life was turned upside down as she was diagnosed with Leukemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-ALL). Needless to say we were utterly devistated upon hearing this diagnosis, but there was a bit of good news in the prognosis--ALL is curable. We now consider ourselves extremely fortunate, blessed, and luckly. We have something to hold onto. We have a hope. We have a (very) good chance to save our baby's life. That right, Ever can be cured and go on the live a close to normal life, but the ride will be long and extremely hard. Indeed, the road ahead is very difficult for Ever (and her family). She will face challenges that 3 year old children should never have face, including an infusion of chemotherapy for the next 26 months, high-frequency visits to the hospital, no exposure to large gatherings of people (public transportation, airplanes, movies, etc), a plethora of chemical cocktails and pills that would scare any sane person, a restricted diet, limited and/or no schooling, and most importantly limited access to friends, family and loved ones (to ensure she is not exposed to infectious diseases, viruses, and bacteria). Still, given the encouraging odds of her survival, we are holding our breaths, crossing our fingers and saying our prayers. That said, there is still a lot we just don't know? There are a lot of expenses that our family will incur that we will likely be unable to cover. We are investing a serious amount of time into understanding this disease, its associated costs, and the best tools for fighting it. Moreover, we are looking at ways to ensure Ever can remain a positive, creative and engaged as a toddler.  Honestly, we (Ever, Mom, Dad, and Shiloh) know its a lot, but we will get it done with the support of our friends, family and loved ones.  We want to thank you in advance for any generosity you can spare for this cause. We have outlined how funds will be used below and we will be upding this page and our facebook page over the next 2 years to keep everyone updated on Ever's progress.Again, we sincerely thank you for your time and generosity.

Medical,34,Help Heal Matt Hallock and Family,https://www.gofundme.com/heal-matt-hallock-and-family,"WATSONVILLE, CA","June 16, 2018","$90,000","$40,301","Hello dear friends, family, and future friends. Thank you to all of you who have encouraged us, pushed us higher, and called out the good that God has put in us...even during times when sickness made it hard to see that any good was there.It has been a few years now since we were publicly sharing details of my health with our friends, family and network. And here's why: We don't want sickness and doctors and treatments to define our lives. God has put a lot more inside us than just that. And to be honest, most of the time we'd rather talk about other dreams and projects, things we know God put us here to do. Thinks like:   --Corrie's book    --Rebecca's dance   --Our Steadfast Marriage ministry     --My newly started Masculine Christian writing endeavors   --My new High School English teaching adventureThese are the things that drive us. They are what God has put us here to do. But friends, it's time for me to talk about my health again. This disease is serious right now, and truthfully, we could use your support.For those of you who don't know our story, it's pretty long. So in case you don't have the time to read the whole thing, here are the bullet points for you.----------------------BULLET POINTS----------------------   1) I have battled a severe, aggressive case of autoimmune arthritis all over my body for 11 years. Was bed-ridden at one point...unable to function let alone work.   2) After 9 years of searching for curative treatments, we've spent the last two years at Stanford receiving heavy duty, dangerous drugs that had been doing a great job at alleviating the symptoms...but not CURING my body.   3) Those treatments...the MOST POWERFUL ones known to our conventional medicine system are not working anymore. And my pain, inflammation, immobility, weight-loss are rushing back aggressively.   4) Leading up to May, I was teaching full time as a High School English teacher (loving it and loving being ABLE to work). This helped us be able to rent our OWN HOME for the first time in 8 years. My girls have their own yard for the first time ever.   5) But my body is getting worse quickly and Stanford is about out of ideas. I can barely get up in the morning. Can't put on socks. Can't brush my teeth. Lots of pain. If school were back in session, I wouldn't be able to work. School starts in August, and I don't know if I will be able to return to teaching at that time.   6) I am also currently stuck on a drug called Prednisone, which is a steroid with serious side effects. It is eating away my bones, skin, and other connective tissues, but it keeps my pain down.   7) This is urgent. My body is getting worse quickly and we want to do SOMEthing to help me be able to work in August.   8) HOW YOU CAN HELP           --Donate to our fund any amount you feel able to           --Sharing this GoFundMe campaign with anyone you can think of who might have the heart and resources to                invest in our family.----------------------THE FULL STORY----------------------STANFORD TREATMENTSAlmost two years ago exactly, Corrie and I decided on a huge shift. For the 9 years prior, we had gone down every route we could find looking for a way to actually cure my body. We changed our nutrition (which we are thankful for and still embrace whole-heartedly). We traveled to a doctor in Nevada...twice.We attacked Lyme Disease, mycoplasma infection, used anything we could find to make headway.But my body still got worse. And it got to the point where I was taking 40mg per day of Prednisone in order to manage my pain and inflammation.At that point, two years ago, my current doctor said I needed to go see a standard rheumatologist and get the standard rheumatology drugs. That may be the only thing that would bring relief.So I went to Stanford, met an amazing doctor, and together we decided on my starting Remicade infusions. This is the. most. powerful. treatment option in the tool belt of standard conventional rheumatology.And for eight months, it worked beautifully. I was able to decrease my Prednisone down to 2mg per day. But then suddenly my body started resisting the Remicade, and my pain and inflammation came back.So we tried many of the other drugs in their tool belt...none of which did anything. And after 2ish months, we went back to Remicade which again helped for another 8 months or so...until this last May.BUILDING A NEW LIFE FOR OUR FAMILYBut before May hit, while that treatment was working, Corrie and I and our two girls (and dog) finally started to feel like we were getting to live a normal life.Last January, I applied for and immediately received a teaching position at my old High School teaching freshmen English. This was the first real job I had been able to work in about 6 years. And I was nervous about whether I'd be able to physically handle the schedule, but we went for it.I loved it. As near as I can tell, my students loved me too. They asked if I could teach sophomore English next year. They'd say I was their favorite teacher.I shared Jesus with them daily. I prayed for them. I saw Jesus heal them. And I've been planning with the administration a chapel venue that I could lead next year aimed at discipling the young men to be strong, confident, God-on-fire men ready to bring value to their world.Also, right after my starting teaching, we were able to move out of living with family and finally rent our first own home in 8 years. This is where we are now, and we love it. It's been a dream of ours that has felt so out of reach during the times when I could hardly get out of bed.Here's the girls playing in their first ever backyard :)The feeling of finally giving my family a home is amazing. I've been working hard both teaching and running my already existing side-business coaching students on the SAT in order to get our feet under us after these many years of dealing financially with this disease.THE CURRENT STATE OF MATT'S HEALTHBut then, this past May, the treatments I'm getting at Stanford, the most powerful option they know of, started not working again. And this time, my pain and inflammation started raging back faster and harder than before.It's difficult to share with you the severity of the condition, because it doesn't carry the same tragic connotation that other diseases do. You hear arthritis and you think, ""Well, that sucks, but at least it's not cancer or something.""I currently am waking up every morning in intense pain all through my body. So much so that I can't put on socks or brush my teeth. That pain and stiffness start to subside a little bit around 3pm and then ramp back up around 8pm. My feet joints are crooked and my toes are bending over on themselves. My knees don't straighten all the way.Years ago, my right elbow had such severe arthritis that it locked in about a 90 degree angle, and is still locked today.  Also I dropped down to about 115 pounds and looked awful. Corrie thought I was going to die.That's me, weighing something-a-grown-six-foot-man-shouldn't-weigh :)Now, my left elbow and wrist are starting to go the same direction.The pain and immobility are bad enough to lead me to cancel my speaking commitment at our church tomorrow, Father's Day 2018.At the moment, if school were in session, I wouldn't be able to work. School starts early August, there's a real possibility that I won't be able to go back.All of this from something that has been called Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropothy, Lyme Disease, or (most recentlly by Stanford) Psoriatic Arthritis.MATT'S CURRENT TREATMENT SITUATIONSo, after spending 9 years pursuing alternative treatments that were somewhat financially manageable, we finally went to one of the top facilities in western medicine and now their best option for me is not working. We are trying some other less powerful options but still seeing no effect.Since that's the case, my only option at the moment is to increase my Prednisone dose to very high levels, so that I can function. The problem with that is that Prednisone causes thin, tearable skin, brittle bones, and a host of other major side effects. I have broken my back and ribs and arm because of this.Also, it gives me quite a puffy face when the dose is high!But I choose either that or the daily pain and inflammation.HOW YOU CAN HELP FINANCIALLYI tell you all of this so that you can know two things:a) We want to take ownership of our lives and take care of ourselves so that we can give to others. I work hard and want to work harder and plan to.b) Even though I work hard and want to take care of my own crap, right now this disease is a big giant to slay. And I need help.We have set our goal at $90,000...here's the breakdown:Rent and Expenses through 2018 = $35,000We JUST got blessed with moving into our own home after all this time. I'm looking at maybe not being able to work and receive my salary when August hits. I want with all my heart to keep my family in our home and to give me more time to get my body well so I can get back to work and pay our own way.This portion would allow for that very thing.I will also be investing time, energy, and resources in my existing SAT business so that, if December hits and my body still needs more time, our business will be able to sustain us better than it does right now.Treatment at the Paracelsus Clinic in Switzerland = $55,000My body needs intensive, effective treatment. The best our system has to offer isn't working. Before, we tried visiting different doctor's offices in our area but nothing so advanced, all-encompassing, and powerful as this clinic in Europe.This is an estimate of the cost of the three week, daily treatment program that I would do there, including lodging and travel. I know that looks insanely expensive, but to put it in perspective...One of my Remicade infusions costs $50,000. And I get those every six weeks. And they're not even working anymore! (Thank goodness for Medicare)It's time I get freaking serious about healing because I'm done living on borrowed time that these super powerful drugs have given me. Clearly, under the surface of alleviated symptoms, my body is still massively struggling to be healthy.I don't have time to toy around with anything less than the most powerful options out there.My family needs their husband/dad/man to be strong and able to provide. Able to lead. That's why I'm not wasting time with little office visits here and there. This is serious.URGENCYWhile there is no hard deadline on this...we have to move quickly for a couple reasons.1) I want to teach again come August. I love it and the kids need me.2) My body, when it starts to flare up, gets worse very quickly.  One week I can be playing outside with the girls, and the next I can be barely able to step out the door.3) Planning for our finances, if I don't return to work in August, we will need to pay rent and other expenses while I get my body back online.For all those factors, I want to move fast and begin action on this even within the next month.FINAL THOUGHTSWe know with all our hearts that God is our provider. We have seen him do miracles in our finances without us ever asking anyone. But right now, we are asking you, the people that he has used to bless our lives so much already, if you can help us during this fourth-quarter-half-court-shot time.If you are able to donate, you would bless our whole family. Even if you can't donate, could you please share this with your network? Social media, personal emails, calls, whatever you think of. I'm calling all hands on deck for this one, so however you are able to spread the word, we would be very thankful.Bless you all. I pray that Jesus fills you all with his goodness and hope and that he answers any places of pain in your own life and brings you victory...even that victory that you've been waiting a long time for.You were meant to conquer. Never settle for anything less. We love you.",240,636,18,250,2 months,2 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

A freshman at Central Michigan University, he began having pain in his hip that continued off and on throughout his first semester. The pain intensified around Christmas of 2017 at which point he was referred to an orthopedic doctor who suspected it was an injury from his last baseball season. ￼￼￼An MRI done in January of 2018 showed a mass on his hip at which point he was referred to an Orthopedic Oncologist that diagnosed him with Fibrous Dysplasia. With the Dysplasia diagnosis, it was recommended that he begin physical therapy. Noah went to therapy three days a week for six weeks with no resolve to his pain, in fact it had exacerbated. Undergoing another MRI, doctors discovered that the mass on his hip had enlarged to the point that it fractured his femur. Surgery was then scheduled for June 20th to clean out his joint as well as biopsy the inflamed area. ￼￼￼On June 28th his biopsy results confirmed that the mass on his pelvis was actually a Tumor, more specifically a bone Tumor named Ewing’s Sarcoma.Ewing’s Sarcoma for those who do not know, is a very rare type of cancerous tumor that grows in ones bones or the soft tissue around ones bones. Ewing’s sarcoma affects about 200 children and young adults every year in the United States. Within a week of this diagnosis, Noah underwent a PET scan, 2-D scan, multiple x-rays, an MRI, blood work and a bone marrow test. By the grace of God, his sarcoma did not metastasize and is currently contained within his pelvis. It has grown to the size of a tennis ball, pushing on his bladder. ￼￼￼Those of you who know Noah are well aware of the incredible young man he is. We have not once heard Noah complain about this diagnosis. He is an inspiration to all of us with his continued positive outlook on life. He has always been an exemplary student, graduating high school with a 4.0 GPA while maintaining his commitments to baseball and family. He has just begun his next journey pursuing a career in business at Central Michigan (again still maintaining his 4.0 GPA his freshman year). The evening of his biopsy surgery he made sure to complete an assignment that was due for an online summer course he was taking! The kid does not stop! This is why we know he will beat this with a vengeance!￼￼￼￼￼￼Noah’s treatment will require chemotherapy and radiation, along with extended hospital stays due to the intensity of his treatments over the course of the next year. He will require multiple scans, x-rays and MRI’s during and following treatment.It goes without saying that all of your continued prayers, love and support mean so much to the Holloway’s! If you are also able to offer any financial support your contribution will help to pay for Noah’s treatment for this disease which includes insurance deductibles, co-pays and any out of pocket expenses for treatments, medication and supplements not covered by insurance. Even the smallest donations will help. ￼￼￼As Noah begins his treatments, please continue to keep him in your thoughts and prayers. We know that with the support of those around him; his strength, determination and faith will guide him through this next year and kick this disease! Thank you, we are beyond grateful for all of your support!￼￼￼*This GoFundMe is organized and run by Noah Holloway's family members; Jonathan Ren, Kristyn Ren, Rich Ren & Traci Ren in the Metro-Detroit area. All contributions made to his cause go directly to the care and future of Noah Holloway including insurance deductibles, co-pays, out of pocket expenses for treatments, medication and supplements not covered by insurance.

He especially likes when he gets to snuggle with his daddy. He and Daddy have a special bond between them.  He always sleeps with three stuffed animals and one is always the same. It’s a dog called Bolt from the Disney movie. He will rotate the other animals around but he always has Bolt.  In fact, Bolt is here in the hospital with us and it’s getting pretty ragged. He will always share whatever he has without question whether it be food or toys or anything.  When he gets in trouble or does something he shouldn’t, he is always the first to want to say sorry and mean it. There is not a mean bone in this little boy’s body.  Mommy and  Mayz have  a special relationship too. He will pick flowers out of the front yard or anywhere to give to Mom almost every day. He tells Mom that she is beautiful and that he loves her all the time. He’s even says, ""You are the best mommy in the whole world.""   He always wants to help Mom bring in the groceries, make dinner or cleanup. He is the first person to give you a hug when you are feeling sad. He plays baseball and loves his video games. He is a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Star Wars. Mayz also loves the Angels and his favorite player is Mike Trout. He even picked #27 for his jersey number this year.  Early in March 2018, Mayz had a simple headache and went to the Doctor. That simple headache turned out to be every parent's worst nightmare, a malignant brain tumor. On March 12th, he had surgery to remove his tumor, which Doctors were able to completely remove. Unfortunately during that surgery, it was found that he has small spots on the backside of his brain and spine. Mayz had another surgery a few days after to put in a small tube to let fluid be released more naturally. This is an alternative to getting a permanent shunt. We are hopeful that this procedure works so that we don’t have to have another one. Pathology came back with results on the tumor. It is Medulloblastoma “metastatic” meaning it’s trying to spread.  This explains the spots the doctor saw in his brain and on his spine. He is at high-risk and will most likely need radiation and chemo therapy, maybe even at the same time. We keep praying and staying positive for our little “ Warrior”. (Thanks to the Lozano family for this title!) Mayz misses his friends, family, and teammates and hopes to soon be able to run, jump and play with everyone. He is a fighter with a never give up attitude and we all believe in his ability to make a full recovery. In the meantime, the whole process has been extremely hard on not only him but his family. His Mom Heather, Dad AJ, and Brothers Johnny and Skyler have all been doing their best to be there for him and cope with the situation.  THE ONE THING THE GONZALEZ FAMILY NEEDS IS THE GIFT OF TIME WITH MAYZ. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR DONATED WILL GIVE HIS FAMILY THAT TIME. This page is set up to help Mayz and his family in this difficult time. Any and all types of donations are considered a blessing. We thank you all so much for your love and support. Please support Mayz by keeping him in your thoughts and prayers! Your support will also lift his spirits and give him strength to continue the fight! #PlayForMayz #PrayforMayz#TeamMayz",412,2.1k,32,410,5 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Specialty doctors at the Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio have informed us that our unborn son, Israel, has an obstructed bladder. This complication has in turn caused a myriad of other problems including Chronic post-renal kidney failure (the kidneys aren’t functioning), a massive urinoma (fluid filled cyst in the stomach), almost complete lack of amniotic fluid (which is crucial for lung development), and slightly underdeveloped lungs (due to the lack of amniotic fluid). To combat this, we are now driving four and half hours to Cincinnati and staying in hotels weekly in order for my wife to receive amnioinfusins (infusing artificial amniotic fluid), as well as getting extractions from the urinoma in order to drain the cyst of fluid. We have been informed that we will need to continue doing this weekly for several weeks, at which point we will have to increase the visits to twice a week. Ultimately we will have to relocate to Cincinnati for the remainder of the pregnancy for inpatient care. Because of the kidney failure, our baby will almost undoubtedly need surgery when he is born so that he can undergo Peritoneal Dialysis for the first few years of his life, until eligible for a kidney transplant. Because of this dialysis we will have to spend approximately six more months in Cincinnati until we are finally able to bring our baby home.We have been fortunate enough to have very good health insurance, but insurance doesn’t cover everything, and unfortunately, things like the weekly amnioinfusions are being charged to us personally at $950 a piece, a week. My wife will also likely need to go on short term disability at some point. As a small business owner, my business and income has taken a hit due to constant weekly travel to Cincinnati. Doctors have notified us that Dialysis can cost between $50,000 - $80,000 a year. On top of the large expense for Dialysis, copayments for medical expenses, gas, food, and hotels in Cincinnati are beginning to pile up. Additionally, financial responsibilities back at home that are still prevalent including monthly car payments, mortgage, my shop payments, and expenses related to our other three children. With less time being able to work due to increased trips to Cincinnati, we have decided to reach out to this community for financial help. We have already had to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket and the financial burden is only increasing in both frequency and amount as time goes on – Feeling overwhelmed by this, we know we need a miracle. My wife and I humbly ask that if you find it in your heart to help financially, that you donate whatever you can towards helping us, and most importantly, little Israel with his hard journey ahead.We understand that this journey will take many years, but it is a journey that we are proud to walk and just want to give our little baby all the love, help, and hope he needs in the world, so again we humbly ask you to walk this journey with us. We will be strict in using any money donated for the procedures and help for Israel and the special care required after he is born. We are committed to providing photos and videos, as updates to keep everyone informed as we go along this journey. We also ask that you keep all of us, especially Israel in your constant thoughts and prayers. We ask that you please share this and our story with everyone you know if you feel compelled to do so. We will be forever truly and genuinely grateful for any and all help provided to us and already feel convicted to help others with similar problems in the future. To read more in detail about our entire story thus far, please read below. Thank you all so much for taking the time in reading this and God bless.Our Story Thus Far:On February 2nd, 2018, my wife, mother, father, and I anxiously went to the hospital to have our scheduled sonogram, which was to definitively determine the sex of our baby. A few minutes into the sonogram, with smiles lighting up our faces, the nurse asked to excuse herself so that she could retrieve the doctor. I vividly remember a tangible chill creeping down my spine as the nurse left the room as our bright smiles turned to confused and concerned blank stares. The doctor came into the room, looked at the sonogram, and asked me and my wife if we would like to hear some updated news she was about to tell us in front of my parents, or if we preferred it privately. Privacy didn’t matter to us at this moment, we both quickly exclaimed “Just tell us what’s going on with our baby”. The doctor’s face was not that of joy, but more of concern. She proceeded to tell us that there was a massive, unknown cyst where the left kidney should be, there was almost no amniotic fluid around our baby, and she was very concerned that our baby might not make it... just like that, in a single, unforgettable moment, the words that poured from the doctors mouth immediately flooded the entirety of the room. The blow from this knowledge was the most surreal, immediate, gut wrenching hit I have personally ever experienced in my life, blindsiding us in a life changing way on a day that started out with so much happiness and hope. After hearing these crippling words, my wife broke down and started crying. I remember thinking to myself “You have to take care of this women, she is your priority, you can worry about yourself later” I gently grabbed her hair, softly kissed her on the forehead and said, “I love you Monica, everything is going to be ok...”Nobody prepares you in life for how incredibly hard it is to make someone you love believe something that you yourself, at the bottom of your own heart don’t fully know or believe. I pride myself with being an integrity driven, honest man, but in that moment I just wanted to make her emotional pain stop - I said whatever I had to in order to make that happen. The doctor informed us that we would need to be transferred to Peoria’s Children’s Hospital for further testing. We left our hometown hospital after our appointment was finished and headed straight for Peoria. The drive there was completely silent, until we almost reached Peoria. I turned on a song called Here as in Heaven performed by Elevation Worship. At the end of this particular song, the lyrics “A miracle can happen now, for the spirit of the Lord is here” rang out in my car. For the first time, tears poured from my eyes, not in a sobbing way, but more of an uncontrollable leaking of emotion and fear from my eyes, completely silent, hand in hand with my wife, finally realizing and coming to terms with the severity of our baby’s situation, understanding that more than likely we would need a miracle.Once we got to Peoria, they ran a few more tests and told us that the situation for our baby did not look good at all. They informed us that one of their big concerns was this unknown giant mass of fluid where the left kidney should be and that since there was almost no amniotic fluid around the baby, the chances that the baby could compress his umbilical cord and completely choke it off was a real possibility. This was all the news they had for us during our initial visit. We were told that they would know more in ten days at our next appointment and sent us on our way back home. Those were the longest ten days of our lives, every morning dreading the answer when I asked Monica if she had felt the baby kick each morning, fearing for the worst. Ten days slowly crept by and we finally went back to Peoria. Doctors informed us that after yet another sonogram, the mass of fluid had grown, and there was nothing that they specifically could do. They told us that if we would like, they could contact specialists at the Children’s hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio to see what they could do. We promptly agreed. On the way home from Peoria, feeling defeated, we received a call from Cincinnati saying that they could get us in to see the specialists in a weeks’ time. So we packed our bags, reserved hotel rooms, and impatiently waited for more time to pass.The time had finally come for us to drive 4 and half hours to Cincinnati, and we couldn’t get there fast enough. We arrived Monday, February 19th in the evening, anxiously awaiting our appointment Tuesday morning at 7:30am. On Tuesday, my mother had flown in from Arizona where her and my father were visiting my brother and his wife. The three of us met a social worker and Urologist first thing on Tuesday. We were informed that Israel’s right kidney (the one they could actually see) had some micro cysts that were apparent, and one prominent cyst on it, possibly showing evidence of damage to the right kidney. We left the hospital that day feeling worse than we had before when we still had hope that the right kidney was working.That Wednesday, Monica had an MRI, an echocardiogram for the baby, and we had a team meeting with six other specialist and a handful of nurses. Walking into the conference room where the team meeting was being held was a little overwhelming and also eye opening to see just how dire the situation for our baby was. Seeing all those white coats in one room just waiting to talk to us personally was unnerving to say the least. The amazingly detailed staff explained to us that the MRI had shown that this mass was a urinoma, but that they didn’t fully know what the fluid was exactly yet. They informed us that the baby needs amniotic fluid around it (which our baby had close to none) for healthy lung development prior to birth. Without this development, life simply is not possible. They also informed us that there was a bladder obstruction which is what actually caused the urinoma. Doctors explained that the kidneys at the time they were functioning, got backed up because of the pressure of not being able to be released through the bladder. The blockage and backup is ultimately what caused damage to Israel’s kidneys. The staff informed us that we had the option to do nothing, which they are obligated to say. The doctors explained that doing nothing would mean almost certain death for Israel. A second option was given, to proceed with steps to counter these problems and come up with a plan. They informed us that if we decided to move forward with this, that this would more than likely be a very hard, long road to travel. I promptly made it clear to them all that this is a child, not just any child - it’s our child. This is a human being and we are going to fight as hard as we possibly can for this little one, no matter what strains or hardships are in store for our future. The doctors looked to each other as if to all be in understanding around the room that our decision was clear. After a brief pause, one of the doctors spoke up and said that if we were planning on moving forward, the first step would be to do a procedure that involves sticking a needle into Monica’s lower abdomen to extract the fluid from the urinoma. He further explained that the procedure would involve either pulling the needle out just far enough to infuse artificial amniotic fluid, or potentially utilizing an additional needle for the amino fusion. I asked him when he could perform this thinking to myself we would have to wait another week or so, but he promptly said “I can do this for you tomorrow”. My wife and mother immediately teared up and we all sincerely and genuinely thanked the specialists numerous times before leaving the room, my wife and mother hugging most of them as we left.Early Thursday morning, around 2:30am, I woke up, not able to sleep and opened up the Bible app on my phone. The first verse that came up was Genesis 32:22, where Jacob wrestled with God, and God renames him Israel. Since we found out we were pregnant while in Jerusalem, we had already considered naming our baby Israel, but after reading this passage on that nervous, early Thursday morning, I felt like I was wrestling with God through the current situation and like this baby was wrestling for his life. After discussing my thoughts further with Monica that morning we decided our baby’s name will be Israel. That morning my wife and I met my mother at the hospital and went in for the procedure. I remember being nervous, especially for my wife, but we knew we were in very good, very capable hands. The doctor explained to us that with this procedure, there is a low risk of premature birth or miscarriage, but a risk just the same, so Monica signed the waiver and he started. Seeing a doctor insert an 8 inch needle into your wife is unpleasant, and I can only imagine the physical feeling that it gave her was even more so, but I held her hand as he started the procedure, all the while, keeping my eyes glued to the sonogram monitor. The doctor ended up draining 120mls from the urinoma, which is about a half cup of fluid from this little baby’s stomach. I remember seeing how much fluid he extracted and just wondering to myself “how?” I then saw from the sonogram monitor the doctor pull the needle out just enough to position the tube where it needed to go in order to infuse the artificial amniotic fluid, and started to infuse. I honestly can’t tell you the feeling that swept over me as I saw this amazing doctor breath hope and life back into our child, even now writing this, it brings tears to my eyes. We could physically see this fluid rush in on the monitor, and our little creation of God immediately respond by moving his arms and legs, feeling the fluid that started to surround him, playing in it... It is a sight that I will never forget as long as I live.After the procedure, the doctor informed us that they would send off the fluid for testing and would have the results back in a couple weeks. He told us that we would have to return to Cincinnati weekly for these extractions and infusions, for the next month or two and that towards the end of the pregnancy, we would have to return twice a week ultimately having to relocate to Cincinnati for the rest of her pregnancy and possibly some time afterwards. We went back to the hotel so that Monica could rest before we had to travel the four and a half hours back home the next morning. I immediately started to think about the severity of how our lives were going to change and what we could do in order to adapt the very best way possible.Since then, we have gone back to Cincinnati every week. On the third visit they received the results of the fluid from the urinoma and told us that they are abnormal, meaning that the kidneys aren’t functioning properly and Israel will more than likely need to be put on peritoneal dialysis after he is born. This also means that we will have to stay in Cincinnati for an average of six months and that baby Israel will have to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for a few years until he is eligible for a kidney transplant. Monica and I will also have to take training classes in order to understand how to do everything properly once we are able to bring him back home with us. The doctors don’t know how the lungs will develop and as of right now, they are right below the low end of normal, so there is still hope on that front.Needless to say, this is a very stressful and overwhelming time for everyone involved, but there is no other option. I can’t not love my unborn son and refuse to do anything less than fight as hard as I can for him. Throughout this entire endeavor thus far, the one constant is Israel’s strong, beating heart, it is unwavering as is ours to do everything we can to love this child. We humbly ask that you keep us in your hearts and in your prayers, and that you share our story with everyone that you know. We will continue to have faith that ultimately, this little baby’s life is in God’s hands. We have been fortunate enough to have amazing support from friends and family and will without a doubt keep everyone that donates, prays, and who has helped in any way completely informed and updated. Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our story, God bless you all.",297,2.4k,12,334,5 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Even then, God placed a guardian angel with Jeff when a relative happened to be only a few cars behind. Once he identified Jeff, he used a crow bar to gain entry and pull him from his vehicle. Jeff was then med-flighted to Roanoke Memorial Hospital.￼￼Upon his admission, it was discovered Jeff had no feeling below his chest line. He had suffered what doctors called a catastrophic injury to his spinal cord as well as other acute injuries.Jeff’s medical team was able to stabilize his condition, but after further evaluation doctor’s suggested a surgery to stabilize and decompress Jeff’s spine. Roughly 24 hours after his initial arrival Jeff’s surgical team performed a procedure to insert a series of rods and screws into his spine. What doctors found during Jeff’s surgery was a complete spinal cord injury at his T2 vertebrae. His spinal cord was extremely inflamed and his dura shredded.While Jeff’s surgery was successful, he still remains in the ICU on blood pressure stabilization meidications and doctors were clear that it was unlikely that Jeff would ever walk again. As Jeff shifts modes to recovery we must pray that he is the one in a million that can beat the odds. However, as we pray and support Jeff in his journey, the interim is sure to be full of challenges.There will be many expenses associated with Jeff’s journey to recovery: hotels, meals, babysitters, dog sitters, travel, the list is longer than any of us can fathom.A dime, a dollar, a dozen - anything you can give to remove financial burden through these trying times is going to aide in Jeff’s recovery. And more important than pennies are prayers. Find time to pray as often as possible for Jeff, Sarah, Emma and their family.Thank you for being a part of Jeff’s Journey. And remember, “Our prayers may be awkward. Our attempts may be feeble. But since the power of prayer is in the one who hears it and not in the one who says it, our prayers do make a difference.”",325,2.4k,25,295,17 days,12 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

As we all know, lives, priorities, and future plans can change in an instant and this is sadly the case for Officer Hensler. Jeremy is a 13-year veteran of BHPD and served five years as a police officer in Richardson, Texas before moving to Illinois with his wife and young daughter. His daughter is now 15 years old, beginning her high school years and is the light of Jeremy's life.Jeremy has spent all of his adult life in public service and he has gone above and beyond in his career at BHPD, serving 12 years as a Northern Illinois Police Alarm System (NIPAS) Emergency Services Team (EST) sniper. Jeremy is also a 10-year veteran of the United States Marine Corps in which he served as an infantry rifleman in the 1st Battalion 9th Regiment at Camp Pendleton, California – consequently, he is very proud and was initially reluctant in allowing Department members to organize a request for assistance on his behalf.Jeremy is currently on an administrative desk assignment and is in the process of obtaining a non-duty-related disability. He will need progressively more care and assistance during the course of this terrible disease. While we all pray for a miracle cure or remission, we also realistically know that the financial strain on Jeremy is something he should not need to worry about. Any assistance you may provide to assist Jeremy in facing this difficult disease will be greatly appreciated by him, his daughter, and the entire Barrington Hills Police Department staff.  Thank you,Barrington Hills PD",316,562,18,319,2 months,12 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He was unable to pass the physical and began using intense holistic medicine. That cleaned him up short term and allowed him to become established in his career, but soon manifested into debilitating Ulcerative Colitis. He then lost extreme weight, was bleeding consistently, ended up in the hospital multiple times and almost lost his life. He tried several modern medicine regiments for years, including a chemotherapy but the drugs did not help and in some cases deteriorated his body and liver even more. With discipline and diligence he was able to alter his diet and follow an intense holistic regimen and just limp along in his job and life. The “cure” for PSC is a liver transplant, but the medical community will not even consider putting him on the transplant list due to the Ulcerative Colitis, so there is no cure in current medical protocols.

Medical,36,Pray for Rye Guy,https://www.gofundme.com/prayforryeguy,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK","April 29, 2018","$100,000","$39,036","On Saturday, April 21st, at 10:11 am Rick found Rye unresponsive.  Jazzy heroically dialed 911 while Rick and a neighbor (who is an ER doctor) began CPR.  Julie was at a Foreign Language Teachers Conference in Jenks.  Once both parents had arrived, the ER doctor kindly, but clearly explained that since there had been no oxygen to Rye's brain for approximately 30-40 minutes we would be having conversations about organ donation withing 24 hours and that he would not survive.  That has been the consistent message from medical teams from the beginning.  The brain was expected to reach peak swelling by around 72 hours.  If herniation did not occur before that, an MRI would be performed.  The MRI Wednesday afternoon confirmed that there was extreme damage and cell death at all levels of the brain and on both sides.  The very minimal activity was from a very abnormal brain sending very abnormal signs.  With that news, coupled with the absolute lack of any physical responsiveness to hourly neurological tests (light shining in eyes, pinching of fingers, swabbing of eyeballs, tickling of feet, etc.), the family was made aware that it would be acceptable at any point to proceed with donor matching.  The desire of our family the entire time is for God to either completely heal and save Rye's life or save the lives of others through organ donation.  We love that physical picture of how Christ lost his life to give others eternal life.  Doctors and amazing nurses have worked tirelessly to ensure via the respirator, all kinds of medicines and monitors that Rye's organs stay healthy.  Since Julie needed a bit of time to process things, she asked if Saturday, a week after the accident, would be a reasonable day to let go of this precious child who may very well have been in Heaven (not the hospital) the entire week and move forward with donation.  Doctors said that would be fine while offering another day to Rick, ""we can do this earlier if you like.""  While dreading that possible moment on Saturday, we prayed for God to give us any clear sign that Rye might possibly be in that body or that He make him completely brain dead so we could have no doubt in our minds that it is God, not us, taking our child's life.  Being a donor family comes with the complication that finality of earthly life is less visibly clear.  Even after declaration of death, machines will keep this child's body ""alive.""  We, as parents, will potentially not see our child breathe his last and have the closure of such a scene.  We may have already seen that.  Julie has repeatedly said that ""I am not sure if Rye is in this hospital, but I am very sure that Jesus is. God is clearly in every person who visits, hugs, prays, brings coffee, sings over Rye, etc.""         Friday, April 27, God blessed us with postponing our Saturday plans.  Rye showed an appropriate response to pain.  He moved his shoulder when his shoulder was pinched hard intentionally by the physician (instead of inappropriately moving his leg, for example).  His eyes opened.  We count those moments as God's kindness in letting us see his eyes again and in giving doctors a reason to wait things out a bit.  Again, doctors are very honest about how small a sign that is scientifically.      So, we wait.  And we pray.  And we rejoice that we have this time with Rye's physical body here so that the beautiful body of believers can join us in the grieving, hoping, waiting, praying, crying, singing, laughing, eating, hugging, holding, touching walking, talking, etc.  We thank our Father that, Rye, who has no living grandparents and no relatives in the state has the biggest family ever imagined in the brothers and sisters in Christ who internationally are going before the throne of the Creator of the Universe daily on his behalf.  We know God can heal him here completely.  We pray He will.  Regardless, we trust His character that never changes and is always good, always for us, always faithful, always loving and always righteous.",158,985,2,160,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

It’s not everyday that you find out you have cancer. My name is Michelle Jannette Barroso, born and raised in San Francisco California and I just turned 48 years old this past June. I graduated from Immaculate Conception Academy, and then from Dominican College of San Rafael with my BSN. I am a registered nurse in Labor and Delivery at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. I’m the wife of Eduardo Barroso who is a carpenter and works for the city of San Francisco for MUNI, and the proud mother of three beautiful children; Melissa and Loreto who are both in college, and Cheree who is in high school. On June 16th I was alarmed to find 11 pea sized lumps around my neck. So that following Wednesday I scheduled a doctors appointment, just to be safe and say I had it checked out. The following week on Junes 26th, we received the results of my biopsy. They told me they had found Adenocarcinoma, I had Cancer. We conducted the necessary diagnostic tests to find out how severe my case was and where exactly in my body the cancer was. We were so convinced we had caught it early, I felt normal, no side effects, my electrolyte and metabolic panels all came back within normal range. Looking at me, you never would have guessed.On my 21st Wedding Anniversary, July 5th, my family and I went to Kaiser and received the devastating prognosis. I have stage 4 Metastatic Adenocarcinoma, and it has spread throughout my body. It is in the lymph nodes throughout my body, my mediastinum, esophageal junction, my liver, pancreas, stomach, lower hip bones, and my pelvic bones. The doctor told me that without treatment that I have 6 months, up to a year. I have always had a positive outlook on life. I’ve always promoted the whole power of intention, power of attraction, the secret, etc. So naturally I’m trying to think positive, but I have to admit, I am super scared. I don’t know what my future holds. All I know is that I am not ready to leave this world.After some research we found that in my case, chemotherapy would only increase my presumed time by 5%. So this is my plea for help. I have found that there are cures for cancer in other countries, treatments that are not made available here in the United States. Since they are treatments not offered here, my insurance will not cover it. That is where this GoFundMe comes into play. Please help me with my cause, anything helps, even a dollar, whatever you can afford. I want to help in finding the cure, make a difference, and tell my story to the world.

And it can change everything. As many as you may know our beloved Kim Klonaris was diagnosed with lymphoma this July, shortly after she was in Nassau caring for her mother who is currently battling breast cancer. It was a heavy blow. At 42, and in excellent health, no one could have ever imagined this would be a part of Kim’s journey. Naturally, the family has been completely thrown into a whirlwind. The lymphoma is Marginal zone low grade b-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and requires aggressive chemotherapy treatments - including some hospitalization. We are so grateful because the prognosis is good. However, Kim had to make the very hard decision for her to leave her precious 8 year old daughter Eleni, husband Charles, family, church and friend support system as well as her home and begin rigorous chemo and medical treatments in the US for the next two and a half months. Kim and Charles run a small airfreight business on island and now Kim is unable to work. Insurance covers some of her treatment but not all costs. Some of her cancer medicines out of hospital are not covered nor is travel, food and accommodation costs for family members who will be looking after Kim. In just over two short months, Charles and Kim have spent well over 10K out of pocket. Anyone who has faced a similar battle knows only too well how quickly it all adds up. Kim and family have been long time members of the Lucayan Presbyterian Kirk and have always generously supported charitable causes in our wonderful Freeport Community. She and her family are so kind and humble, always giving. She and her family have never asked … nor will they ever ask … for help, even though they need it. Sometimes, though, we have to stand in the gap. So, on behalf of all of Kim and Charles’ family, friends and all who have asked how they can help, I’m asking. This is going to be a very tough battle for Kim and her family. Physically, emotionally and financially. Tremendous love and support are needed. So true to the village we Grand Bahamians truly are, there have been many calls, emails, texts, prayers and messages of love and support. Many have asked how they can help and, for those in a position to do so, a donation is a tangible way to help them in the journey ahead. Every donation, in any amount, helps and is so very much appreciated. We are grateful for whatever help you can give – donation or otherwise. Most importantly, please keep the prayers coming - Kim is so strong in her faith and has found great comfort in all the prayers, love and support she has already received…thank you! The unexpected does happen. Amazingly, in the midst of the toughest battles come the most extraordinary – and unexpected - displays of faith, strength, perseverance, support and love. And, that changes everything. Please feel free to share this post to your Facebook page in an effort to get the word out. Let’s support our sweet Kim and let her focus on getting better.

As Christian brothers and sisters we have a unique way to help “Carry each other’s burdens” as they face uncertain times.On March 23, 2018 Jim was diagnosed with carcinoma in the base of his tongue over two inches wide with metastasis to nearby lymph nodes. This was after just a few weeks of some headaches, a sudden painful lump in his neck, and problems swallowing.  He is currently under the care of a team of specialists who are assessing the treatment regimens available.  He has completed a full body PET Scan and results will be forthcoming about the extent of any metastasis below his neck.  He had minor surgery March 26 to assist in the diagnosis and will again undergo surgery April 2 to install a chemotherapy port in his chest.  Daily radiation is planned for 6 to 7 weeks along with chemotherapy at various intervals.  Monday April 9th has been targeted for the beginning of radiation and chemo therapies. He has been told he will lose up to 80 pounds and it may become necessary for a feeding tube to be installed in his abdomen. Even at this point, before any treatment, he is in significant pain and is on measured amounts of morphine around-the-clock as well as hydrocodone.As you can imagine, Jim has quite a rocky road of therapy and healing ahead of him. The treatments and the side effects that go along with them dictate that he will have to cut back on much of his work during the next 6 to 8 months.  The oncologist has prepared him for a potentially longer period of adjustment as there are simply too many unknowns to be precise at this point.  Some of you are aware of Jim’s history of heart disease and heart attack and his success in overcoming of those trials.  Now he is facing the battle for his life.Between the expenses of the planned treatment and reduced capability to work, several of his friends have encouraged this GoFundMe campaign. You can imagine one of the many unrelenting stresses for Jim and Annette will be these questions: how can we go forward financially? With no disability insurance, how can we pay our bills? Can we afford the right therapies? Can we continue paying our insurance premiums?  Can we meet the ever-rising deductible? – the list is endless.Yet this is one area where we ALL can come together and help relieve some of these nagging concerns. With your donation we can let Jim & Annette focus on healing and living – and not waste precious emotional energy on finances. They have already begun steps to simplify their lives. Jim realizes this will be a defining life moment and will likely change the course of it. Simplicity will be good. So, they are making meaningful changes already:  they recognize the dire necessity of drastically cutting living expenses, including the possible sale of of their home in the future.  They have already begun to sell several possessions while at the same time assessing future work realities – all with an eye toward a healthier, less stressful, future.   Over the years they have been supportive, welcoming, friends to so many of us in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, Arkansas, and, of course, Memphis. As we all pray for the Father to bless Jim and Annette with healing, each of us also has an opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to relieve some of their concern in this most anxious time. You may support Jim & Annette with cards and well wishes sent directly to them through Facebook messenger.Thank you for supporting Jim & Annette with your continued prayers over this extended time. Scott MillsWinston-Salem, NC Blair BryanCharlotte, NC  ""Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

Your donations will immediately be used to pay for this genetic test that could determine the best course of action to treat her cancer. This will hopefully help get her back into class with her kindergarten kids, who she misses so much.  Kellie is and will be facing expensive medical bills in addition to her rent, car payments, insurance and other expenses.  She has never been one to ask for help unless it's absolutely necessary.  Any and all money received in this Go Fund Me account will be used for the current, pending, and future expenses not covered so she may continue to lead a semi-normal life while trying to get the treatment and help she needs.  In keeping with her love for kids, Kellie has determined any and all unneeded funds will be donated to St. Jude's Children's Hospital, so others even younger than she will also get the help they need and deserve.      Kellie, her family, and friends thank you in advance for all of your support.",366,1.1k,0,369,6 months,3 months ago,6 months,2018-09-03

I am a 44 year old mother of three children (JJ-5, Nyah-9, and Izzy-17). I need HELP!!! I’m trying to raise $300,000.000, half of which I  need ASAP for a deposit. I desperately need a surgery, Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, known as HIPEC. HIPEC is an up and coming surgery to treat different forms of abdominal cancers. I have a very rare and aggressive form of ADRENAL CANCER called Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC).  ACC is called a “Terrorist” cancer, an “Orphan” cancer. ACC is relentlessly aggressive and extremely rare. I have limited treatment options and very little time. I have been battling with ACC for 2 years. I am statistically approaching the end of my road. My Oncologist and I have exhausted every conventional form of treatment for my ACC. We started with surgery combined with radiation therapy and it returned in less than 2 months. After my recurrence in July of 2017, we hit it with almost a year of intense chemotherapy. A 3 chemo cocktail that has left me disabled and suffering from a pulmonary embolism. The embolism ended my remaining systemic chemo treatments. My tumors have responded well to the chemo, and there has been significant shrinkage, but the 4 tumors are still in the peritoneal lining of my abdomen. During HIPEC, what is left of my tumors will be removed, then Dr. Miller will apply heated chemo directly into my abdomen. I will be the very first ACC patient to be treated with HIPEC at the University of Michigan Cancer Center.  This treatment can give me years instead of months. Without this surgery, I will not live long enough to see my two youngest children finish grade school. I have insurance, my husband and I purchased our heath insurance through the ACA Marketplace, and I am grateful to the ACA. Without its protections for pre-existing conditions I wouldn’t have had the last 2 years with my family. Unfortunately, treatments provided out of network and out of state ARE NOT COVERED. Like I said before, my cancer is extremely rare and very aggressive, less than one in a million rare, and only three surgeons in the United States perform this surgery for ACC patients. I have started this Go Fund Me page because, like I said, my insurance won’t cover this cancer-busting procedure, and I am running out of time.With your help in funding this surgery, to be done by the ADRENAL CANCER research team at University of Michigan, HIPEC is my opportunity and small window to be with my family for hopefully many more years. I have hope, my family has hope, that I can actually beat this cancer, but soon the tumors will become too large and HIPEC will no longer be a viable option.  We are not a family to easily ask for help, but cancer changes your perspective on many things. Please help us by donating. Every little bit helps in a big way.FINANCIAL GOAL:Our financial goal is $300,000.00. A jaw dropping amount of money, but the surgery is expensive. Your donations in any amount will help cover the following:-Travel expenses between Phoenix, Arizona & Ann Arbor, Michigan-HIPEC Surgery, a 12-14 hour surgery-8 to10 days in the ICU and the hospital-Follow up visits for 2 weeks after my release from U of M, with my ACC specialist, Dr. Gary Hammer, and my surgeon, Dr. Barbra Miller. -Medication,Tests, and imaging-Accommodations for myself and my family for 4 to 5 week stay in Ann Arbor   -Paid help for me, and childcare for Nyah and JJ, as recovery is estimated at 6-9 months.",270,825,11,281,1 month,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I know, from private conversations, he truly looks at these kids and parents as extended family members.  He truly loves watching all kids succeed-not just his own.  Xiomara has opened up her home to many families throughout the year and has willingly picked up the duties at home when Fred was spending a great deal of time helping others.  Lani, Fred and Xiomara are in need of all of our help.  Many loved ones are offering support in many ways and the last week has been incredible to see in terms of how good people can be when a family is brought to their knees.   The financial cushion that we are trying to raise will allow Fred and Xiomara to focus on Lani without the stress of worrying about finances.Lani is an incredible  soccer player who has excelled on the field as well as in the classroom.  Her smile is infectious and her good natured spirit has touched many.  She will beat this illness and come back stronger than ever!!!",328,1.2k,11,326,10 days,2 days ago,9 days,2018-09-03

Subsequently, he required a lifesaving surgery where the doctors had to remove part of the skull to allow his brain to swell without causing any more damage. Currently he has limited movement on the left side of his body, but he was able to say his name and give his wife Cara a high five. He has a feeding tube but hopefully it will come out soon!!  The next step is at least 6 more weeks in the hospital, an intense couple of weeks of stroke therapy at an inpatient facility and most likely followed by an extended stay in a professional nursing facility where he will continue therapy until he is able to go home. We have a very long road ahead of us, but Jody has an AMAZING, MAGICAL, UNBELIEVEABLE group of friends and family that surrounds him.  With all that said, even with insurance medical bills can be a HUGE financial burden. From doctor’s bills, insurance co-pays, and LOST WAGES we are increasing our gofundme goal to go towards financial assistance to meet Jody’s family needs! We are grateful for all the donations so far. Even if you are not able to donate we ask you to share this link so others can help and share the love.  We cannot thank each and everyone of you enough.

I'm here to ask you for your prayers and help as Andrew begins his brave journey to fight and BEAT Burkitt's Leukemia. Just three weeks ago, Melissa and Chris took Andrew to their pediatrician to diagnose and treat a lump on the side of his face. After two rounds of antibiotics and several stumped doctors, Andrew was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Days later, a battery of tests confirmed that he has stage four blood cancer.  Andrew received the first of many upcoming chemo treatments on Friday, March 30. Because the cancer is aggressive, doctors have put him on a chemo treatment plan that will last six to eight months, with most of his  time being spent at CHOP. We are optimistic that at the end of Andrew's journey, he will stand tall, proud, victorious and ready to continue his life as a survivor. In order for Melissa and Chris to provide the full time care and love so critical to Andrew's healing process, they need to work reduced hours, thus immediately foregoing their full time salaries for the duration of Andrew's treatment and recovery. To help them cover the lost wages and Andrew's increasing costs of medical care, I am kindly asking for your generosity. Every thought, prayer, positive vibe, and contribution will help Andrew stay strong and WIN. On behalf of the Trouts, Branyans, Tieders, and Andrew's extended family, I sincerely thank you for your show of support and standing by Melissa, Chris and Andrew's brothers, Conner (eight) and William (five) during this trying time.

The funds will be spent for the medical bills that cannot covered by their insurance, recovery cost they need after surgery, to help with daily expenses until he is able to go back to work, to help to heal their hearts, to help to heal both physically and mentally distressed.

Many of you are personal friends of Faith and are familiar with her story and love her dearly. We absolutely need a miracle for Faith in the next couple of weeks. For those of you who have or have not followed Faith’s healing journey here’s what’s happening: Faith needs your financial help! There is nothing more that her Oncologist or Surgeon can do for her, she is in the lates stages of Stage 4 Mestatic Breast Cancer. Because it has already metastasized, ( spread to her spine ) It has the potential to spread very quickly to her major organs, it’s hard to say exactly how long she has. She is in the process of phasing our out of her job, as her health is seemingly declining. We don’t know how long she has, it could be just a series of months. Needless to say she is in need of a miracle. Faith has been accepted as a patient for experimental treatment at CHIPSA Hospital. This treatment will cost $33,427.17 This will cover 3 weeks of inpatient treatment, 3 meals a day, her own room, and covers the cost of an extra room and 3 meals a day for her travel companion. CHIPSA hospital has a lot of long standing integrity with Cancer.  https://chipsahospital.org/Faith has chosen this hospital because of the many first hand reports she has heard through the years in regard to their high results with cancer. CHIPSA has much higher results with cancer treatment for individuals with compromised immune systems........Of these Therapies are two in particular: IPT and the Vallovax Vaccine. IPT is low dose chemo assisted with Insulin, because cancer cells have more insulin receptors on them than healthy cells the chemo bypasses the healthy cells and only kills the cancer cells! Yay ! No hair falling out ! The Vallovax vaccine has received a lot of media coverage lately. 80-95% of clinical trials are seeing cancer patients with late stage disease with a clean bill of health, and with no side effects?! CHIPSAs hospital is only 23 miles south of sandiego, just over the border in Tiujuana. Faith has interviewed with her agent Kim, in addition to Dr Castillo her attending Physician. They have offered her 3 week opening available immediately. She has been approved for a comprehensive late stage cancer treatment program. She is most encouraged about the Vallovax Vaccine , it is anti angiogenic in nature and it is destroying cancer by: “reducing the growth of new blood vessels needed by tumors to grow and metastasize” It basically starves the tumors from their energy source and they die! The hospital is reporting that patients aren’t needing as much IPT because the Vallovax vaccine is having so much substantial success ! Overview- ( for those who need the back story) Faith was Diagnosed in July 2017 with stage 4 Breast Cancer. Faith’s White Blood cell count was dangerously low prior to starting any treatment. Her Oncologist says she has a condition called Leukopenia. This is where your white cell count is so low that even your own bodies bacteria can become dangerous to you. This makes Faith a risky candidate for chemo, Chemo greatly reduces your white blood cell count. Many people do not realize that it’s not the chemo that kills off the entirety of the cancer, it is the immune systems job to do so. I share this to clarify why Faith was never a candidate for typical Cancer therapy. Faith also has had a 9 year history of complicated auto immune diagnoses, there were years when she was so ill she couldn’t work. So now you have a better idea of why she needs to pursue this experimental treatment. Please consider donating or becoming a fundraiser yourself . If 350 people could find a way to raise 100$ from their friends and family , we could knock this out as quickly as possible and potentially save her life ! Sadly this is a life and death situation. We ask that everyone please share this post and more specifically if you would consider being a fundraiser yourself and gathering funds from you’re circle. If we get to the $35,000 mark Faith can go immediately...let’s get it done in three days and save her life!!",268,1.3k,5,303,2 months,4 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

There are only a few doctors and hospitals in the world that can, to this day,  perform the surgery because of its complexity.  Dr. Evan Zahn is his doctor (currently based in Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles)who together with Redmond Burke saved his life in1999. As a matter of fact, his condition was so rareback then and his odds for survival so low, that theMiami Herald published an article about him titled“A miracle of the Heart”. We gave everything forhim, not only emotionally, but also financially.Juan’s birth was supposed to be one of joy, the firstgrandson in our family. His mother was fully covered by insurance, but things changed radically when Juan was born with an undetected congenitaldisease. All of these medical procedureswere out of pocket expenses, since the insurancecompany denied coverage due to his congenitalcondition. After two open heart surgeries andseven catheterisms, plus the loss of sight in one of his eyes he needs another intervention.Two days ago we got the hospital’s quotation for his procedure. $89,000.00 We are not financially prepared for that and are turning to you to support us in finding themanner in which we might raise the necessary funds.  A child’slife, an amazing child’s life is at stake. We beg you, from our hearts,from my families’ and from our country of El Salvador’sprayers, where Juan has been an example of resilience, faithand hope, to help us. These funds will be used to paybfor his procedure  scheduled to bebon July 17 2018 Mi nombre es Adriana Hill y soy de El Salvador. Mi sobrino Juan Fernando Salaverria es un joven de 18 años que nació con Tetralogía de Fallo, ausencia de válvula pulmonar y de una arteria pulmonar. En la segunda semana de julio de este año debe de someterse a un cateterismo para poder reemplazar la válvula pulmonar que actualmente tiene. Solo hay un par de doctores en el mundo que actualmente realizan este procedimiento debido a su complejidad. El Dr. Evan Zahn es el doctor de Juan Fernando (actualmente trabaja en el Cedar Sinaí Hospital de Los Ángeles) quien junto con el Dr. Raymond Burke salvaron la vida de Juan Fernando en 1999. La condición con la que nació Juan Fernando era tan rara y su probabilidad de sobrevivir tan baja que el Miami Herald publicó un artículo sobre  llamado ""Un Milagro del Corazón"". Desde ese momento sus padres y el resto de su familia han dado todo para sacar adelante a Juan Fer no solo emocionalmente pero también  económicamente. Al momento de nacer, la mamá de Juan Fernando contaba con seguro médico, pero al ser la enfermedad de índole congénita, las cosas cambiaron drásticamente. Todos los procedimientos a los que se ha sometido Juan Fernando han sido pagados al 100% por la familia ya que la aseguradora le negó cobertura alguna. Después de dos cirugías de corazón abierto, siete cateterismos y la perdida completa de un ojo, Juan Fer necesita otra intervención. Hace unos días recibimos la cotización del hospital por el procedimiento $89,000.00.  No estamos preparados económicamente para esta situación por eso buscamos de su apoyo para encontrar la manera de poder ayudar a Juan Fernando. En nombre de nuestra familia agradecemos su apoyo, sus oraciones y su cariño para nuestro Juan Fer.

Medical,38,Strong for Rowan: Battling Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/Strong-for-Rowan,"LONG BEACH, CA","April 28, 2018","$40,000","$38,230","On behalf of Matthew Haynes, Abigail Haynes and family.This page is not intended solely for financial reasons. It may also serve as a platform for those to show love and support to baby Rowan and those who go above and beyond to care for him.  Those who choose to support through V E N M O: @mwhaynesOur fight with cancer: Our son, Rowan, was diagnosed with stage III Ganglioneuroblastoma at 15 months of age on March 2nd, 2018. An intermixed mass of cancerous and benign cells forming a tumor larger than a grapefruit was growing in his pelvis out toward his abdomen.  After two cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer was unresponsive and the only treatment left was surgery. On April 26th, the amazing surgical staff at Miller Children’s Hospital in Long Beach was able to perform a miracle. They took out 90% of the mass even though it was incasing his aorta and inferior vena cava. While considered overly successful, they could not safely remove the mass inside his spinal column and sacrum.Our fight isn’t over:  While the best possible outcome was achieved during surgery, our battle with cancer is far from complete. Depending on the type of tissue that still remains in his body and how well he recovers from surgery, he will still need a lot of treatment. He might need additional chemotherapy and maybe even radiation. Rowan will eventually need physical, occupational, and speech therapy to catch up on his milestones. Our oncology team estimates that his treatment will take anywhere from 6-12 months; we have been in the pediatric intensive care unit for only two months so far. As of April 28, 2018, he is still fighting hard in the surgical recovery stage of his treatment roadmap.Why we need your support: Plainly stated, we want to be able to ensure Rowan is being well taken care of. We also want to be able to support those who go out of their way to care for him. Rowan requires us to be by his side at all times in the hospital so we won’t be actively earning income. These donations will help us maintain his care and comfort. My awesome employer has given my family so much already, but those amazing benefits cannot last forever. All monies donated will be used for the treatment, care, comfort, and support of Rowan and those who care for him.For more detailed information on our son’s condition and treatment, scroll down for the whole story.The Haynes Family thanks you from the bottom of our hearts!Feel free to contact me at matthewhaynes@kpmg.com or mhaynes15@yahoo.com￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The Story: We took Rowan to our pediatrician on March 1st, 2018 because he was being extremely fussy during the past week. He wouldn’t eat, sleep, or crawl. Rowan would just whimper instead. We thought it was an ear ache and teething but our doctor was more concerned about how bloated his belly was. She ordered tests: blood, stool, and an ultrasound.  Later that evening around 7 o’clock, we got a call from her telling us to go to the ER because Rowan's lab results were extremely abnormal. Most notably, his calcium was >15mg/dL (Severe hypercalcemia). That trip to the ER would change our lives forever.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Soon after we get to the ER, an abdominal ultrasound revealed that he had a huge mass growing in his belly.  We were admitted to the Pediatric ICU. From there, as if almost on cue, he started to developed severe diarrhea. He would end up losing about 3 to 4 liters of stool everyday.  Confounded by what could be causing the stooling, the PICU team could only treat the extreme electrolyte imbalances and dehydration until the MRIs would reveal what was truly inside. After a week, the MRI was presented to us by the pediatric oncology team. The mass was a lot larger than expected and appeared to be growing from his sacrum to his belly button; it was 12x10x12cm. It was compressing his stomach and bladder, and pushing his intestines toward his ribs. Tumor and bone marrow biopsies needed to be taken in order to give us a definitive diagnoses. Our worst fears came to fruition.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The diagnosis was Ganglioneuroblastoma: Stage III Cancer.  It is a very rare cancer that has benign and malignant growths intermixed. The cancer was also emitting a hormone (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) that caused him to have severe diarrhea; even if he had nothing to eat or drink, he would still have watery stool. At the time, the edpidemiologists thought the dysentery was from a contagious disease, so Rowan was put on isololation for most of the time. In essence, he was forced to stay in his crib for weeks, which was horrible. The diarrhea posed a huge challenge because it resulted in Rowan having his blood tested every four hours so that they could replace his electrolytes and fluids. Eventually, he had to have a semi-permanent central line placed under his collar bone for easy access to blood and meds. He also had a feeding tube inserted through his nostril.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The plan of attack was to have two cycles of chemotherapy then check to see if the tumor had shrunk. Surgery would have been the first option but the surgical team was worried that the tumor was too vascular (bloody) and chemotherapy would hopefully kill some of the vasculature.  So, we treated the cancer with two rounds. A total of 42 days worth of inpatient therapy in the pediatric oncology ward. Eventually, Rowan's instability would bring us back to the Pediatric ICU where we would call home for most of the stay. They treated him as well they could.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼After the first round of chemotherapy, preliminary signs indicated that the tumor was not shrinking and everything we did to slow the stooling wasn't working. We continued to give his second round of chemotherapy with different drugs to ensure that we covered all angles. After many blood transfusions, anti-nausea/pain medications, and diaper changes later, we finally take another MRI to see the results of chemo. In short, the results were not good. The MRI indicated that the tumor was unresponsive and actually grew just a few CMs. This was a hard pill to swallow. What was even more devastating was the MRI revealed that the tumor mass was incasing the two main arteries from the heart. The tumor was also being fed blood by three other arteries. This news was devastating to us. The only bright side was that flu restrictions were lifted and Rowan’s big sister, McKenzie, got to see him for the first time after two months.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The remaining treatment was surgery; to get as much of the mass out of him as possible. The problem was that removing the mass could be lethal and that only 50% could be taken out safely.  On April 26, 2018 Rowan endured a 6.5 hour surgery that required every pediatric surgeon in the hospital. We were told that 5 surgeons worked simultaneously on him. We were blessed and relieved that a miracle was performed that day and 90% of the tumor was removed. Everyone's prayers and support and love and kindness were answered. Tears of joy were shed by family, nurses, and doctors alike that day. But our battle is far from over. Only a few days into his recovery we are seeing the struggle that remains. He has a long road ahead with treatment to follow. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼We will keep you all updated!Thank you from the very bottom of our hearts.",408,546,32,405,4 months,18 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

They could not figure out why and did a spinal surgery thinking that was it. She kept getting weaker and had a fall in Dec 2016, breaking her ankle in three places. In early 2017, she continued losing mobility and by September she could no longer stand. In September, they finally gave us the diagnosis but it was definitely not what we were hoping for...it is ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). They say the average lifespan from the first symptoms is 2-4 years and we can definitely see the progression as she is almost bed bound 24/7. But Mary is still dedicated to trying to ‘Stephen Hawking‘ the crap outta this!The cost of paying for a full time caregiver is pretty incredible and we are still on the waiting list to get Medicare to pay for some of it. In addition to Mary's healthcare costs, she has started her inevitable decline, being mostly bedbound every day, losing the use of even her hands, and now her voice is becoming difficult to understand clearly. She also is needing respiration in order to sleep and keep oxygen flowing properly.  Ted has to work during the day to keep the ship afloat.  And after buying a handicapped van in October, the medical expenses are starting to mount again for us.If you are in a position to help, it is super appreciated.  We are thankful that we have a full lifetime to remember together.  Living in London, helping her get into Stanford, working at our startup GoTo together, years of watching our kids grow up. Now that she has pretty much only her memories left, we are dedicated to helping her as much as we are able. Thank you her friends and family for all of the laughter and memories.  Mary is dedicated to helping others even in this difficult time - and we've put together a blog with all her lists of life tips .  Check it out!You can also check out this amazing video that a close friend had made at our Team Mary party.  It's a very touching way to see how Mary has touched all our lives.Sending love from Mary.",74,22,3,73,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

This time it has come back as a mass on the outside of her lung, causing her intense pain due to all the nerve endings in that area of the body. The doctors believe that it is is localized to that area, but are recommending some rather intensive chemotherapy options as well as large scale surgeries to get her back to her healthy. Although it hurts feeling like we cannot do anything to help her, there actually is a means of assistance.... By supporting her through this fundraiser and sharing this with your network, this will tremendously help her by allowing her parents and loved ones provide all the accommodations for her through this process. There will be many medical costs to get her through this.

In January, Laura’s scans showed that there was no evidence of disease. Despite this, Laura was adamant that another scan be taken in mid-August to confirm that she was cancer free. While doctors noted an additional scan wasn’t needed, her persistence won and the scan was performed.As a shock to us all, on August 23, 2018 Laura and Michael received the devastating news that the scan showed a concerning spot on her liver. Laura’s doctors are confident that this lesion signifies a recurrence of her cancer and therefore, at the beginning of September, Laura will have the lesion removed and sent out for testing. This recurrence would put her at stage 4 cancer which means that more creative methods need to be put into place to ensure Laura has the strongest possibility to beat this. So many people have reached out to show their love and support, and to ask about ways they can help. This Go Fund Me Page is a way to help Laura and Michael access the care, resources, and lifestyle they need to give them all the strength to continue to fight like hell. Beyond cancer being devastating, it is expensive. Insurance will cover the scans, the surgeries, etc. but ALL other supplementary expenses are out of pocket. New costs pop up every day, but here is what we know they can expect soon. Those costs that are known for certain are listed below, however there are some costs we are not exactly sure of yet. Western Medicine- COBRA costs due to Laura carrying the insurance prior to the loss of her job earlier this year ($1600/month)- Flights to and from hospitals for second opinions, treatment, etc. (airline tickets will cost at least $300 each time they travel, not including hotel costs and other costs associated with being away from home)- Research on her lesion performed by Foundation One (a sample of her lesion will be sent out for testing to determine the type of cancer she is dealing with so she can best fight it)- Functional medicine expenses - A consult Dr. Nasha Winters who uses natural medicine to target stage 4 cancer successfully ($500 for just the consult, not including ongoing treatment) Eastern Medicine- Acupuncture 2x a week ($31 each session)- Natropath doctor visits twice a month ($200 each visit)- A treatment facility to focus on detoxification and finding the root cause of her cancer (approx. $10K, depending on the facility)- Research by Sator Therapeutics – Cost is TBD but likely in the thousands (this is a personalized approach to treatment in Europe that would allow Laura to receive a customized treatment based on her specific type of cancer)  - Additional exploratory medicine expenses that arise (This will be the driving cost of treatment going forward as Laura needs to determine the root cause of her cancer and be vigilant in her approach to treatment)- Mistletoe injections ($180 monthly)Lifestyle- Regular massage treatments ($40 each session)- Organic groceries weekly in lieu of a meal train or other meals dropped off ($200) – Laura is on a very strict diet and this will allow her to maintain it- Supplements ($180 a month)Despite the stage 4 diagnosis, Laura and Michael are confident that they can beat this. People live for many years and go into remission with this diagnosis, but this type of success requires a lot of work, exploration, alternative medicine, and the expenses that go along with it all. This Go Fund Me page will help to ensure that Laura and Michael can focus on her treatment and have relief from some of the expenses that will come their way in the future Following the removal of this mass in early September, we will know, for certain, if this is cancerous. Because the doctors believe it is, we would like to give Laura and Michael a jump start on the upcoming expenses. If, for some reason, the results of the test indicate that this mass is not cancerous, all funds will be refunded Thank you in advance for your generosity, love, and support.",338,499,0,337,7 days,6 days ago,6 days,2018-09-03

Medical,39,Adaptive van for Nick,https://www.gofundme.com/VanforNick,"SNOHOMISH, WA","July 3, 2018","$35,000","$37,785","Please help Nicholas' family afford a van so he can be safely transported when they need to leave the home.Adaptive vans are needed to  safely transport medically complex and physically disabled people to and from doctor’s and therapy appointments. It also helps them have the ability to experience life outside of the home. Nicholas is a two year old deeply affected by cerebral palsy. He can't do things like sit up without assistance, lift his arms or push up to help those caring for him move him from place to place. He's a tall boy for his age and the risk of injury is high for both him and caregivers. Getting a van with the right equipment will help transfer him more safely than out of a car seat in a typical vehicle. Kids like Nick have bulky, heavy medical equipment, and if it's not used as intended, expensive repairs are needed. This happens when components that aren't intended to be broken apart need to be in order to fit into a car to go to multiple appointments, sometimes in the same day. Nick's family has some important visits to the Seattle Children's Hospital scheduled later in the summer with  specialists and they have to bring equipment that doesn't fit in their car.Nick's family will soon be selling their small SUV and hope to buy an adaptive van, but they need your help.RECENT VISIT TO DEALER TO SEE HOW NICK'S CHAIR FITSThis is Nick's story, told by his Mom and Dad:In June of 2016, my husband and I received a phone call that a little boy was born many states away to an unprepared mother and that the baby needed a family. We had been chosen for the task if we could quickly decide to take him. After a surprisingly short discussion and a long flight to meet him, it was obvious that Nick was meant to be our son. Because we had gotten him ""overnight"", our community rallied around us and started delivering clothing, strollers, a crib; almost everything we needed showed up miraculously at our doorstep in those early days.A few short months later, our perfect baby started to slip in meeting milestones and started exhibiting what medical professionals called ""hypertonicity"". He was unable to turn his head easily to the left and his leg and arm muscles were consistently tight. He also started having issues bottle feeding and he barely slept. The hardest part about the first few months was not knowing what was happening with him and feeling like we weren't giving him what he needed. Typical new parents, right? What we didn't know at that time is that Nick's brain had suffered a stroke early on in the pregnancy and he had a condition called bilateral schizencephaly  with polymicrogyria . When we received his diagnosis at 6 months of age, we were told that he probably wouldn't walk and that controlling his seizures and muscle tone would be life-saving as he grew.NICK'S FIRST EEG, WHERE HIS SEIZURE DISORDER WAS CONFIRMEDThe first year of his life was deeply disorienting for us and filled with hospital admissions, trips to the ER, trials and errors with feeding tubes, procedures, tests, sleepless nights and mastering a whole new vocabulary. We learned the difference between OT and PT, balanced appointments in the home and in-clinic and we signed him up for every service we could afford, leveraging the Early Intervention's Birth to 3 services. As his mother, I was unable to return to work and filled my time with going to support groups, hiring dependable caregivers and even attending seminars about neuroplasticity. Kids like Nick need help re-wiring the brain to use their muscles, including those supporting vision, so they can have hope for some sort of ""normal"" life.NICK AFTER HIS FIRST MEDICAL PROCEDURE TO GET A FEEDING TUBE, HELD BY DADAs symptoms of his brain disorder, Nick has cerebral palsy, intractable epilepsy, cortical vision impairment and other symptoms like trouble swallowing and digesting food. He doesn't use any words to communicate. He's followed by over 15 doctors and we see 6 therapists - Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Vision Therapists - either weekly or monthly either in our home or in clinics.What my husband's health insurance doesn't cover has been paid out of pocket so far. Big expenses are looming because he's such a big boy and because he can't help us move him at all.  Expensive things like adding tracks in the ceiling to support his weight as we move him safely from one room to an adaptive bathroom - not yet built - or removing steps and replacing them with ramps to roll his chair. We need to find a space in home to accommodate durable medical equipment like his activity chair, an adaptive stroller or foam wedges to support him during vision therapy. He'll soon get a ""stander"" to help him bear weight so his hips can develop enough to avoid surgery.TWO OF THE PIECES OF LARGE EQUIPMENT WE NEED TO TRANSPORTThe tricky thing about medical equipment is that it's bulky and heavy. Not only do we need to protect our bodies as he grows but we need to protect the integrity of the equipment by not breaking it down when it needs to go with him to appointments. The retail cost of one of his pieces of equipment alone is over $7,000 and if it breaks, there are limited options for loaners. The process of getting the blue chair in the picture above through the local children's hospital, including insurance approvals, took almost 7 months!We've waited as long as possible to buy an adaptive van to safely transport Nick and his heavy medical equipment. Soon, he won't sit in a car seat and instead, his chair will be strapped down inside a van for transport. By purchasing a properly adapted one, we'll be able to roll Nick into it and reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the chairs. If you have ever shopped for a van, you know that they can be costly. If you add the conversion package, the cost is between $60,000 to $80,000 for a new one. The conversion offers essential features for families like ours, like:-    A wheelchair ramp that automatically retracts from the vehicle after the van is lowered closer to the ground. You might have seen this with buses being lowered to accommodate a passenger with physical limitations. -    Modular seating that can be easily removed to add space for large equipment or a disabled passenger in the front when they're old enough. Why should a person who would typically ride up front be pushed to the back of a van simply because they can't open a door and sit in the front seat?-    Illumination on the floors to see where you're working on tying down chairs or when you drop things like syringes while meds are administered.We've been setting aside money to buy the van but other expenses are adding up:  adapting our home, hiring additional caregivers so we can both work to afford therapies and treatments. So, we're asking for some help. We're lucky to have a fair, family-run and owned local dealership  in our area but we really need some help putting part of the money down to be able to afford the monthly payment.It's very hard to ask for help so publicly but we've been encouraged to do so by some of his doctors and therapists and we all need help from time to time.Thank you listening to our family's story and for your support. Even if you can't contribute financially, sharing our story with your friends and family or leaving a kind note is always appreciated. You can share the link by email, phone, Facebook or Twitter:   www.gofundme.com/VanforNick. Or, you can just use"" share buttons"" and mention why Nick's story inspired you to donate or share.Thank you again,Nick's Mom and Dad, Nick J.",306,1.1k,17,302,2 months,12 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

The next day, she suffered from a 104-degree fever, a headache, nausea, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was taken to urgent care, where they eventually couldn’t find a blood pressure, and then she was rushed to the emergency room.Somehow, Diane had contracted an infection during the sinus surgery that had quickly become septic(bacterial infection in blood stream). She was taken into an emergency surgery, where her entire large colon and part of her small bowel were removed. She then spent almost two weeks in the ICU, unable to see her sons, and was taken back to surgery for an illeostomy and given a feeding tube (peg) as well. She wasn’t able to speak again until she was extubated on June 17th—her first words were, ""Happy Father's Day.""Because the infection became septic so drastically, Diane no longer has use of her fingers and feet, but she can currently stand briefly on her left foot. She struggles through having her wounds dosed with alcohol, wrapped, and unwrapped multiple times a day. She is also still suffering from a swollen small intestinal area with gas and stomach pains, a clogged feeding tube, anxiety, and minimal sleep. She is enduring physical therapy trying to regain mobility with hopes of returning home to her boys, husband, and the community that she knows and loves.The doctors are advising amputation. There is a possibility of hand transplants and a right below-the-knee amputation, as well as an partial amputation on her left foot. The doctors are also hopeful that more can be done to improve her small intestine, bar any more infections or setbacks. However, most of the above won’t be covered by her insurance or social security. The current estimate for what she’d have to pay out of pocket is over $500,000.The insurance will pay to put Diane in a nursing home, but refuses to pay for at-home health care, prosthetics, or the necessary procedures. The worst case would be Diane being placed in a nursing home at 35 years old, where she could only get visitation from her boys and husband after school and work, but would no longer be able to live with them. The family has yet to hear back from Medicaid, but we’re hoping that Diane will be accepted so that she and her sons can have some insurance if she were no longer to have insurance from her job due to her condition.We are asking for donations to this GoFundMe page to help pay off her medical bills that the insurance won’t cover, and for the ability to receive any prosthetics or at-home care she’s going to need moving forward.Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance for anything you can give.  Any little bit will help, even something as small as the price of a cup of coffee.  Please share to spread the word even if you can’t help monetarily!We thank God for His many blessings and that Diane is alive and can still hug her boys with her arms and talk to them. Through this whole ordeal her faith in God and multiple prayer group-support from Open Door Church, where she volunteers and where her boys to go to school and support has been a tremendous help. We thank everyone who has prayed and for the many churches across North Carolina, her family, and her friends that have gotten her this far.All funds raised will be withdrawn in a special bank account on behalf of Diane and the family.  Paula Loftin will work to oversee the withdrawals of the funds.",345,2.3k,15,338,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

As of this new posting, we have collectively raised about $32,000 to support our longtime friend and favorite bartender in his most challenging year. I am happy to have spent a couple of days with Nasso this past week in the beginning of August, around and in my swimming pool, a scenario neither of us could have imagine even two weeks ago. It is a convenient place for him to begin a long process of rehab in tandem with his other physical therapy routines. He is in good spirits but still trying to process all the life changing events that have occurred these past 9 months.The good news about his bone marrow biopsy being negative was a big deal of course. He is still waiting on an additional report regarding the possible presence of an aberrant “t” cell that would make him more vulnerable in the future. Fingers crossed.In any case, Nasso will not be rejoining the work force anytime soon. The neuropathy in his legs, a direct result of the extensive chemotherapy, have disabled him. His once powerful arms and hands will need a lot of time and determination to recover. He has always been a physical guy and is ready and thankful to be able to get after it.Nasso is more than grateful for this Go Fund Me site. Our initial goal has been reached. But the future is still very uncertain for him. Up until now, Rancho Nicasio was able to cover his health insurance. He now has to rely on COBRA, which costs around $800 a month.

She faced  this horrible disease 4 1/2 years ago and beat it, but on March 20th was given the heartbreaking news that it had returned. A lot has changed since Kendall's first battle with cancer. She got married, became a mother to my beautiful granddaughter, Sofia, and has continued her career. Kendall first noticed a lump under her arm about a month ago and immediately contacted her oncologist. He ordered a PET scan to check for any tumors she might have and also ordered a needle extraction biopsy. After the results of both tests were in, it was confirmed that the Hodgkin's Lymphoma was back.  She has a key lime sized tumor in her armpit, an orange sized tumor next to her heart and a small tumor under her collarbone. Kendall had a central line (port) surgically implanted in her chest on March 28th. This is how the chemo will be administered to her during treatment. Kendall will undergo 9 weeks of aggressive outpatient chemo in her hometown of Medford, Oregon starting next week. As soon as the chemo is complete she will undergo another PET scan to confirm that the chemo has killed the tumors. Next, Kendall will be moved to Portland, Oregon to get an even more aggressive chemo that will be given to her over 6 consecutive days. We were told she can expect the side effects from this treatment to be the harshest of anything she has faced to date, and will certainly cause her to lose her hair. Then the final and most brutal treatment will happen immediately after. The final treatment is a full bone marrow transplant that will remove all of Kendall's bone marrow, treat it with medication and her own stem cells and then return it to her body. This treatment will happen over a 4 week period and will put her white blood cell count at zero. Kendall's body will not have the ability to fight off even the weakest germs so this will be a very delicate time for her and our family. Kendall will be isolated from everyone except for her mother and I, who will care for her during the treatment and the 2 week recovery.  This will be a very rough time for her as she won't be able to have any contact with Sofia during this time.The funds we raise for her will be used to cover all of the outrageously expensive medical costs before, during and after her treatment that we already know her insurance won't cover. It will also be used for travel expenses to and from Portland, the 6 week housing for Kendall during the bone marrow transplant and recovery, and help with living expenses while Kendall is unable to work, which may be as long as 6 months. Kendall's husband Fily is working hard as a full time nursing student which makes it impossible for him to work at this time, so Kendall is the sole provider for her new family.For all of you that know me, this is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I am a person that loves to give to others but at the same time find it so hard to ask for help, but this is an urgent situation. So from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of my entire family, I thank you for any support you can give.  Please share this link and continue to pray for my angel, Kendall Joy.",113,366,2,120,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

When my oncologist told us that our best hope is flying to Switzerland for treatment, we decided to say yes without knowing how we would pull it off. It almost reminds me of the “trust fall,” where you fall backwards and believe that someone will be back there to catch you. In this case, our family, friends and a lot of people who we don’t even know not only caught us, but lifted us up more than we can believe. The amount of funds raised in a matter of hours and days was stunning. I never would have believed that we’d have this kind of response, especially after many of you have already given to us in the past. It seems like every day on every television channel and every internet story, we are told how divided we are in this country for a variety of reasons. To me - this has been the ultimate reminder that people really are good. A large community that is united by compassion and kindness has lifted us up when we needed it the most. A community, by the way, made up of people in many states, several countries, men and women, straight and gay, Republicans and Democrats, young and old, etc. It will be impossible for us to ever thank this community of kindness in a way that feels like enough. But from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate what each one of you has done for us. Whether it was a donation, sending us a dinner, saying a prayer, giving a hug on a tough day, or just being a friend, this community has meant everything to us - and I thank you. We will do our very best to pay your kindness forward in as many ways as we can in the future.So here we are - in Switzerland. I will be admitted into the hospital tomorrow morning, and will stay until Thursday. I want this treatment to be successful for the obvious reasons, but I also feel some strange pressure to make all of your support worth it. I know that’s a little crazy, but I don’t want to let everyone down. Once I’m injected with the isotope, I will literally be radioactive. Nobody (including Anne) will be able to be around me for a day and a half. People experience a wide range of side effects, so I’m not sure what to expect. I’m both excited about the treatment and also already nervous about the future results. We will keep you posted on how it goes. Thanks again and I love you all!-ScottUPDATE:**Thanks to your generosity, we were able to meet our initial goal in less than a day!! Since the interest in helping has been so high, we will continue and any additional funds will go towards Scott’s second and third treatments that will come to a total of $36,000.  We are overwhelmed by the response and I know that Scott and Anne are as well. **Our brother Scott continues his courageous battle with cancer.  With his wife Anne and son Alec by his side, he has fought every day.  His best option for treatment at this point takes them to Switzerland.  We are hoping to raise enough to help him pay for his first treatment and anything additional will go toward subsequent treatments (he has to go 3 times).   We want them to be able to focus on getting the best treatment he can and enjoying every day without worrying about medical and traveling costs.  When we approached Scott about additional fundraising, he finally agreed but only if we would add a personal letter to you all.  We have attached the letter below.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  As a family, we appreciate all your support.Renee & MichelleHi Friends and Family,First, we want to thank all of you who have offered to set up a fundraising site for us. We have agreed to let my sisters create one, but felt like we needed to tell everyone why. Since my diagnosis, we have gotten so much support.  People have set up fundraisers for us over the last few years.  There were times when we thought we had been given way too much and would eventually need to donate it to a non-profit.   However, this journey turned out to be more challenging (and more expensive) than we realized.    Our eyes are now wide-open to healthcare in America, and people with rare diseases are really in a tough spot. Luckily, we have you.  Trust me, without you all I might not be here today.  And if I were, we certainly would not still be living in our house or be able to send Alec to daycare.   We cannot thank everyone enough for all of the prayers and support.  We absolutely could not do it without you.   Up until now I have been able to see the best specialists in the country at MD Anderson in Texas and James Cancer Center in Ohio.  I have tried several clinical trials, but the cancer has continued to act very aggressively.   All of the specialists agree that my best chance now is a full body radiation procedure called PRRT.   It is an amazing treatment that can target all of the bone tumors in my body (I have many, many of them now).  It has been approved by the FDA for the more common types of neuroendocrine cancers, but not for mine.  Since insurance does not cover anything not approved by the FDA – we’re out of luck.  Believe it or not, it is less expensive to go to another country and pay out of pocket for the procedure than it is to get it here at the hospital in Pittsburgh without help from insurance.   We have made the decision to go to Basel, Switzerland to get the first round of PRRT.  The first treatment alone will be $12,000 (there are 3 treatments overall, 10 weeks apart), and there will obviously be significant travel expenses.  The cost is high, and it was not an easy decision for me, but I feel like no matter what happens, Alec has to know that I did everything that I possibly could to spend more time with him.  And besides, I haven’t given up yet. And I don’t plan on it.   We want you to know that you have already done your part.   Nobody should feel like they need to contribute again.  We love you all so much for everything that you have already done and nothing will change that.   We agreed to this because many are asking what else they can do, and honestly – we need some help.  Not counting the trip(s) overseas, the costs of endless appointments, prescriptions and travel add up quickly.  It has been very humbling to go from a life where we never had to worry about finances, to a place where we have to admit that we can’t do it on our own.  We can only say that your thoughts, prayers, kindness and support have meant everything to us and we’ll do everything that we can to pay it forward when we are able.

The have 6 amazing kids. Hallie-15 Olivia-14 Luke-11 Lincoln-10 Emma-6 and Bo-3. This is no ordinary family. You can find the Smith’s constantly serving others, always having fun but most of all, they are always together. You will not find better kids or more devoted parents. In the fall of 2017, Jodi was diagnosed with stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. After months of difficult chemotherapy treatments and one major surgery, Jodi received a clean bill of health. A true miracle.About a week after her clean scans, Jodi packed up the kids and headed to Utah for a family-filled summer with the kiddos. Casey stayed home to work with plans to meet up with the family at a later date. A few days into the trip, Jodi received a phone call that Casey had collapsed and had two seizures while helping a friend move. Jodi caught a plane in the middle of the night to be by Casey’s side. Casey was diagnosed with Glioblastoma multiforme. An inoperable tumor in the brain. Casey will receive radiation and chemotherapy as treatment as this tumor does not yet have a cure.To know the Smith family is to love them. The Smith kids are incredible examples, faithful as can be and righteous in all they do. Plus, they are fun-loving, hilarious and love each other deeply. To say they’ve had more than their fair share is an understatement but they persevere and continue to choose the right. It is absolutely amazing how these kids have handled the cards that have been dealt to them with both of their parents being diagnosed with cancer. It’s a true testament of good values and a strong family unit.We’ve set up this account to hopefully provide some relief to their family at this time but also because so many people have asked to help. We are truly grateful for all the people who have rallied together and lifted this incredible family up by serving, sending texts, calling, helping with the kids, providing meals, serving others but most of all praying. We’ll continue to pray, pray, pray as we support the Smith’s and Casey.  #smithstrong",276,1.0k,0,267,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He chalked it up to the flu, since it was rampant around town. From the moment he arrived at the ER, his life took a turn that none of us could have ever imagined. Chris didn’t have the flu. Chris was septic. The procedure he had caused a Strep A infection in his blood that traveled throughout his entire body and all of the sudden he was fighting for his life. Chris experienced multiple organ failure, was intubated (on a ventilator), on dialysis and a team of doctors did all they could to save his life. The next few weeks in the Intensive Care Unit proved to be devastating. Chris went thru endless tests with rounds of doctors trying to stabilize his condition. After being intubated for over 2 weeks, doctors chose to perform a tracheotomy so that he could breathe without a tube in his voice box and to reduce the likelihood of infection.Chris had been through the ringer. His body had just barely survived multiple organ and acute heart failure. Then, he couldn’t move his arms or legs. Like many ICU patients who are that close to death, Chris was diagnosed with Critical Illness Neuropathy/Myopathy. This news was beyond anything we were expecting. The Neurologist said that in the 30 years he has been practicing he has never seen such a severe case. He said it may be months or years before Chris will be able to move again, from his neck down. He is not able to breathe on his own, nor able to speak. He is fed through a feeding tube to his stomach.The doctors announced on March 20th that the best course at this time to take would be to transfer Chris to a Long Term Care Facility and out of ICU, where he has now been for the past month. Chris may require professional care for a long time, perhaps the rest of his life.Chris and his wife own a wonderful CPA practice that they acquired after his wife’s step father passed away almost 2 years ago and they were gifted his business. This is their ONLY source of income. They have 2 little girls, ages, 1 ½ and 3 1/2. The financial burden on this family is overwhelming and they will not be able to take on all of the financial responsibilities alone.Our hope and prayer is for Chris to recover and one day regain mobility for independent living. Chris is well known by friends & family for his smile, charm and dedication to wife and children. His family gives heartfelt thanks for the love and kindness they have received to date. Please help support Chris in his time of need! This will help his family with medical expenses and rehabilitation.With love,His Family",294,935,10,299,5 months,12 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

About a month later, Amy began to experience numbness/paralysis on her left side and face.  Amy went through a whirlwind of misdiagnoses and treatments, including MS treatments that led to a severe allergic reaction. Sadly, after biopsy confirmation, she was diagnosed with brain cancer.  In 2013-2014 Amy underwent months of chemotherapy, radiation and then eventually surgery to remove her original brain tumor and miraculously has been cancer free for the past 4 years.  Amy remained paralyzed on her left side from the original tumor but was otherwise able to lead a normal, happy life and mother her children as they have grown.  Sadly, about 9 months ago she started experiencing dizziness and a decline in speech and mobility that has continued to worsen and included a hospital stay in December for pneumonia.  Amy has been unable to speak and walk since August and the burden of care for herself and her four children has been on her family and, in particular, her amazing husband Sean.  We hope to raise funds to help pay for services, medical costs and other unexpected costs.

She was able to return to work doing what she loves and caring for those in need. After a routine checkup later that year, a small spot was discovered in her left lung and thus began another round of chemo.  Three months of treatment and things were looking hopeful. Even when the chemo was leaving her exhausted she pushed through caring for those at work and home. Then devastating news came end of June this year when she went in for her 3 month checkup.

Not only did he have leukemia, but he learned at just 23 years old, that he had two types of leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since that day he has beaten all odds to be here with us today. He has had a bone marrow transplant, hip replacement, neurological issues and countless other trials. Any complication and side effect that could come from the transplant, chemo, medications, etc., it seemed like Tripp would fall victim. Today is no different. His current battle is due to Graft vs. Host Disease of the lungs.  Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD) of the lungs is caused by the new blood cells in his body, from the bone marrow transplant (the graft), attacking his lungs (the host).  GVHD can usually be controlled with different medicines, but in his case, the damage to his lungs was too severe before it was brought under control.   This caused irreparable damage to his lungs.  Despite many treatment plans, he is now at the point of requiring a double lung transplant.  Due to Tripp’s medical history caused by the leukemia and complications related to treating that disease, there are a limited number of facilities that would even consider him for transplant.  Duke University Hospital is the largest lung transplant program in the Southeast taking on more difficult cases like Tripp’s.  

Over 4 and half years ago, I saw my dad cry for the first time. I am starting this GoFundMe page to help four of the most important people in my life: my brother, my mother, my father, and my brother’s fiancé, Christine. In just a few weeks, my brother, mother (as his required caretaker), and Christine are temporarily relocating to Durham, North Carolina so Tripp can start the lung transplant program at Duke University Hospital. They will be in Durham for up to one year while Tripp receives and then heals from his lung transplant.  Although Tripp does have medical insurance, it doesn’t cover all the medical attention and therapy he will require pre-transplant and post-transplant. They will also have relocation, rent and living expenses for up to one year – none of which are covered by insurance.  This next year will be a very trying time for him, my mother, Christine and my father - as he will have to stay in Florida.

I am asking for your support to help my brother through this difficult time and to reduce the financial stress on my family. Any little bit helps, and we are beyond grateful for any generosity you are willing to give. In addition to any financial generosity, we ask for your prayers. God has already delivered Tripp through more complications than you could imagine. God is faithful and we are trusting in Him.",374,1.2k,0,368,9 days,7 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Back Story 

I had been having chest and back pain for quite a while. In October 2017, I was admitted to the hospital and tests showed a mass in my right lung. 

A biopsy in November showed it was benign. Since it wasn't cancer and surgery to remove it would mean months out of work, we decided to try to shrink the mass with medication. Unfortunately, the pain didn't get better. As the months went by, it got worse and worse. It got to the point where I couldn't sleep and I was coughing up blood. 

In June of this year, I went to St. Luke's emergency room and was admitted for many, many tests. My pet scan showed ""activity"" in two different areas of my lung, plus a muscle under my ribcage. Alarmingly, the original mass had grown a great deal in a short time. Doctors performed multiple biopsies. 

Diagnosis 

On July 9, my wife and I were given news that shocked us to our core: I have cancer. Spindle cell sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects bone, muscle, and connective tissue. Sarcoma is difficult to treat under the best of circumstances, but when it has spread like mine has, the prognosis is much worse. 

Treatment 

Conventional doctors are recommending chemotherapy to try to shrink the largest mass before removing it and a large portion of my right lung, and then possibly radiation. All of these treatments are expensive and painful. Worse, their success rate against cancer like mine is low. 

A Safer Alternative

I have researched and found a clinic in Mexico that has successfully treated sarcoma using nutritional therapy and other treatments, such as: 
*Oxygen therapy 
*Rife therapy 
*Biomagnetic therapy 
*Regenerative cell therapy 
*Low-dose chemotherapy 
*Hyperthermia 

Costs 

A 3-week treatment plan at the clinic costs $22,000. However, difficult cases may take 6 weeks or longer to treat. In addition, I won't be able to work during that time. Since I'm self-employed, I won't be getting sick pay or vacation pay, and I'll still have all of the usual household expenses to pay. 

What Your Donation Is Doing (8/21/18)

I have already stayed the initial 3 weeks ($22,000), plus an extra week ($7,300). I was unexpectedly hospitalized for a week (versus the usual outpatient care), which was an additional $2,800. After learning that one of the tumors had grown, we decided to fight it with stem cell/bone marrow treatment, which costs $3,500. Now we are seeing signs that my tumor is dying, but it looks like I will need at least one more week of treatment ($7,300).

How You Can Help 

My journey with this disease has just begun, but with the grace of God and your generosity, I'm determined to beat it. Please donate whatever you can. I understand times are tough for a lot of people, but even $5 will help me get the treatment that can save my life. I'm grateful for every penny. Please help me see my daughters reach adulthood. Help me see my 4 children get married. Help me one day see my grandchildren. 

Help me fight. Help me live. Please share my link  with your family and friends:  https://www.gofundme.com/SamFightsCancer Feel free to post it to Facebook or Twitter.

She lost her hearing several months ago and eventually was not able to breath out of one of her nostrils. We figured that it was some type of a chronic sinus infection. After receiving antibiotics and it didn't improve Moana's provider sent her in to get a CT scan. After the results came back they asked her to do a biopsy. When the results came back we found out that she has NPC. It is a rare form of cancer here in the United States but is more common in other countries and seem to show up a lot in people that are Chinese. The Dr. put a tube in her ear and now she can hear but still can't breath out of her nostril. But she is so positive that she has been celebrating her hearing returning. We found a few places across the US that perform surgery to remove these tumors. We decided that Stanford would be the right fit for Moana. Once we sent in all of the imaging, we found out that she was not a candidate for surgery because the tumor was too big. However, after going through the process we felt like Stanford was still the right place for her to receive chemotherapy and radiation. We will be meeting with the specialists that will be doing her chemotherapy and radiation next week and will have a much more clear understanding of how long the treatments will last. Based on other patients and estimates, it will most likely be roughly six weeks of radiation everyday Mon-Fri but I'm not sure yet how often and when she will receive the chemotherapy treatments. Stanford will be a little far from home and it isn't the most convenient place to get in and out of but after the research that we did we felt like it was the right place. Logistically, we will figure out how it is all going to come together. Moana has been very upbeat and positive and is really an inspiration to me. She has taken the news well but I know that she is a little scared. The love and support that we have received has been life changing. It completely changes the way that I look at the world.

Medical,31,Love & Prayers for Indigo Rose,https://www.gofundme.com/25f8xjck,"SANTA CLARITA, CA","May 13, 2018","$50,000","$41,674","Three weeks ago, our family got the kind of phone call that everyone dreads. My three-year-old niece was being rushed to the hospital by ambulance. She had suddenly lost control of the entire right side of her body and could not stand on her own. While my terrified sister and brother-in-law, Megan and Rob, rushed with Indigo Rose to the hospital, the rest of us paced by the phone, anxious for news. Indigo had always been healthy, so we were hopeful that nothing could be seriously wrong.When Megan called, however, the news was bad. Indigo had had a stroke, and the doctors didn't know why. For days, she had to undergo test after test, from bloodwork to EEGs to MRIs and MRAs. She had another stroke two days later, where she was paralyzed on one side of her body again. She had to have so many tests that the doctors had to insert a PICC line that goes from the veins in her arm to her heart to make blood draws and medicine easier to administer.After a few more days, the doctors had some answers for us. They diagnosed Indigo with Moyamoya, which is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder. She is at Stage 4, whereas other children diagnosed at her age are generally Stage 1 or 2. Moyamoya causes the  arteries at the base of her brain grow narrower and narrower over time, leading to strokes, muscular weakness, seizures, and, without medical intervention, death. The pediatric neurosurgeons at UCLA recommended bilateral revascularization surgery, which bypasses her blocked arteries,  as the only way to  save Indigo's life.Last week, Indigo underwent the surgery. While the plan was to work on both sides of her brain, the neurosurgeons realized mid-surgery that Indigo's brain was hemorrhaging, and so she was too weak to have the operation on both sides. They spent 6 hours working on the left side of her brain, and they will have to repeat the surgery on the right side of her brain in another 6 months. She woke up from the surgery in extreme pain, and her little face was swollen and bruised.Although the surgery was nerve-wracking for everyone, especially Megan and Rob, we thought that maybe the worst was over. It wasn't. During the night after the surgery, Indigo suffered another stroke. The following night, she started having seizures, one of which lasted more than three hours. That seizure caused Indigo to again lose all her mobility, and also took away her ability to speak.From the time this nightmare began until today, Indigo has had 5 strokes, and 16 seizures.She can't move or talk the way she used to,  and she is scared and bewildered by what is happening to her. She suffers from night terrors, hallucinations from her anti-seizure medications, vomiting, and overwhelming exhaustion. Her little body has been through so much. Megan and Rob cannot bear to leave her side. They are in agony watching their little one suffer as she is. Her life is hanging in the balance.Indigo has been hospitalized in the ICU for nearly a month now.  As a result of this medical catastrophe, their medical bills are piling up. Current estimates put Indigo's medical bills in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. They need as much help as they can get to help Indigo get well enough to go home, and then to return to the ICU for the second half of her surgery. This beautiful, strong, sweet little girl has been through so much, and she is fighting so hard to live and thrive. Please help as much as you can.",497,2.9k,9,496,3 months,24 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,32,Stroke Rehab for Jacquie Marumoto,https://www.gofundme.com/stroke-rehab-for-jacquie-marumoto,"WESTPORT, CT","May 16, 2018","$100,000","$42,433","Dear Friends & Family of Jacquie Marumoto,As most of you know, a little over a year ago in February of 2017 Jacquie suffered a massive, debilitating hemorrhagic stroke. Those early days and weeks were very medically challenging and it was unclear how or IF Jacquie would ultimately recover. After 6 arduous weeks of fighting for her life in the Yale Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Jacquie was transitioned to Gaylord Rehabilitation for 4 months of intensive therapies where she made significant progress towards gaining independence: improvement in swallowing, feeding, speech therapy etc.. Following this challenging therapeutic rehab experience she was discharged to a rehab center in Fairfield. Jacquie returned home eight months ago. While she has continued to progress, recovery is slower and it is unclear how complete the recovery will be. She is still in a wheelchair and fully dependent on her husband, Larry, sister in-law, Jill, family from California, and many other care providers. Life at home has it’s own set of challenges from the vantage point of a wheelchair: narrow interior doorways, lack of a wheelchair accessible ramp for entering & exiting the home, and limited access to the kitchen only to name a few.Before her stroke Jacquie had an 11 year career with Oracle most recently serving as Senior Director in the health sciences group. She took a very active role in raising their daughter, Avery now 10. Accompanying Avery to her activities, birthday events, and school commitments was something Jacquie always took pride in doing. She enjoyed Yoga classes and was an avid golfer. In short, she was like all of us: multidimensional and enjoying a full work, family, and recreational life.Recently Jacquie was admitted into an outpatient program in Norwalk. However, upon starting the out-patient program her home health aide support was cut off. Now, Larry and young Avery must be responsible for attending to all her daily living needs. This understandably has resulted in an inability for Larry to resume full employment, which in turn has amplified the healthcare cost burden on the family. A prideful man, Larry has resisted overtures for financial help for many months. He chose to draw down the family's savings rather than ask for help. Unfortunately, the costs have now become overwhelming. Jacquie’s projected healthcare costs for the next two years are projected to be over $100k - Insurance, deductibles, therapy equipment, home modifications needed for wheelchair accessibility ….. the list of financial demands is nearly endless !We are fortunate to live in an affluent community, and most of us are lucky enough to have successful careers. Until two years ago, Jacquie and Larry were as fortunate as we are. It is sobering and sad to realize how quickly this can be lost, and how precarious our seemingly stable lives can actually be.While Jacquie has made significant progress and now is, in very general terms, able to:-- speak -- though volume, word recall, and breath control are still issues-- walk using a walker with assistance-- sit upright and maintain balance with some prompting-- transfer from a wheelchair to bed and more with assistance-- accomplish most ADLs (activities of daily living) at a wheelchair level with minimal assistancePlease join us in our goal to ease their burden. We are starting this “Go Fund Me” page in an effort to raise  $100K to help support our friends in need. With our help, Jacquie can continue to progress with her rehab and her home can be made more comfortable and accessible. Our small contributions will go a long way, and Jacquie (and Larry) will be eternally grateful for your generosity of spirit.With love & gratitude, Team JacquieCindy Reejhsinghani, Jill Perlstein, & Sabrina Maurer",199,444,15,206,3 months,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Due to recommendations from her doctor at the center, she is going to be receiving a low dose chemo treatment twice a week. This is not a traditional form of chemo and it is administered with insulin. The side-affects are minimal and the results have been very promising with other recipients. However, it is very expensive, well over the cost of the initial treatment plan. Each treatment is $5000 and her treatment calls for 2 infusions per week. In addition to the new cost of treatment, we're looking at an extended stay in California.  We have exhausted every financial avenue available to us and  without your generosity our funds will run out before the end of this week. That is how urgent this request is. We appreciate everything that you have all already given and we humbly ask you to continue to give what you can. Please share with everyone that you can and ask them to share it as well. Hi, We’re Tim and Kaitlyn Yant.. Thanks for taking a few minutes to read our story. We first met when we were just kids in our church youth group but started dating when we ended up going to the same college years later. We got married in November of 2009. We finished school, got real adult jobs, and bought our first house. Everything a young couple usually does. Five years after getting married we decided to start trying to have babies. After years of trying doctors diagnosed Kaitlyn with uterine fibroids but said there didn’t seem to be any other complications other than the fibroids. But, there definitely was... On May 12, 2017 we went out to dinner with Kaitlyn’s family - a normal family dinner on a Friday night. After getting home that evening Kaitlyn began experiencing a lot of stomach pain. After being in pain all night we decided to head to the emergency room on Saturday May 13th. Expecting it to be a common gall bladder issue or something like that, we couldn’t have ever prepared ourselves for the news we were going to get... A CT scan revealed a very large malignant mass in Kaitlyn’s uterus. Kaitlyn was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, low grade serous carcinoma. A punch to the gut. Our world stopped spinning as every plan for our future came crashing down around us. We broke the life altering news to our families that Mother’s Day weekend 2017. Then began the whirlwind of doctors appointments and treatments. Kaitlyn endured surgery after surgery and unsuccessful treatments. We were told that she would have a maximum of 1 year to live. Kaitlyn’s oncologist said that the cancer she has does not usually respond to chemo so if we wanted to pursue having traditional chemo treatments there is a very high chance that it would not work or if it did work, then the chance of the cancer coming back a few years later and being more aggressive is extremely high. BUT, the fight is NOT over yet. Kaitlyn has beat the odds and is now living day by day past the one year original prognosis. Because of the grim outcome of traditional treatments we have chosen for Kaitlyn to seek non-traditional treatments at Cancer Center for Healing in Irvine, CA where they have seen success in stopping and reversing cancer! Cancer has stolen a lot from us - Our ability to have children, our money, and our time. But it can’t take the things that truly matter - our joy, our faith, and our hope. Please warrior on with us in prayer as we cry out for Kaitlyn’s complete healing. Also, please consider donating to help pay for the numerous medical bills, medical supplies, and further treatments that Kaitlyn needs.",301,1.9k,11,346,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,33,Miracle Matthew,https://www.gofundme.com/miracle-matthew,"ANKENY, IA","August 3, 2018","$40,000","$40,955","Matthew James CorpsteinJuly 29th, 2018Where to begin to tell this miracle story of Matthew’s? I feel like I could write an entire book. This has been a long difficult road filled with many sad tears, happy tears, big decisions, and everything in between. I’ll stick with a short version for now and write the entire story at another time. During our 20 week ultrasound, which led to several others and a MRI quickly following, the doctors discovered that our baby was missing most of his/her brain. And instead of a brain, it was replaced with cerebral spinal fluid. The fluid was going to continue to expand the head of our baby. The head size was measuring about 3 weeks ahead of normal. We were told our baby wouldn’t live past several days, if not hours, or die before birth. The diagnosis given was semilobar holoprosencephaly, and the prognosis for these cases are very bleak. Essentially since half way through our pregnancy, we have been preparing to bury our precious little one, and spend as much time as possible with him or her as we could. While still pregnant, we tried to do as many memory-making things along the way like: baby’s first motorcycle ride, baby’s first vacation, and other fun things to fill our hearts with happiness instead of focusing purely on the sadness that would inevitably come. Speeding this story up to week 37 with our last ultrasound on Friday, July 27 our perinatologist looked at the ultrasound and said that if we wanted any chance of a normal birth without c-section, we needed to get induced immediately. Baby’s head size has grown to 4-5 weeks ahead of schedule. We were admitted to Mercy without issue within a couple hours and began the birth and induction process. After 2 full days of induction with nothing like our birth plan (more of that story to come later), we gave birth to Matthew James Corpstein at 11:21am, 7 pounds 14 oz, 21 inches. He was breathing and regulated his heartbeat on his own. We were told that these were things he would do, but the doctors weren’t sure he would be able to feed. We were told he likely wouldn’t see, hear, or feel pain. After he was born, he was able to latch and nurse right away. He responded to lights, voices, and touch. These were things that he supposedly wouldn’t do. We decided to do a follow up MRI to determine if the original diagnosis was right. The results came back, and then suddenly we were talking with a pediatric neurosurgeon who said that he definitely DOES NOT have semilobar holoprosencephaly. That there is much more brain tissue than originally thought, and instead he has hydrocephalus. This new diagnosis still means Matthew has extra fluid in his brain, but the difference is that the fluid is pushing the brain tissue to the side of the head, making it appear as if there’s no tissue, when in fact there is. The new MRI showed that they could see all or almost all of the front and right brain tissues, and most of the back side. The left side was difficult to tell because that area had the most fluid that was pushing into all the other sides of his brain. The neurosurgeon told us it’s possible he could lead a completely normal life. Many hydrocephalus babies live with no abnormalities. Many also have some developmental delays or disabilities. We simply couldn’t believe what we were hearing! We had prepared for the last 4 to 5 months of not bringing a baby home, of using hospice and end of life care, and now suddenly Matthew’s chances of survival are high and having a fully functioning life could be possible! It’s like buying a lottery ticket and actually winning the jackpot! We were overjoyed, and I just still can’t put into words how we feel about the amazing news. We know God was protecting us and our beautiful baby boy, and we had put our faith in His hands, come whatever may. So where are we now with all of this?Matthew needed to do emergency brain surgery to drain the fluid from his brain, which would allow his brain tissues to expand back. The surgery happened when he was just two days old, on Tuesday, July 31. This required putting a shunt in his brain, that would drain down into his abdomen. He will have this for the rest of his life, and likely will have other surgeries, tests, and MRIs down the road to make sure it is functioning properly as he grows. Surgery went well, and he is recovering like a champ.

Scott has been going through some issues for a while, and after undergoing medical care we now know the severity of his medical/physical/emotional condition. A lot of you have reached out and wondered what is going on. Scott has been a wonderful friend to all of us, from taking people to their favorite  shows, taking photographs of them, and showing you the best places to have ramen in LA. Scott has been in the music industry for a long time, and sadly will be unable to continue working as a full time photographer. He’s a friend, Father, and Grandpa. We all want him to get as healthy as he can, and recover to his best abilities. Recently, Scott has admitted to very concerned friends that he had used a heavy recreational drug for an extended period of time this year. Through a meeting with his daughter Kassy and friends, they convinced him that his health was a major concern and the drug usage was possibly causing behavioral and physical problems. While hospitalized, they found that his heart was severely thickened, causing heart failure which he will have to be monitored closely and take medication for the rest of his life. Neurologically he has suffered multiple strokes that have affected his entire brain. There are certain parts that will no longer function properly, causing severe behavioral changes and some physical ones. The damage is permanent and irreversible. He will be going to physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and speech therapy to rewire the brain. He will also be going to a rehab center for drug usage when medically better. Currently this is what we know, and these are the conditions he has been diagnosed with: Leukoencephalopathy Intracranial atherosclerosisHypertrophic cardiomyopathyScott is in the care of his Daughter Kassy, his Mother, his sister Coleen, and his brothers. Kassy is handling all his finances, and will be handling all donations for payments for treatment.

He is an incredible band director, a friend to all, a mentor to countless students, a devoted family man and a loyal follower of Christ. In January of 2018, John was told due to a  heredity condition, he would need heart surgery. It didn’t seem fair to any of us because John is an incredibly healthy person. However, he chose to follow his doctor’s advice and have the surgery. Within three days of his surgery, and while still in recovery at the hospital, we were told that John had three massive strokes. He was airlifted to another hospital in Charlotte and after a procedure to stop the strokes, was put in the neurological ICU. When he first started to wake up, John was paralyzed on the entire right side of his body. He couldn’t speak, eat, stand, sit up, or even keep his eyes open for longer than a few seconds. Since then, almost 4 months has passed. John has made incredible progress that seemed impossible by many doctors. He has full physical function of his body. He is actually very physically fit considering what he has gone through. Cognitively though, he still has a long road ahead of him. We have discovered through an incredible amount of research, that there is a facility that can help John with his specific needs in Atlanta. His doctors do not think there is any other facility that can help him in the way that he desperately needs. Insurance will not help John pay for the rehabilitation in Atlanta. As a family, we have decided we have to help him get there regardless. We are now at a point that we have exhausted all financial means possible. We are so greatful for the hundreds of people who have already helped John with donations, food, cards, gifts, and keeping his house maintained. We are asking now that anyone out there who knows John personally or through the grapevine, to please donate what you can to his cause.  The rate for care at the facility in Atlanta is over $1000 per day. With an average length of stay of 90 - 120 days we would ultimately need to sell John's home to cover the expense. We are desperately trying to keep his life waiting for him exactly as he left it but we also know we have to get him back first. Any and all help you can give is greatly appreciated by all of us. If you can’t give financially, please add John in your thoughts and prayers. His army of prayer warriors has gotten him through countless hurdles already. Now he just needs to get through a few more.

Occasionally I am asked- ‘what do you like to do when you’re not traveling for work’?  My reply?  “Travel for fun”!But in May 2014, I was diagnosed w “Mumford and Sons”. Ok its MS, or “Multiple Sclerosis”, but I just try to make a very uncool disease sound a little bit cooler to take my mind off the tragic, senseless loss of functions, and mobility, notwithstanding the constant pain and fatigue. Many advances have been made in the medical field for MS that slow the progression of the disease, but there is no cure and there is no stopping the inevitable outcome of permanent disability. In the course of 4 years, I have been on two different treatments, the latest and strongest available- Tecfidera and then Ocrevus, which have been very costly. This has been a great hardship on us, to say the least. The real challenge has been however, that my condition has continued to deteriorate with walking and doing most physical activities extremely hard. Even more challenging is the stress brought from fatigue/exhaustion, extreme sensitivities to heat and the “cog-fog”, or simply the ability to think and to concentrate.MS is a cruel disease, taking most of the things I enjoy in my life away from me and my family. Yes, they have suffered along with me and made countless sacrifices for me along this journey.But there is one and only One treatment to permanently STOP MS, and it is HSCT. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.HSCT                                        Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, blood cell-producing stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body. The person remains in the hospital for an additional period of time while the immune system begins to rebuild itself. The immune system gradually rebuilds itself anywhere from 3 months to a year.NEXT STEPSI have been accepted to Pirigov Hospital in Moscow with Dr. Denis Fedoreno, a world-renowned Miracle Man in this field.I begin treatment on October 22, 2018, so some very short 5 months away! This is terribly exciting and at the same time terribly stressful.  Stressful in the sense of how much preparation is involved, providing care for Lynn as she accompanies me, taking care of my business activities for a period of time, and most of all, for the cost of the treatment. It is $50,000 USD for treatment, including the hospital stay in Russia, and then another estimated $10k for travel and logistics (including lodging for Lynn). Treatment will take approximately 30+ days, so we will be away for some time. And unfortunately, insurance does not cover any of the cost. My goal is to raise $40,000.Despite the difficulties, I have maintained a full-time work schedule, including travel of 100k to 150k miles of flying every year, convention schedules, customer meetings, board meetings, and various other work activities. I have done everything in my power to hold on to a career and job that I love and support my family while doing so. I like to say- “I don’t quit when I’m tired, I quit when I’m finished!” But this dedication has come with a price. A steep price, both physically and mentally.But with a glad heart, I have been Blessed with receiving a “Golden Ticket” (Willy Wonka reference, but you got that, right??) It is worth more than all the Gold in the world, but it also comes with the price of Gold! So far, I have never asked for any help along my journey, but honestly, I am at the point where I must humbly call upon friends and colleagues to consider “investing” in me to help me get my life back! This is a matter of My Life, or a Life left of diminished probabilities and possibilities.I miss taking walks, I miss being able to go out for dinners, to see friends, to make plans and NOT having to cancel, to travel to see the balance of our bucket list, and mostly to be able to practice my violin without excruciating pain in my hands and arms. The list of “I miss” is long, but the chance of doing these things again is Great. Great is His Faithfulness……I do not do this or ask this lightly, it has come from prayerful consideration and a great deal of humility. The fact is, there is a solution, I can see it, I can almost touch it, but I need your help.If would consider playing a part in ‘Reclaiming My Life- 2018”, I would deeply appreciate your help.

Medical,33,Help with Sophie’s hospital bills,https://www.gofundme.com/help-with-sophies-hospital-bills,"CAVE CREEK, AZ","March 29, 2018","$50,000","$40,737","Hello All, Many of you may know Sophie- my beautiful, intelligent and happy four year old niece. Recently she went for her routine four year check up and had very high blood pressure (about 160/100). The doctor told her mom (Ana) to come back and they would check it again. Her blood pressure was high again when they went back. After cat scans and MRI’s they saw a narrowing in her aorta in a few places, a smaller kidney and a enlarged heart. All of this made no sense to any of us, she was always so happy and full of life. Sophie didn’t seem sick at all. Ana and Scott flew Sophie to Cinnicinati children’s hospital to get a procedure done to help with the narrowing. There they discovered that her insides were inflamed so they could not continue with the procedure. At this point we heard the first possible diagnosis of takayasu- an extremely rare auto immune disorder. Sophie was emmited to Phoenix Children’s for 16 days while they tried to treat her inflammation and high blood pressure. She left the hospital recently on seven different types of blood pressure medications, steroids and chemo with the hope that we would continue her treatment at home and get another MRI in 3 months to see the progression. Unfortunatly, that was not the way it worked out. Sophie started crying in pain because her foot was hurting. Ana noticed that it was colder than the other foot and discolored. Worried she rushed her to the hospital. They did more testing on her and found out that she had a massive old and hardened blood clot near her hip and another blood clot in her toe. After two failed procedures to get the blood clot to move, Sophie’s lungs colapased yesterday and she is currently on breathing tubes. Ana and Scott plan to fly her to Boston children’s hospital in a medical emergency plane where they have doctors who have treated this horrible disease takayasu and can help her with her blood clotting. This is the most traumatic event my family has ever been through. Sophie is our little angel and was a happy four year old girl with so much life in her. This experience has drained her and her beautiful parents who are doing everything they can to save their little girls life. The last thing I would want is for them to worry about money and hospital bills. I know that currently they are in a lot of debt with everything that has happened. The debt is the last thing on their mind, but if we can help make their lives easier while they continue this hard and long battle then it would mean the world to them and to me. I appreciate you taking the time to read about Sophie’s story. If you are unable to help financially, just sharing this message and getting the word out there is more than enough. I will also be posting updates of how Sophie is doing periodically. Thank you for your support! We are #sophiestrong! ***Please note: at the moment Ana and Scott are not in a place to discuss Sophie’s state. They are focused on getting her the best care and being a strong support for Sophie in the hospital. Please respect their privacy right now as this is all very new. If you have questions, you can direct them to me. Warmly, Kelsey",399,1.4k,9,391,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Her life was turned upside down one year ago when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.Treatment So Far:  Kat had surgery in March 2017 to remove tumors from her colon and appendix. Since then she has undergone 18 rounds of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the chemo is not working and the tumors continue to spread and grow, threatening vital body functions.Life-Saving Surgery:The latest colonoscopy revealed that Kat has another extremely large tumor that is fast growing and aggressive. Kat will be flying from Santa Rosa, California to Washington DC for a life-saving cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) in March 2018. This surgery will remove the tumor, part of her bowel, spleen, uterus, part of the abdomen and all discovered areas where cancerous cells are found. Immediately after, she will get a high dose, high temperature chemotherapy bath applied directly into the abdomen to attack microscopic cancer cells. Kat will be in the ICU for two days minimum following surgery and in the hospital for at least 14 days. She will probably not be able to walk when released from the hospital.Hope & Your Help:Kat is extremely fortunate that the surgeon who invented this procedure, Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, will be performing the surgery. While Kaiser has agreed to pay for most of the medical expenses, your donations will help towards expenses in Washington DC and with the long recovery back home. Kat has not worked in her full-time job at Santa Rosa Junior College since she was admitted to the hospital one year ago. Thanks:Kat believes this surgery will save her life and give her many additional years with her family. She and her family would like to thank you in advance from the bottom of their hearts for your generosity!

She spent her entire adult life caring for other people’s kiddos, feeding the elderly, and volunteering to cook for kids in the community.  She and her husband, VG, have hosted Danish exchange students and have a rescue Beagle. They open their home to family and friends in need, always offer healthy food, and a sense of community. Monica cares deeply about supporting local businesses and eating the healthiest food available (her instagram is @allmymoneyisforfood). She spreads her love throughout the community with food deliveries, babysitting, and care-taking for local families (many of whom have also been touched by cancer).How Monica Learned She Had Adrenocortical Carcinoma - 1 in a Million chances.Monica finally met the love of her life in 2010. She and her husband were eager to have children but unfortunately this was not possible. This was devastating for such a loving couple who care so much about children. Then in 2015 and 2 miscarriages later, they were both hit by more stunning news. Monica had to have her right adrenal gland and tumor removed. The results came through a week later, it was Adrenocortical Carcinoma “ACC” a one in a million cancer with a very high recurrence rate.  Monica didn’t have to do treatment, as the only chemo used for adrenocortical carcinoma “ACC” is mitotane (a derivative of DDT) and the jury is still out (ongoing clinical trials) as to if it actually prevents recurrence. The only known cure for adrenal cancer is surgical removal. Alternative Diet to Prevent RecurrenceMonica had radically changed her diet to be “plant based” to hopefully prevent recurrence.  For such a rare and “orphan” cancer, where less than 600 cases are diagnosed a year, it’s largely up to the individual to decide which course of treatment is best, to be your own advocate and push for scans to find recurrence ASAP. However the Follow-up Scan found Lesions on the LiverMonica pushed for a scan in the spring of 2017, after coughing for a month or more and worrying that she had a lung recurrence. Fortunately, there was no recurrence in 2017. However, when the next scan came in May of 2018, they did detect liver lesions. The cancer recurrence was also wrapped around her IVC, making surgery more risky.  The head surgeon of Santa Barbara’s Ridley-Tree cancer center said that surgical resection was possible but after further imaging, decided it was impossible at the cottage hospital and too risky. Please Help Monica fight This Inoperable Metastasis Which Chemo Can’t KillBecause of this inoperable metastasis which chemo can’t kill, Monica wants to try holistic therapy in Arizona (as seen in “Cancer Can Be Killed"" documentary on Amazon). Because this approach is non-traditional medicine and is not covered under traditional insurance, the financial burden will be significant. Because this cancer is aggressive, she needs to begin this alternative approach now. Help extend Monica's life. She still has more to give and share with the community. We will continue to update you on Monica's journey in her fight against this cancer. Thanks for sharing this and for your consideration.",218,524,24,237,2 months,18 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

But it is especially difficult to comprehend when it attacks someone has spent their entire life supporting others. If you know Kevin then you know that he is a man of incredible character. He is generous of spirit, time, and resources. And he is one of the warmest and most hilarious people you will ever meet.Kevin has committed himself - and his life -  to a practice of radical empathy for others. He also has committed his life to community advocacy. He did this initially during the AIDS crisis with ACT UP from the 1980’s-1990’s. Throughout his life he has supported and mentored many friends and helped them get back on their feet. Kevin’s advocacy work continues to mature and has become more refined over the years; in 2016, days after the Pulse massacre, Kevin co-founded Gays Against Guns (GAG) a volunteer group fighting to save lives through better gun laws. His contribution to this inclusive, grassroots activist group has been integral to its success and has earned him the moniker of “Mother GAG”.  Mother has fought for us, and now we are fighting for her.  Kevin is facing immediate surgery which will be followed by extensive cancer treatments. Kevin has been self-employed as a prop and set stylist for over 20 years. As a result of working under independent contracts, he has zero access to any short or long-term disability through an employer. This means that Kevin will have no income for the entire duration of his treatment and recovery. At least six months, if not more.  And no income means no money to pay for his insurance, his rent, and all basic living expenses. As a self-employed person, he carries the full cost of his health insurance on his own. Even with this insurance, he will be faced with with the significant additional costs of expensive treatments very much needed  to defeat the cancer.  The Hertzog family and the GAG family are asking the community to come together to support Kevin through this difficult time.

This will hopefully relieve some of the financial burden on this sweet family.Several people have asked how they can help and this is only one way. Prayers, however, are the absolute #1 way to help. We know that we serve a Risen Savior that can heal and work miracles in our lives. We are confident that He will get them through this valley.

Medical,34,Kidney Transplant for a New Life!,https://www.gofundme.com/Kidney4Mathieu,"FORT LAUDERDALE, FL","May 13, 2018","$40,000","$40,513","In 2009, after moving from America to Sweden I fell ill.  At first, it was a sinus infection that would not go away, then shooting pain like lightning bolts going from my jaw through my brain. The E.R. doctors at the time proceeded with a sinus drainage, the experience was painful and pointless, since it was repeated 6 times to no avail.  The infection traveled to the lungs, and quickly went from bronchitis to pneumonia. I was back at the E.R. this time, a month had elapsed and I had dropped from 180lbs to 160lbs. I stayed 2 weeks in the infectious wing of the hospital in Sweden before deciding to fly out to Paris France to see if they could find out what I had.Four days, during 4 days I went through all possible tests and biopsies. Having traveled extensively prior to getting ill, all viruses and diseases were possible. Spinal tap, kidney and lung biopsies. I was so week by then that I couldn't get out of bed, my joints inflamed and locked weighing 146 lbs. In the afternoon of the fourth day the team of doctor and the professor of the Pulmonary department announced they were pretty sure they had pinpointed the culprit, however, my condition had deteriorated so much that there would not be a second try if they were wrong. The doctors were right. It was WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS. For the next 6 months I learnt to handle chemothreapy, then for the next 8 years I managed an illness that had chewed up my kidney to 50%.In January 2018, after completing my semi-annual round of chemotherapy, I got news that my kidneys were failing. This was so sudden it was surreal. I had not seen any signs or better said I couldn't see them because 2017 had been one long and arduous road. The new house I had bought, the family I had, my financial situation, all I had worked so hard to achieve all fell apart. My kidneys are now oscillating between CDK 5 and CDK 4. CDK 5 stands for Chronic Kidney Disease level 5 which is kidney failure, and the need for dialysis before Renal Transplant. CDK 4 means that damage to the kidneys is now irreversible and preparations for dialysis and a kidney transplant are necessary.A donor would, short of saving my life, give me a new life, one where I can taste, feel, live fully, without my body limiting and dictating what I can or cannot do or how active I can be. I work as a tennis pro and for the past 3 months I have been working at 50% of my capacity, eating away at my savings and at my weight, I have lost 12 lbs in the last 2 months. This past week I have been meeting with the transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic in Florida. I am now on a diet to help gain some weight back. I have started weight training again all to be in the best shape for the surgery.￼￼A kidney transplant involves a heavy financial cost, costly drugs and nearly 10 to 12 weeks before I can run and swing a racket after the operation. Every donation of any amount will help tremendously.My family is far away from me, the only family I have in Florida is my 2 year old daughter, who gives me strength and courage when the going gets tough. If you are not able to make a donation, please send your good thoughts and relay my story around you. It is difficult for me to write about this publicly and ask for help, I have tried for so long to keep this quiet and only those close to me really understand how serious things had gotten. ￼",145,376,2,145,3 months,13 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

Everyone that meets Ever loves her radiant smile, winning personality and non-convincing shyness. She's warm, funny, energetic and she's just beginning to explore her skills as a painter, and her role as a big sister.  On March 17th, 2018 Ever's life was changed forever, and our family's life was turned upside down as she was diagnosed with Leukemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-ALL). Needless to say we were utterly devistated upon hearing this diagnosis, but there was a bit of good news in the prognosis--ALL is curable. We now consider ourselves extremely fortunate, blessed, and luckly. We have something to hold onto. We have a hope. We have a (very) good chance to save our baby's life. That right, Ever can be cured and go on the live a close to normal life, but the ride will be long and extremely hard. Indeed, the road ahead is very difficult for Ever (and her family). She will face challenges that 3 year old children should never have face, including an infusion of chemotherapy for the next 26 months, high-frequency visits to the hospital, no exposure to large gatherings of people (public transportation, airplanes, movies, etc), a plethora of chemical cocktails and pills that would scare any sane person, a restricted diet, limited and/or no schooling, and most importantly limited access to friends, family and loved ones (to ensure she is not exposed to infectious diseases, viruses, and bacteria). Still, given the encouraging odds of her survival, we are holding our breaths, crossing our fingers and saying our prayers. That said, there is still a lot we just don't know? There are a lot of expenses that our family will incur that we will likely be unable to cover. We are investing a serious amount of time into understanding this disease, its associated costs, and the best tools for fighting it. Moreover, we are looking at ways to ensure Ever can remain a positive, creative and engaged as a toddler.  Honestly, we (Ever, Mom, Dad, and Shiloh) know its a lot, but we will get it done with the support of our friends, family and loved ones.  We want to thank you in advance for any generosity you can spare for this cause. We have outlined how funds will be used below and we will be upding this page and our facebook page over the next 2 years to keep everyone updated on Ever's progress.Again, we sincerely thank you for your time and generosity. 

What we know1. March 17th diagnosed with cancer (Leukemia)2. There is a cure, but it is a lengthy and expensive process 3. Chemotherapy is at the center of this cure4.

Medical,34,Help Heal Matt Hallock and Family,https://www.gofundme.com/heal-matt-hallock-and-family,"WATSONVILLE, CA","June 16, 2018","$90,000","$40,301","Hello dear friends, family, and future friends. Thank you to all of you who have encouraged us, pushed us higher, and called out the good that God has put in us...even during times when sickness made it hard to see that any good was there.It has been a few years now since we were publicly sharing details of my health with our friends, family and network. And here's why: We don't want sickness and doctors and treatments to define our lives. God has put a lot more inside us than just that. And to be honest, most of the time we'd rather talk about other dreams and projects, things we know God put us here to do. Thinks like:   --Corrie's book    --Rebecca's dance   --Our Steadfast Marriage ministry     --My newly started Masculine Christian writing endeavors   --My new High School English teaching adventureThese are the things that drive us. They are what God has put us here to do. But friends, it's time for me to talk about my health again. This disease is serious right now, and truthfully, we could use your support.For those of you who don't know our story, it's pretty long. So in case you don't have the time to read the whole thing, here are the bullet points for you.----------------------BULLET POINTS----------------------   1) I have battled a severe, aggressive case of autoimmune arthritis all over my body for 11 years. Was bed-ridden at one point...unable to function let alone work.   2) After 9 years of searching for curative treatments, we've spent the last two years at Stanford receiving heavy duty, dangerous drugs that had been doing a great job at alleviating the symptoms...but not CURING my body.   3) Those treatments...the MOST POWERFUL ones known to our conventional medicine system are not working anymore. And my pain, inflammation, immobility, weight-loss are rushing back aggressively.   4) Leading up to May, I was teaching full time as a High School English teacher (loving it and loving being ABLE to work). This helped us be able to rent our OWN HOME for the first time in 8 years. My girls have their own yard for the first time ever.   5) But my body is getting worse quickly and Stanford is about out of ideas. I can barely get up in the morning. Can't put on socks. Can't brush my teeth. Lots of pain. If school were back in session, I wouldn't be able to work. School starts in August, and I don't know if I will be able to return to teaching at that time.   6) I am also currently stuck on a drug called Prednisone, which is a steroid with serious side effects. It is eating away my bones, skin, and other connective tissues, but it keeps my pain down.   7) This is urgent. My body is getting worse quickly and we want to do SOMEthing to help me be able to work in August.   8) HOW YOU CAN HELP           --Donate to our fund any amount you feel able to           --Sharing this GoFundMe campaign with anyone you can think of who might have the heart and resources to                invest in our family.----------------------THE FULL STORY----------------------STANFORD TREATMENTSAlmost two years ago exactly, Corrie and I decided on a huge shift. For the 9 years prior, we had gone down every route we could find looking for a way to actually cure my body. We changed our nutrition (which we are thankful for and still embrace whole-heartedly). We traveled to a doctor in Nevada...twice.We attacked Lyme Disease, mycoplasma infection, used anything we could find to make headway.But my body still got worse. And it got to the point where I was taking 40mg per day of Prednisone in order to manage my pain and inflammation.At that point, two years ago, my current doctor said I needed to go see a standard rheumatologist and get the standard rheumatology drugs. That may be the only thing that would bring relief.So I went to Stanford, met an amazing doctor, and together we decided on my starting Remicade infusions. This is the. most. powerful. treatment option in the tool belt of standard conventional rheumatology.And for eight months, it worked beautifully. I was able to decrease my Prednisone down to 2mg per day. But then suddenly my body started resisting the Remicade, and my pain and inflammation came back.So we tried many of the other drugs in their tool belt...none of which did anything. And after 2ish months, we went back to Remicade which again helped for another 8 months or so...until this last May.BUILDING A NEW LIFE FOR OUR FAMILYBut before May hit, while that treatment was working, Corrie and I and our two girls (and dog) finally started to feel like we were getting to live a normal life.Last January, I applied for and immediately received a teaching position at my old High School teaching freshmen English. This was the first real job I had been able to work in about 6 years. And I was nervous about whether I'd be able to physically handle the schedule, but we went for it.I loved it. As near as I can tell, my students loved me too. They asked if I could teach sophomore English next year. They'd say I was their favorite teacher.I shared Jesus with them daily. I prayed for them. I saw Jesus heal them. And I've been planning with the administration a chapel venue that I could lead next year aimed at discipling the young men to be strong, confident, God-on-fire men ready to bring value to their world.Also, right after my starting teaching, we were able to move out of living with family and finally rent our first own home in 8 years. This is where we are now, and we love it. It's been a dream of ours that has felt so out of reach during the times when I could hardly get out of bed.Here's the girls playing in their first ever backyard :)The feeling of finally giving my family a home is amazing. I've been working hard both teaching and running my already existing side-business coaching students on the SAT in order to get our feet under us after these many years of dealing financially with this disease.THE CURRENT STATE OF MATT'S HEALTHBut then, this past May, the treatments I'm getting at Stanford, the most powerful option they know of, started not working again. And this time, my pain and inflammation started raging back faster and harder than before.It's difficult to share with you the severity of the condition, because it doesn't carry the same tragic connotation that other diseases do. You hear arthritis and you think, ""Well, that sucks, but at least it's not cancer or something.""I currently am waking up every morning in intense pain all through my body. So much so that I can't put on socks or brush my teeth. That pain and stiffness start to subside a little bit around 3pm and then ramp back up around 8pm. My feet joints are crooked and my toes are bending over on themselves. My knees don't straighten all the way.Years ago, my right elbow had such severe arthritis that it locked in about a 90 degree angle, and is still locked today.  Also I dropped down to about 115 pounds and looked awful. Corrie thought I was going to die.That's me, weighing something-a-grown-six-foot-man-shouldn't-weigh :)Now, my left elbow and wrist are starting to go the same direction.The pain and immobility are bad enough to lead me to cancel my speaking commitment at our church tomorrow, Father's Day 2018.At the moment, if school were in session, I wouldn't be able to work. School starts early August, there's a real possibility that I won't be able to go back.All of this from something that has been called Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropothy, Lyme Disease, or (most recentlly by Stanford) Psoriatic Arthritis.MATT'S CURRENT TREATMENT SITUATIONSo, after spending 9 years pursuing alternative treatments that were somewhat financially manageable, we finally went to one of the top facilities in western medicine and now their best option for me is not working. We are trying some other less powerful options but still seeing no effect.Since that's the case, my only option at the moment is to increase my Prednisone dose to very high levels, so that I can function. The problem with that is that Prednisone causes thin, tearable skin, brittle bones, and a host of other major side effects. I have broken my back and ribs and arm because of this.Also, it gives me quite a puffy face when the dose is high!But I choose either that or the daily pain and inflammation.HOW YOU CAN HELP FINANCIALLYI tell you all of this so that you can know two things:a) We want to take ownership of our lives and take care of ourselves so that we can give to others. I work hard and want to work harder and plan to.b) Even though I work hard and want to take care of my own crap, right now this disease is a big giant to slay. And I need help.We have set our goal at $90,000...here's the breakdown:Rent and Expenses through 2018 = $35,000We JUST got blessed with moving into our own home after all this time. I'm looking at maybe not being able to work and receive my salary when August hits. I want with all my heart to keep my family in our home and to give me more time to get my body well so I can get back to work and pay our own way.This portion would allow for that very thing.I will also be investing time, energy, and resources in my existing SAT business so that, if December hits and my body still needs more time, our business will be able to sustain us better than it does right now.Treatment at the Paracelsus Clinic in Switzerland = $55,000My body needs intensive, effective treatment. The best our system has to offer isn't working. Before, we tried visiting different doctor's offices in our area but nothing so advanced, all-encompassing, and powerful as this clinic in Europe.This is an estimate of the cost of the three week, daily treatment program that I would do there, including lodging and travel. I know that looks insanely expensive, but to put it in perspective...One of my Remicade infusions costs $50,000. And I get those every six weeks. And they're not even working anymore! (Thank goodness for Medicare)It's time I get freaking serious about healing because I'm done living on borrowed time that these super powerful drugs have given me. Clearly, under the surface of alleviated symptoms, my body is still massively struggling to be healthy.I don't have time to toy around with anything less than the most powerful options out there.My family needs their husband/dad/man to be strong and able to provide. Able to lead. That's why I'm not wasting time with little office visits here and there. This is serious.URGENCYWhile there is no hard deadline on this...we have to move quickly for a couple reasons.1) I want to teach again come August. I love it and the kids need me.2) My body, when it starts to flare up, gets worse very quickly.  One week I can be playing outside with the girls, and the next I can be barely able to step out the door.3) Planning for our finances, if I don't return to work in August, we will need to pay rent and other expenses while I get my body back online.For all those factors, I want to move fast and begin action on this even within the next month.FINAL THOUGHTSWe know with all our hearts that God is our provider. We have seen him do miracles in our finances without us ever asking anyone. But right now, we are asking you, the people that he has used to bless our lives so much already, if you can help us during this fourth-quarter-half-court-shot time.If you are able to donate, you would bless our whole family. Even if you can't donate, could you please share this with your network? Social media, personal emails, calls, whatever you think of. I'm calling all hands on deck for this one, so however you are able to spread the word, we would be very thankful.Bless you all. I pray that Jesus fills you all with his goodness and hope and that he answers any places of pain in your own life and brings you victory...even that victory that you've been waiting a long time for.You were meant to conquer. Never settle for anything less. We love you.",240,636,18,250,2 months,2 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

A freshman at Central Michigan University, he began having pain in his hip that continued off and on throughout his first semester. The pain intensified around Christmas of 2017 at which point he was referred to an orthopedic doctor who suspected it was an injury from his last baseball season. ￼￼￼An MRI done in January of 2018 showed a mass on his hip at which point he was referred to an Orthopedic Oncologist that diagnosed him with Fibrous Dysplasia. With the Dysplasia diagnosis, it was recommended that he begin physical therapy. Noah went to therapy three days a week for six weeks with no resolve to his pain, in fact it had exacerbated. Undergoing another MRI, doctors discovered that the mass on his hip had enlarged to the point that it fractured his femur. Surgery was then scheduled for June 20th to clean out his joint as well as biopsy the inflamed area. ￼￼￼On June 28th his biopsy results confirmed that the mass on his pelvis was actually a Tumor, more specifically a bone Tumor named Ewing’s Sarcoma.Ewing’s Sarcoma for those who do not know, is a very rare type of cancerous tumor that grows in ones bones or the soft tissue around ones bones. Ewing’s sarcoma affects about 200 children and young adults every year in the United States. Within a week of this diagnosis, Noah underwent a PET scan, 2-D scan, multiple x-rays, an MRI, blood work and a bone marrow test. By the grace of God, his sarcoma did not metastasize and is currently contained within his pelvis. It has grown to the size of a tennis ball, pushing on his bladder. ￼￼￼Those of you who know Noah are well aware of the incredible young man he is. We have not once heard Noah complain about this diagnosis. He is an inspiration to all of us with his continued positive outlook on life. He has always been an exemplary student, graduating high school with a 4.0 GPA while maintaining his commitments to baseball and family. He has just begun his next journey pursuing a career in business at Central Michigan (again still maintaining his 4.0 GPA his freshman year). The evening of his biopsy surgery he made sure to complete an assignment that was due for an online summer course he was taking! The kid does not stop! This is why we know he will beat this with a vengeance!￼￼￼￼￼￼Noah’s treatment will require chemotherapy and radiation, along with extended hospital stays due to the intensity of his treatments over the course of the next year. He will require multiple scans, x-rays and MRI’s during and following treatment.It goes without saying that all of your continued prayers, love and support mean so much to the Holloway’s! If you are also able to offer any financial support your contribution will help to pay for Noah’s treatment for this disease which includes insurance deductibles, co-pays and any out of pocket expenses for treatments, medication and supplements not covered by insurance. Even the smallest donations will help. ￼￼￼As Noah begins his treatments, please continue to keep him in your thoughts and prayers. We know that with the support of those around him; his strength, determination and faith will guide him through this next year and kick this disease! Thank you, we are beyond grateful for all of your support!￼￼￼*This GoFundMe is organized and run by Noah Holloway's family members; Jonathan Ren, Kristyn Ren, Rich Ren & Traci Ren in the Metro-Detroit area. All contributions made to his cause go directly to the care and future of Noah Holloway including insurance deductibles, co-pays, out of pocket expenses for treatments, medication and supplements not covered by insurance.

He will always share whatever he has without question whether it be food or toys or anything.  When he gets in trouble or does something he shouldn’t, he is always the first to want to say sorry and mean it. There is not a mean bone in this little boy’s body.  Mommy and  Mayz have  a special relationship too. He will pick flowers out of the front yard or anywhere to give to Mom almost every day. He tells Mom that she is beautiful and that he loves her all the time. He’s even says, ""You are the best mommy in the whole world.""   He always wants to help Mom bring in the groceries, make dinner or cleanup. He is the first person to give you a hug when you are feeling sad. He plays baseball and loves his video games. He is a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Star Wars. Mayz also loves the Angels and his favorite player is Mike Trout. He even picked #27 for his jersey number this year.  Early in March 2018, Mayz had a simple headache and went to the Doctor. That simple headache turned out to be every parent's worst nightmare, a malignant brain tumor. On March 12th, he had surgery to remove his tumor, which Doctors were able to completely remove. Unfortunately during that surgery, it was found that he has small spots on the backside of his brain and spine. Mayz had another surgery a few days after to put in a small tube to let fluid be released more naturally. This is an alternative to getting a permanent shunt. We are hopeful that this procedure works so that we don’t have to have another one. Pathology came back with results on the tumor. It is Medulloblastoma “metastatic” meaning it’s trying to spread.  This explains the spots the doctor saw in his brain and on his spine. He is at high-risk and will most likely need radiation and chemo therapy, maybe even at the same time. We keep praying and staying positive for our little “ Warrior”. (Thanks to the Lozano family for this title!) Mayz misses his friends, family, and teammates and hopes to soon be able to run, jump and play with everyone. He is a fighter with a never give up attitude and we all believe in his ability to make a full recovery. In the meantime, the whole process has been extremely hard on not only him but his family. His Mom Heather, Dad AJ, and Brothers Johnny and Skyler have all been doing their best to be there for him and cope with the situation.  THE ONE THING THE GONZALEZ FAMILY NEEDS IS THE GIFT OF TIME WITH MAYZ. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR DONATED WILL GIVE HIS FAMILY THAT TIME. This page is set up to help Mayz and his family in this difficult time. Any and all types of donations are considered a blessing. We thank you all so much for your love and support. Please support Mayz by keeping him in your thoughts and prayers! Your support will also lift his spirits and give him strength to continue the fight! #PlayForMayz #PrayforMayz#TeamMayz",412,2.1k,32,410,5 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,35,"Please help our baby boy, Israel.",https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-our-baby-boy-israel,"NORMAL, IL","March 21, 2018","$150,000","$39,655","My wife Monica and I were ecstatic when we found out we were pregnant while overseas in Jerusalem, but on February 2nd our situation took a turn for the worse. Specialty doctors at the Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio have informed us that our unborn son, Israel, has an obstructed bladder. This complication has in turn caused a myriad of other problems including Chronic post-renal kidney failure (the kidneys aren’t functioning), a massive urinoma (fluid filled cyst in the stomach), almost complete lack of amniotic fluid (which is crucial for lung development), and slightly underdeveloped lungs (due to the lack of amniotic fluid). To combat this, we are now driving four and half hours to Cincinnati and staying in hotels weekly in order for my wife to receive amnioinfusins (infusing artificial amniotic fluid), as well as getting extractions from the urinoma in order to drain the cyst of fluid. We have been informed that we will need to continue doing this weekly for several weeks, at which point we will have to increase the visits to twice a week. Ultimately we will have to relocate to Cincinnati for the remainder of the pregnancy for inpatient care. Because of the kidney failure, our baby will almost undoubtedly need surgery when he is born so that he can undergo Peritoneal Dialysis for the first few years of his life, until eligible for a kidney transplant. Because of this dialysis we will have to spend approximately six more months in Cincinnati until we are finally able to bring our baby home.We have been fortunate enough to have very good health insurance, but insurance doesn’t cover everything, and unfortunately, things like the weekly amnioinfusions are being charged to us personally at $950 a piece, a week. My wife will also likely need to go on short term disability at some point. As a small business owner, my business and income has taken a hit due to constant weekly travel to Cincinnati. Doctors have notified us that Dialysis can cost between $50,000 - $80,000 a year. On top of the large expense for Dialysis, copayments for medical expenses, gas, food, and hotels in Cincinnati are beginning to pile up. Additionally, financial responsibilities back at home that are still prevalent including monthly car payments, mortgage, my shop payments, and expenses related to our other three children. With less time being able to work due to increased trips to Cincinnati, we have decided to reach out to this community for financial help. We have already had to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket and the financial burden is only increasing in both frequency and amount as time goes on – Feeling overwhelmed by this, we know we need a miracle. My wife and I humbly ask that if you find it in your heart to help financially, that you donate whatever you can towards helping us, and most importantly, little Israel with his hard journey ahead.We understand that this journey will take many years, but it is a journey that we are proud to walk and just want to give our little baby all the love, help, and hope he needs in the world, so again we humbly ask you to walk this journey with us. We will be strict in using any money donated for the procedures and help for Israel and the special care required after he is born. We are committed to providing photos and videos, as updates to keep everyone informed as we go along this journey. We also ask that you keep all of us, especially Israel in your constant thoughts and prayers. We ask that you please share this and our story with everyone you know if you feel compelled to do so. We will be forever truly and genuinely grateful for any and all help provided to us and already feel convicted to help others with similar problems in the future. To read more in detail about our entire story thus far, please read below. Thank you all so much for taking the time in reading this and God bless.Our Story Thus Far:On February 2nd, 2018, my wife, mother, father, and I anxiously went to the hospital to have our scheduled sonogram, which was to definitively determine the sex of our baby. A few minutes into the sonogram, with smiles lighting up our faces, the nurse asked to excuse herself so that she could retrieve the doctor. I vividly remember a tangible chill creeping down my spine as the nurse left the room as our bright smiles turned to confused and concerned blank stares. The doctor came into the room, looked at the sonogram, and asked me and my wife if we would like to hear some updated news she was about to tell us in front of my parents, or if we preferred it privately. Privacy didn’t matter to us at this moment, we both quickly exclaimed “Just tell us what’s going on with our baby”. The doctor’s face was not that of joy, but more of concern. She proceeded to tell us that there was a massive, unknown cyst where the left kidney should be, there was almost no amniotic fluid around our baby, and she was very concerned that our baby might not make it... just like that, in a single, unforgettable moment, the words that poured from the doctors mouth immediately flooded the entirety of the room. The blow from this knowledge was the most surreal, immediate, gut wrenching hit I have personally ever experienced in my life, blindsiding us in a life changing way on a day that started out with so much happiness and hope. After hearing these crippling words, my wife broke down and started crying. I remember thinking to myself “You have to take care of this women, she is your priority, you can worry about yourself later” I gently grabbed her hair, softly kissed her on the forehead and said, “I love you Monica, everything is going to be ok...”Nobody prepares you in life for how incredibly hard it is to make someone you love believe something that you yourself, at the bottom of your own heart don’t fully know or believe. I pride myself with being an integrity driven, honest man, but in that moment I just wanted to make her emotional pain stop - I said whatever I had to in order to make that happen. The doctor informed us that we would need to be transferred to Peoria’s Children’s Hospital for further testing. We left our hometown hospital after our appointment was finished and headed straight for Peoria. The drive there was completely silent, until we almost reached Peoria. I turned on a song called Here as in Heaven performed by Elevation Worship. At the end of this particular song, the lyrics “A miracle can happen now, for the spirit of the Lord is here” rang out in my car. For the first time, tears poured from my eyes, not in a sobbing way, but more of an uncontrollable leaking of emotion and fear from my eyes, completely silent, hand in hand with my wife, finally realizing and coming to terms with the severity of our baby’s situation, understanding that more than likely we would need a miracle.Once we got to Peoria, they ran a few more tests and told us that the situation for our baby did not look good at all. They informed us that one of their big concerns was this unknown giant mass of fluid where the left kidney should be and that since there was almost no amniotic fluid around the baby, the chances that the baby could compress his umbilical cord and completely choke it off was a real possibility. This was all the news they had for us during our initial visit. We were told that they would know more in ten days at our next appointment and sent us on our way back home. Those were the longest ten days of our lives, every morning dreading the answer when I asked Monica if she had felt the baby kick each morning, fearing for the worst. Ten days slowly crept by and we finally went back to Peoria. Doctors informed us that after yet another sonogram, the mass of fluid had grown, and there was nothing that they specifically could do. They told us that if we would like, they could contact specialists at the Children’s hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio to see what they could do. We promptly agreed. On the way home from Peoria, feeling defeated, we received a call from Cincinnati saying that they could get us in to see the specialists in a weeks’ time. So we packed our bags, reserved hotel rooms, and impatiently waited for more time to pass.The time had finally come for us to drive 4 and half hours to Cincinnati, and we couldn’t get there fast enough. We arrived Monday, February 19th in the evening, anxiously awaiting our appointment Tuesday morning at 7:30am. On Tuesday, my mother had flown in from Arizona where her and my father were visiting my brother and his wife. The three of us met a social worker and Urologist first thing on Tuesday. We were informed that Israel’s right kidney (the one they could actually see) had some micro cysts that were apparent, and one prominent cyst on it, possibly showing evidence of damage to the right kidney. We left the hospital that day feeling worse than we had before when we still had hope that the right kidney was working.That Wednesday, Monica had an MRI, an echocardiogram for the baby, and we had a team meeting with six other specialist and a handful of nurses. Walking into the conference room where the team meeting was being held was a little overwhelming and also eye opening to see just how dire the situation for our baby was. Seeing all those white coats in one room just waiting to talk to us personally was unnerving to say the least. The amazingly detailed staff explained to us that the MRI had shown that this mass was a urinoma, but that they didn’t fully know what the fluid was exactly yet. They informed us that the baby needs amniotic fluid around it (which our baby had close to none) for healthy lung development prior to birth. Without this development, life simply is not possible. They also informed us that there was a bladder obstruction which is what actually caused the urinoma. Doctors explained that the kidneys at the time they were functioning, got backed up because of the pressure of not being able to be released through the bladder. The blockage and backup is ultimately what caused damage to Israel’s kidneys. The staff informed us that we had the option to do nothing, which they are obligated to say. The doctors explained that doing nothing would mean almost certain death for Israel. A second option was given, to proceed with steps to counter these problems and come up with a plan. They informed us that if we decided to move forward with this, that this would more than likely be a very hard, long road to travel. I promptly made it clear to them all that this is a child, not just any child - it’s our child. This is a human being and we are going to fight as hard as we possibly can for this little one, no matter what strains or hardships are in store for our future. The doctors looked to each other as if to all be in understanding around the room that our decision was clear. After a brief pause, one of the doctors spoke up and said that if we were planning on moving forward, the first step would be to do a procedure that involves sticking a needle into Monica’s lower abdomen to extract the fluid from the urinoma. He further explained that the procedure would involve either pulling the needle out just far enough to infuse artificial amniotic fluid, or potentially utilizing an additional needle for the amino fusion. I asked him when he could perform this thinking to myself we would have to wait another week or so, but he promptly said “I can do this for you tomorrow”. My wife and mother immediately teared up and we all sincerely and genuinely thanked the specialists numerous times before leaving the room, my wife and mother hugging most of them as we left.Early Thursday morning, around 2:30am, I woke up, not able to sleep and opened up the Bible app on my phone. The first verse that came up was Genesis 32:22, where Jacob wrestled with God, and God renames him Israel. Since we found out we were pregnant while in Jerusalem, we had already considered naming our baby Israel, but after reading this passage on that nervous, early Thursday morning, I felt like I was wrestling with God through the current situation and like this baby was wrestling for his life. After discussing my thoughts further with Monica that morning we decided our baby’s name will be Israel. That morning my wife and I met my mother at the hospital and went in for the procedure. I remember being nervous, especially for my wife, but we knew we were in very good, very capable hands. The doctor explained to us that with this procedure, there is a low risk of premature birth or miscarriage, but a risk just the same, so Monica signed the waiver and he started. Seeing a doctor insert an 8 inch needle into your wife is unpleasant, and I can only imagine the physical feeling that it gave her was even more so, but I held her hand as he started the procedure, all the while, keeping my eyes glued to the sonogram monitor. The doctor ended up draining 120mls from the urinoma, which is about a half cup of fluid from this little baby’s stomach. I remember seeing how much fluid he extracted and just wondering to myself “how?” I then saw from the sonogram monitor the doctor pull the needle out just enough to position the tube where it needed to go in order to infuse the artificial amniotic fluid, and started to infuse. I honestly can’t tell you the feeling that swept over me as I saw this amazing doctor breath hope and life back into our child, even now writing this, it brings tears to my eyes. We could physically see this fluid rush in on the monitor, and our little creation of God immediately respond by moving his arms and legs, feeling the fluid that started to surround him, playing in it... It is a sight that I will never forget as long as I live.After the procedure, the doctor informed us that they would send off the fluid for testing and would have the results back in a couple weeks. He told us that we would have to return to Cincinnati weekly for these extractions and infusions, for the next month or two and that towards the end of the pregnancy, we would have to return twice a week ultimately having to relocate to Cincinnati for the rest of her pregnancy and possibly some time afterwards. We went back to the hotel so that Monica could rest before we had to travel the four and a half hours back home the next morning. I immediately started to think about the severity of how our lives were going to change and what we could do in order to adapt the very best way possible.Since then, we have gone back to Cincinnati every week. On the third visit they received the results of the fluid from the urinoma and told us that they are abnormal, meaning that the kidneys aren’t functioning properly and Israel will more than likely need to be put on peritoneal dialysis after he is born. This also means that we will have to stay in Cincinnati for an average of six months and that baby Israel will have to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for a few years until he is eligible for a kidney transplant. Monica and I will also have to take training classes in order to understand how to do everything properly once we are able to bring him back home with us. The doctors don’t know how the lungs will develop and as of right now, they are right below the low end of normal, so there is still hope on that front.Needless to say, this is a very stressful and overwhelming time for everyone involved, but there is no other option. I can’t not love my unborn son and refuse to do anything less than fight as hard as I can for him. Throughout this entire endeavor thus far, the one constant is Israel’s strong, beating heart, it is unwavering as is ours to do everything we can to love this child. We humbly ask that you keep us in your hearts and in your prayers, and that you share our story with everyone that you know. We will continue to have faith that ultimately, this little baby’s life is in God’s hands. We have been fortunate enough to have amazing support from friends and family and will without a doubt keep everyone that donates, prays, and who has helped in any way completely informed and updated. Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our story, God bless you all.",297,2.4k,12,334,5 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Jeff was then med-flighted to Roanoke Memorial Hospital.￼￼Upon his admission, it was discovered Jeff had no feeling below his chest line. He had suffered what doctors called a catastrophic injury to his spinal cord as well as other acute injuries.Jeff’s medical team was able to stabilize his condition, but after further evaluation doctor’s suggested a surgery to stabilize and decompress Jeff’s spine. Roughly 24 hours after his initial arrival Jeff’s surgical team performed a procedure to insert a series of rods and screws into his spine. What doctors found during Jeff’s surgery was a complete spinal cord injury at his T2 vertebrae. His spinal cord was extremely inflamed and his dura shredded.While Jeff’s surgery was successful, he still remains in the ICU on blood pressure stabilization meidications and doctors were clear that it was unlikely that Jeff would ever walk again. As Jeff shifts modes to recovery we must pray that he is the one in a million that can beat the odds.

He was experiencing the blood in his coughing. It went on couple of days and then he made an appointment with doctor for check up. Test test test and test went on to figure it out that he has Lung Cancer of  Stage 4. Before starting up his treatments Anup had rigorous search on every doctors ,treatments and FAMILY expansion.

Born with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a rare and ""incurable"" liver disease, this special person felt compelled to enter an important service career and found out during a physical for that career that he had PSC. He was unable to pass the physical and began using intense holistic medicine. That cleaned him up short term and allowed him to become established in his career, but soon manifested into debilitating Ulcerative Colitis. He then lost extreme weight, was bleeding consistently, ended up in the hospital multiple times and almost lost his life. He tried several modern medicine regiments for years, including a chemotherapy but the drugs did not help and in some cases deteriorated his body and liver even more. With discipline and diligence he was able to alter his diet and follow an intense holistic regimen and just limp along in his job and life. The “cure” for PSC is a liver transplant, but the medical community will not even consider putting him on the transplant list due to the Ulcerative Colitis, so there is no cure in current medical protocols. This is a young man with a wife and small child! Not willing to accept a death sentence he did infinite research and found a clinic out of the country that has a very high success rate with actually healing and correcting his diseases with stem cell infusion therapy. Your donation to this fund saves a life, and for those that know him, an incredibly important life dedicated to helping us all.My son is the beneficiary for this campaign  He will be withdrawing the funds to pay for his upcoming medical treatments.  His first treatment is scheduled in early August at which time he must have $27K to cover the first round of expenses.

Medical,36,Pray for Rye Guy,https://www.gofundme.com/prayforryeguy,"OKLAHOMA CITY, OK","April 29, 2018","$100,000","$39,036","On Saturday, April 21st, at 10:11 am Rick found Rye unresponsive.  Jazzy heroically dialed 911 while Rick and a neighbor (who is an ER doctor) began CPR.  Julie was at a Foreign Language Teachers Conference in Jenks.  Once both parents had arrived, the ER doctor kindly, but clearly explained that since there had been no oxygen to Rye's brain for approximately 30-40 minutes we would be having conversations about organ donation withing 24 hours and that he would not survive.  That has been the consistent message from medical teams from the beginning.  The brain was expected to reach peak swelling by around 72 hours.  If herniation did not occur before that, an MRI would be performed.  The MRI Wednesday afternoon confirmed that there was extreme damage and cell death at all levels of the brain and on both sides.  The very minimal activity was from a very abnormal brain sending very abnormal signs.  With that news, coupled with the absolute lack of any physical responsiveness to hourly neurological tests (light shining in eyes, pinching of fingers, swabbing of eyeballs, tickling of feet, etc.), the family was made aware that it would be acceptable at any point to proceed with donor matching.  The desire of our family the entire time is for God to either completely heal and save Rye's life or save the lives of others through organ donation.  We love that physical picture of how Christ lost his life to give others eternal life.  Doctors and amazing nurses have worked tirelessly to ensure via the respirator, all kinds of medicines and monitors that Rye's organs stay healthy.  Since Julie needed a bit of time to process things, she asked if Saturday, a week after the accident, would be a reasonable day to let go of this precious child who may very well have been in Heaven (not the hospital) the entire week and move forward with donation.  Doctors said that would be fine while offering another day to Rick, ""we can do this earlier if you like.""  While dreading that possible moment on Saturday, we prayed for God to give us any clear sign that Rye might possibly be in that body or that He make him completely brain dead so we could have no doubt in our minds that it is God, not us, taking our child's life.  Being a donor family comes with the complication that finality of earthly life is less visibly clear.  Even after declaration of death, machines will keep this child's body ""alive.""  We, as parents, will potentially not see our child breathe his last and have the closure of such a scene.  We may have already seen that.  Julie has repeatedly said that ""I am not sure if Rye is in this hospital, but I am very sure that Jesus is. God is clearly in every person who visits, hugs, prays, brings coffee, sings over Rye, etc.""         Friday, April 27, God blessed us with postponing our Saturday plans.  Rye showed an appropriate response to pain.  He moved his shoulder when his shoulder was pinched hard intentionally by the physician (instead of inappropriately moving his leg, for example).  His eyes opened.  We count those moments as God's kindness in letting us see his eyes again and in giving doctors a reason to wait things out a bit.  Again, doctors are very honest about how small a sign that is scientifically.      So, we wait.  And we pray.  And we rejoice that we have this time with Rye's physical body here so that the beautiful body of believers can join us in the grieving, hoping, waiting, praying, crying, singing, laughing, eating, hugging, holding, touching walking, talking, etc.  We thank our Father that, Rye, who has no living grandparents and no relatives in the state has the biggest family ever imagined in the brothers and sisters in Christ who internationally are going before the throne of the Creator of the Universe daily on his behalf.  We know God can heal him here completely.  We pray He will.  Regardless, we trust His character that never changes and is always good, always for us, always faithful, always loving and always righteous.",158,985,2,160,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

It’s not everyday that you find out you have cancer. My name is Michelle Jannette Barroso, born and raised in San Francisco California and I just turned 48 years old this past June. I graduated from Immaculate Conception Academy, and then from Dominican College of San Rafael with my BSN. I am a registered nurse in Labor and Delivery at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. I’m the wife of Eduardo Barroso who is a carpenter and works for the city of San Francisco for MUNI, and the proud mother of three beautiful children; Melissa and Loreto who are both in college, and Cheree who is in high school. On June 16th I was alarmed to find 11 pea sized lumps around my neck. So that following Wednesday I scheduled a doctors appointment, just to be safe and say I had it checked out. The following week on Junes 26th, we received the results of my biopsy. They told me they had found Adenocarcinoma, I had Cancer. We conducted the necessary diagnostic tests to find out how severe my case was and where exactly in my body the cancer was. We were so convinced we had caught it early, I felt normal, no side effects, my electrolyte and metabolic panels all came back within normal range. Looking at me, you never would have guessed.On my 21st Wedding Anniversary, July 5th, my family and I went to Kaiser and received the devastating prognosis. I have stage 4 Metastatic Adenocarcinoma, and it has spread throughout my body. It is in the lymph nodes throughout my body, my mediastinum, esophageal junction, my liver, pancreas, stomach, lower hip bones, and my pelvic bones. The doctor told me that without treatment that I have 6 months, up to a year. I have always had a positive outlook on life. I’ve always promoted the whole power of intention, power of attraction, the secret, etc. So naturally I’m trying to think positive, but I have to admit, I am super scared. I don’t know what my future holds. All I know is that I am not ready to leave this world.After some research we found that in my case, chemotherapy would only increase my presumed time by 5%. So this is my plea for help. I have found that there are cures for cancer in other countries, treatments that are not made available here in the United States. Since they are treatments not offered here, my insurance will not cover it. That is where this GoFundMe comes into play. Please help me with my cause, anything helps, even a dollar, whatever you can afford. I want to help in finding the cure, make a difference, and tell my story to the world.

And it can change everything. As many as you may know our beloved Kim Klonaris was diagnosed with lymphoma this July, shortly after she was in Nassau caring for her mother who is currently battling breast cancer. It was a heavy blow. At 42, and in excellent health, no one could have ever imagined this would be a part of Kim’s journey. Naturally, the family has been completely thrown into a whirlwind. The lymphoma is Marginal zone low grade b-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and requires aggressive chemotherapy treatments - including some hospitalization. We are so grateful because the prognosis is good. However, Kim had to make the very hard decision for her to leave her precious 8 year old daughter Eleni, husband Charles, family, church and friend support system as well as her home and begin rigorous chemo and medical treatments in the US for the next two and a half months. Kim and Charles run a small airfreight business on island and now Kim is unable to work. Insurance covers some of her treatment but not all costs. Some of her cancer medicines out of hospital are not covered nor is travel, food and accommodation costs for family members who will be looking after Kim. In just over two short months, Charles and Kim have spent well over 10K out of pocket. Anyone who has faced a similar battle knows only too well how quickly it all adds up. Kim and family have been long time members of the Lucayan Presbyterian Kirk and have always generously supported charitable causes in our wonderful Freeport Community. She and her family are so kind and humble, always giving. She and her family have never asked … nor will they ever ask … for help, even though they need it. Sometimes, though, we have to stand in the gap. So, on behalf of all of Kim and Charles’ family, friends and all who have asked how they can help, I’m asking. This is going to be a very tough battle for Kim and her family. Physically, emotionally and financially. Tremendous love and support are needed. So true to the village we Grand Bahamians truly are, there have been many calls, emails, texts, prayers and messages of love and support. Many have asked how they can help and, for those in a position to do so, a donation is a tangible way to help them in the journey ahead. Every donation, in any amount, helps and is so very much appreciated. We are grateful for whatever help you can give – donation or otherwise. Most importantly, please keep the prayers coming - Kim is so strong in her faith and has found great comfort in all the prayers, love and support she has already received…thank you! The unexpected does happen. Amazingly, in the midst of the toughest battles come the most extraordinary – and unexpected - displays of faith, strength, perseverance, support and love. And, that changes everything. Please feel free to share this post to your Facebook page in an effort to get the word out. Let’s support our sweet Kim and let her focus on getting better.

As Christian brothers and sisters we have a unique way to help “Carry each other’s burdens” as they face uncertain times.On March 23, 2018 Jim was diagnosed with carcinoma in the base of his tongue over two inches wide with metastasis to nearby lymph nodes. This was after just a few weeks of some headaches, a sudden painful lump in his neck, and problems swallowing.  He is currently under the care of a team of specialists who are assessing the treatment regimens available.  He has completed a full body PET Scan and results will be forthcoming about the extent of any metastasis below his neck.  He had minor surgery March 26 to assist in the diagnosis and will again undergo surgery April 2 to install a chemotherapy port in his chest.  Daily radiation is planned for 6 to 7 weeks along with chemotherapy at various intervals.  Monday April 9th has been targeted for the beginning of radiation and chemo therapies. He has been told he will lose up to 80 pounds and it may become necessary for a feeding tube to be installed in his abdomen. Even at this point, before any treatment, he is in significant pain and is on measured amounts of morphine around-the-clock as well as hydrocodone.As you can imagine, Jim has quite a rocky road of therapy and healing ahead of him. The treatments and the side effects that go along with them dictate that he will have to cut back on much of his work during the next 6 to 8 months.  The oncologist has prepared him for a potentially longer period of adjustment as there are simply too many unknowns to be precise at this point.  Some of you are aware of Jim’s history of heart disease and heart attack and his success in overcoming of those trials.  Now he is facing the battle for his life.Between the expenses of the planned treatment and reduced capability to work, several of his friends have encouraged this GoFundMe campaign. You can imagine one of the many unrelenting stresses for Jim and Annette will be these questions: how can we go forward financially? With no disability insurance, how can we pay our bills? Can we afford the right therapies? Can we continue paying our insurance premiums?  Can we meet the ever-rising deductible? – the list is endless.Yet this is one area where we ALL can come together and help relieve some of these nagging concerns. With your donation we can let Jim & Annette focus on healing and living – and not waste precious emotional energy on finances. They have already begun steps to simplify their lives. Jim realizes this will be a defining life moment and will likely change the course of it. Simplicity will be good. So, they are making meaningful changes already:  they recognize the dire necessity of drastically cutting living expenses, including the possible sale of of their home in the future.  They have already begun to sell several possessions while at the same time assessing future work realities – all with an eye toward a healthier, less stressful, future.   Over the years they have been supportive, welcoming, friends to so many of us in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, Arkansas, and, of course, Memphis. As we all pray for the Father to bless Jim and Annette with healing, each of us also has an opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to relieve some of their concern in this most anxious time. You may support Jim & Annette with cards and well wishes sent directly to them through Facebook messenger.Thank you for supporting Jim & Annette with your continued prayers over this extended time. Scott MillsWinston-Salem, NC Blair BryanCharlotte, NC  ""Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

Your donations will immediately be used to pay for this genetic test that could determine the best course of action to treat her cancer. This will hopefully help get her back into class with her kindergarten kids, who she misses so much.  Kellie is and will be facing expensive medical bills in addition to her rent, car payments, insurance and other expenses.  She has never been one to ask for help unless it's absolutely necessary.  Any and all money received in this Go Fund Me account will be used for the current, pending, and future expenses not covered so she may continue to lead a semi-normal life while trying to get the treatment and help she needs.  In keeping with her love for kids, Kellie has determined any and all unneeded funds will be donated to St. Jude's Children's Hospital, so others even younger than she will also get the help they need and deserve.      Kellie, her family, and friends thank you in advance for all of your support.",366,1.1k,0,369,6 months,3 months ago,6 months,2018-09-03

I am a 44 year old mother of three children (JJ-5, Nyah-9, and Izzy-17). I need HELP!!! I’m trying to raise $300,000.000, half of which I  need ASAP for a deposit. I desperately need a surgery, Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, known as HIPEC. HIPEC is an up and coming surgery to treat different forms of abdominal cancers. I have a very rare and aggressive form of ADRENAL CANCER called Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC).  ACC is called a “Terrorist” cancer, an “Orphan” cancer. ACC is relentlessly aggressive and extremely rare. I have limited treatment options and very little time. I have been battling with ACC for 2 years. I am statistically approaching the end of my road. My Oncologist and I have exhausted every conventional form of treatment for my ACC. We started with surgery combined with radiation therapy and it returned in less than 2 months. After my recurrence in July of 2017, we hit it with almost a year of intense chemotherapy. A 3 chemo cocktail that has left me disabled and suffering from a pulmonary embolism. The embolism ended my remaining systemic chemo treatments. My tumors have responded well to the chemo, and there has been significant shrinkage, but the 4 tumors are still in the peritoneal lining of my abdomen. During HIPEC, what is left of my tumors will be removed, then Dr. Miller will apply heated chemo directly into my abdomen. I will be the very first ACC patient to be treated with HIPEC at the University of Michigan Cancer Center.  This treatment can give me years instead of months. Without this surgery, I will not live long enough to see my two youngest children finish grade school. I have insurance, my husband and I purchased our heath insurance through the ACA Marketplace, and I am grateful to the ACA. Without its protections for pre-existing conditions I wouldn’t have had the last 2 years with my family. Unfortunately, treatments provided out of network and out of state ARE NOT COVERED. Like I said before, my cancer is extremely rare and very aggressive, less than one in a million rare, and only three surgeons in the United States perform this surgery for ACC patients. I have started this Go Fund Me page because, like I said, my insurance won’t cover this cancer-busting procedure, and I am running out of time.With your help in funding this surgery, to be done by the ADRENAL CANCER research team at University of Michigan, HIPEC is my opportunity and small window to be with my family for hopefully many more years.

I know, from private conversations, he truly looks at these kids and parents as extended family members.  He truly loves watching all kids succeed-not just his own.  Xiomara has opened up her home to many families throughout the year and has willingly picked up the duties at home when Fred was spending a great deal of time helping others.  Lani, Fred and Xiomara are in need of all of our help.  Many loved ones are offering support in many ways and the last week has been incredible to see in terms of how good people can be when a family is brought to their knees.   The financial cushion that we are trying to raise will allow Fred and Xiomara to focus on Lani without the stress of worrying about finances.Lani is an incredible  soccer player who has excelled on the field as well as in the classroom.  Her smile is infectious and her good natured spirit has touched many.  She will beat this illness and come back stronger than ever!!!",328,1.2k,11,326,10 days,2 days ago,9 days,2018-09-03

He has a feeding tube but hopefully it will come out soon!!  The next step is at least 6 more weeks in the hospital, an intense couple of weeks of stroke therapy at an inpatient facility and most likely followed by an extended stay in a professional nursing facility where he will continue therapy until he is able to go home. We have a very long road ahead of us, but Jody has an AMAZING, MAGICAL, UNBELIEVEABLE group of friends and family that surrounds him.  With all that said, even with insurance medical bills can be a HUGE financial burden.

I'm here to ask you for your prayers and help as Andrew begins his brave journey to fight and BEAT Burkitt's Leukemia. Just three weeks ago, Melissa and Chris took Andrew to their pediatrician to diagnose and treat a lump on the side of his face. After two rounds of antibiotics and several stumped doctors, Andrew was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Days later, a battery of tests confirmed that he has stage four blood cancer.  Andrew received the first of many upcoming chemo treatments on Friday, March 30. Because the cancer is aggressive, doctors have put him on a chemo treatment plan that will last six to eight months, with most of his  time being spent at CHOP. We are optimistic that at the end of Andrew's journey, he will stand tall, proud, victorious and ready to continue his life as a survivor. In order for Melissa and Chris to provide the full time care and love so critical to Andrew's healing process, they need to work reduced hours, thus immediately foregoing their full time salaries for the duration of Andrew's treatment and recovery. To help them cover the lost wages and Andrew's increasing costs of medical care, I am kindly asking for your generosity. Every thought, prayer, positive vibe, and contribution will help Andrew stay strong and WIN. On behalf of the Trouts, Branyans, Tieders, and Andrew's extended family, I sincerely thank you for your show of support and standing by Melissa, Chris and Andrew's brothers, Conner (eight) and William (five) during this trying time.

The funds will be spent for the medical bills that cannot covered by their insurance, recovery cost they need after surgery, to help with daily expenses until he is able to go back to work, to help to heal their hearts, to help to heal both physically and mentally distressed. Also, please share this with family and friends as a warning that we all must be careful and vigilant of our surroundings.  This could have happened to anyone.  Masashige was truly in the wrong place at the wrong time!ハワイ在住のShokoと申します。2018年5月28日にカカアコ地区で日本人観光客のご家族に起きた暴行事件。私は当時、たまたま子供達を連れて事件の起こった公園に入った時ちょうど事件が起きた直後でした。遠くから見て、男性1人が血まみれで座り込んでおり周りにいた3名の方もパニック状態でいるのがすぐにわかったと同時に日本人観光客とすぐにわかったので、大丈夫ですかと声をかけました。そこから、ご家族と警察、救急隊員、病院のナースなど通訳としてヘルプさせて頂きながら事件の全てそしてご家族の状況を目の当たりにしました。ご家族はハワイ滞在最終日に、最近話題になっているカカアコ地区のウォールアートを見に来ていて、お父様の正茂さんがたまたま入った公園のトイレで事件が起きました。正茂さん曰く、トイレに入って間もなく襲われたそうでその瞬間から記憶が全くありません。様子がおかしい事に気付いた奥様の美穂さんがすぐに確認しようと後を追いましたがトイレに入る直前で別の誰かに背後から首を絞められその場で気絶してしまいました。息子さんと娘さんはこの時幸いにも公園外のウォールアートの写真をとっていて、事件後に駆けつけたそうです。正茂さんと美穂さんは救急車で緊急搬送され、応急処置や検査などを受けた後、約10日間程の入院になりそうと診断されました。正茂さんの怪我の状態:頬の骨陥没おでこ左側深い切り傷歯茎から折られる頭を支える骨にヒビが入った為、髄液が流出両目とも開かない程腫れがる精神的ダメージ美穂さんの怪我の状態:唇の損傷 首、顔面のあざ顔面の痛み精神的ダメージ今すぐにでも手術が必要とされる中、不運にも海外旅行保険に加入されていなかった為に莫大な治療費となってしまい、事件翌日の飛行機で怪我を負ったまま日本へ帰るしかない状況に置かれてしまいました。幸いにも無事に日本に到着し、空港からまっすぐ病院へ向かい、正茂さんは緊急入院となりました。検査の方も進み、思った以に酷い状況であることが発覚し、次の手術予定日が6月9日と決まっています。集まった募金は私が責任を持って100%全て田村さんご家族に送ります。保険適用にならない分のハワイでかかった治療費、病院代、手術後の手当て、心の治療、お仕事に復帰できるようになるまでの日々のコストなど、そしてお見舞金として使われる予定です。私の周りのローカル達が、田村さんご家族の為にたくさんのアロハを送ってあげようと言ってくれて一緒に決めたゴール金額です。せっかくの家族ハワイ旅行でまさかこんな事件にあってしまうなんて、誰も想像すらできません。ハワイ在住の方、日本在住の方、世界中の方々、1円でも構いませんのでどうかサポートして頂けると嬉しいです！募金で集まった金額100%全て田村さんご家族に寄付されます。どうかよろしくお願いいたします。",719,7.5k,8,708,3 months,9 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,38,Faiths Final Hope,https://www.gofundme.com/5n8fxfk,"CAPTAIN COOK, HI","June 6, 2018","$35,000","$43,865","Hello My Name is Renee, I am one of Faith long term friends. Many of you are personal friends of Faith and are familiar with her story and love her dearly. We absolutely need a miracle for Faith in the next couple of weeks. For those of you who have or have not followed Faith’s healing journey here’s what’s happening: Faith needs your financial help! There is nothing more that her Oncologist or Surgeon can do for her, she is in the lates stages of Stage 4 Mestatic Breast Cancer. Because it has already metastasized, ( spread to her spine ) It has the potential to spread very quickly to her major organs, it’s hard to say exactly how long she has. She is in the process of phasing our out of her job, as her health is seemingly declining. We don’t know how long she has, it could be just a series of months. Needless to say she is in need of a miracle. Faith has been accepted as a patient for experimental treatment at CHIPSA Hospital. This treatment will cost $33,427.17 This will cover 3 weeks of inpatient treatment, 3 meals a day, her own room, and covers the cost of an extra room and 3 meals a day for her travel companion. CHIPSA hospital has a lot of long standing integrity with Cancer.  https://chipsahospital.org/Faith has chosen this hospital because of the many first hand reports she has heard through the years in regard to their high results with cancer. CHIPSA has much higher results with cancer treatment for individuals with compromised immune systems........Of these Therapies are two in particular: IPT and the Vallovax Vaccine. IPT is low dose chemo assisted with Insulin, because cancer cells have more insulin receptors on them than healthy cells the chemo bypasses the healthy cells and only kills the cancer cells! Yay ! No hair falling out ! The Vallovax vaccine has received a lot of media coverage lately. 80-95% of clinical trials are seeing cancer patients with late stage disease with a clean bill of health, and with no side effects?! CHIPSAs hospital is only 23 miles south of sandiego, just over the border in Tiujuana. Faith has interviewed with her agent Kim, in addition to Dr Castillo her attending Physician. They have offered her 3 week opening available immediately. She has been approved for a comprehensive late stage cancer treatment program. She is most encouraged about the Vallovax Vaccine , it is anti angiogenic in nature and it is destroying cancer by: “reducing the growth of new blood vessels needed by tumors to grow and metastasize” It basically starves the tumors from their energy source and they die! The hospital is reporting that patients aren’t needing as much IPT because the Vallovax vaccine is having so much substantial success ! Overview- ( for those who need the back story) Faith was Diagnosed in July 2017 with stage 4 Breast Cancer. Faith’s White Blood cell count was dangerously low prior to starting any treatment. Her Oncologist says she has a condition called Leukopenia. This is where your white cell count is so low that even your own bodies bacteria can become dangerous to you. This makes Faith a risky candidate for chemo, Chemo greatly reduces your white blood cell count. Many people do not realize that it’s not the chemo that kills off the entirety of the cancer, it is the immune systems job to do so. I share this to clarify why Faith was never a candidate for typical Cancer therapy. Faith also has had a 9 year history of complicated auto immune diagnoses, there were years when she was so ill she couldn’t work. So now you have a better idea of why she needs to pursue this experimental treatment. Please consider donating or becoming a fundraiser yourself . If 350 people could find a way to raise 100$ from their friends and family , we could knock this out as quickly as possible and potentially save her life ! Sadly this is a life and death situation. We ask that everyone please share this post and more specifically if you would consider being a fundraiser yourself and gathering funds from you’re circle. If we get to the $35,000 mark Faith can go immediately...let’s get it done in three days and save her life!!",268,1.3k,5,303,2 months,4 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

My nephew, Juan Fernando Salaverria, an 18 year old salvadoran, needs to undergo surgery during the second week of July 2018 and we need your help, besides your empathy and prayers. Juan Fer was born in 1999 withTetralogy of Fallot, absence of pulmonary valve and detached pulmonary artery. There are only a few doctors and hospitals in the world that can, to this day,  perform the surgery because of its complexity.  Dr. Evan Zahn is his doctor (currently based in Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles)who together with Redmond Burke saved his life in1999. As a matter of fact, his condition was so rareback then and his odds for survival so low, that theMiami Herald published an article about him titled“A miracle of the Heart”. We gave everything forhim, not only emotionally, but also financially.Juan’s birth was supposed to be one of joy, the firstgrandson in our family. His mother was fully covered by insurance, but things changed radically when Juan was born with an undetected congenitaldisease. All of these medical procedureswere out of pocket expenses, since the insurancecompany denied coverage due to his congenitalcondition. After two open heart surgeries andseven catheterisms, plus the loss of sight in one of his eyes he needs another intervention.Two days ago we got the hospital’s quotation for his procedure. $89,000.00 We are not financially prepared for that and are turning to you to support us in finding themanner in which we might raise the necessary funds.  A child’slife, an amazing child’s life is at stake. We beg you, from our hearts,from my families’ and from our country of El Salvador’sprayers, where Juan has been an example of resilience, faithand hope, to help us. These funds will be used to paybfor his procedure  scheduled to bebon July 17 2018 Mi nombre es Adriana Hill y soy de El Salvador. Mi sobrino Juan Fernando Salaverria es un joven de 18 años que nació con Tetralogía de Fallo, ausencia de válvula pulmonar y de una arteria pulmonar. En la segunda semana de julio de este año debe de someterse a un cateterismo para poder reemplazar la válvula pulmonar que actualmente tiene. Solo hay un par de doctores en el mundo que actualmente realizan este procedimiento debido a su complejidad. El Dr. Evan Zahn es el doctor de Juan Fernando (actualmente trabaja en el Cedar Sinaí Hospital de Los Ángeles) quien junto con el Dr. Raymond Burke salvaron la vida de Juan Fernando en 1999. La condición con la que nació Juan Fernando era tan rara y su probabilidad de sobrevivir tan baja que el Miami Herald publicó un artículo sobre  llamado ""Un Milagro del Corazón"". Desde ese momento sus padres y el resto de su familia han dado todo para sacar adelante a Juan Fer no solo emocionalmente pero también  económicamente. Al momento de nacer, la mamá de Juan Fernando contaba con seguro médico, pero al ser la enfermedad de índole congénita, las cosas cambiaron drásticamente. Todos los procedimientos a los que se ha sometido Juan Fernando han sido pagados al 100% por la familia ya que la aseguradora le negó cobertura alguna. Después de dos cirugías de corazón abierto, siete cateterismos y la perdida completa de un ojo, Juan Fer necesita otra intervención. Hace unos días recibimos la cotización del hospital por el procedimiento $89,000.00.  No estamos preparados económicamente para esta situación por eso buscamos de su apoyo para encontrar la manera de poder ayudar a Juan Fernando.

Medical,38,Strong for Rowan: Battling Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/Strong-for-Rowan,"LONG BEACH, CA","April 28, 2018","$40,000","$38,230","On behalf of Matthew Haynes, Abigail Haynes and family.This page is not intended solely for financial reasons. It may also serve as a platform for those to show love and support to baby Rowan and those who go above and beyond to care for him.  Those who choose to support through V E N M O: @mwhaynesOur fight with cancer: Our son, Rowan, was diagnosed with stage III Ganglioneuroblastoma at 15 months of age on March 2nd, 2018. An intermixed mass of cancerous and benign cells forming a tumor larger than a grapefruit was growing in his pelvis out toward his abdomen.  After two cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer was unresponsive and the only treatment left was surgery. On April 26th, the amazing surgical staff at Miller Children’s Hospital in Long Beach was able to perform a miracle. They took out 90% of the mass even though it was incasing his aorta and inferior vena cava. While considered overly successful, they could not safely remove the mass inside his spinal column and sacrum.Our fight isn’t over:  While the best possible outcome was achieved during surgery, our battle with cancer is far from complete. Depending on the type of tissue that still remains in his body and how well he recovers from surgery, he will still need a lot of treatment. He might need additional chemotherapy and maybe even radiation. Rowan will eventually need physical, occupational, and speech therapy to catch up on his milestones. Our oncology team estimates that his treatment will take anywhere from 6-12 months; we have been in the pediatric intensive care unit for only two months so far. As of April 28, 2018, he is still fighting hard in the surgical recovery stage of his treatment roadmap.Why we need your support: Plainly stated, we want to be able to ensure Rowan is being well taken care of. We also want to be able to support those who go out of their way to care for him. Rowan requires us to be by his side at all times in the hospital so we won’t be actively earning income. These donations will help us maintain his care and comfort. My awesome employer has given my family so much already, but those amazing benefits cannot last forever. All monies donated will be used for the treatment, care, comfort, and support of Rowan and those who care for him.For more detailed information on our son’s condition and treatment, scroll down for the whole story.The Haynes Family thanks you from the bottom of our hearts!Feel free to contact me at matthewhaynes@kpmg.com or mhaynes15@yahoo.com￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The Story: We took Rowan to our pediatrician on March 1st, 2018 because he was being extremely fussy during the past week. He wouldn’t eat, sleep, or crawl. Rowan would just whimper instead. We thought it was an ear ache and teething but our doctor was more concerned about how bloated his belly was. She ordered tests: blood, stool, and an ultrasound.  Later that evening around 7 o’clock, we got a call from her telling us to go to the ER because Rowan's lab results were extremely abnormal. Most notably, his calcium was >15mg/dL (Severe hypercalcemia). That trip to the ER would change our lives forever.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Soon after we get to the ER, an abdominal ultrasound revealed that he had a huge mass growing in his belly.  We were admitted to the Pediatric ICU. From there, as if almost on cue, he started to developed severe diarrhea. He would end up losing about 3 to 4 liters of stool everyday.  Confounded by what could be causing the stooling, the PICU team could only treat the extreme electrolyte imbalances and dehydration until the MRIs would reveal what was truly inside. After a week, the MRI was presented to us by the pediatric oncology team. The mass was a lot larger than expected and appeared to be growing from his sacrum to his belly button; it was 12x10x12cm. It was compressing his stomach and bladder, and pushing his intestines toward his ribs. Tumor and bone marrow biopsies needed to be taken in order to give us a definitive diagnoses. Our worst fears came to fruition.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The diagnosis was Ganglioneuroblastoma: Stage III Cancer.  It is a very rare cancer that has benign and malignant growths intermixed. The cancer was also emitting a hormone (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) that caused him to have severe diarrhea; even if he had nothing to eat or drink, he would still have watery stool. At the time, the edpidemiologists thought the dysentery was from a contagious disease, so Rowan was put on isololation for most of the time. In essence, he was forced to stay in his crib for weeks, which was horrible. The diarrhea posed a huge challenge because it resulted in Rowan having his blood tested every four hours so that they could replace his electrolytes and fluids. Eventually, he had to have a semi-permanent central line placed under his collar bone for easy access to blood and meds. He also had a feeding tube inserted through his nostril.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The plan of attack was to have two cycles of chemotherapy then check to see if the tumor had shrunk. Surgery would have been the first option but the surgical team was worried that the tumor was too vascular (bloody) and chemotherapy would hopefully kill some of the vasculature.  So, we treated the cancer with two rounds. A total of 42 days worth of inpatient therapy in the pediatric oncology ward. Eventually, Rowan's instability would bring us back to the Pediatric ICU where we would call home for most of the stay. They treated him as well they could.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼After the first round of chemotherapy, preliminary signs indicated that the tumor was not shrinking and everything we did to slow the stooling wasn't working. We continued to give his second round of chemotherapy with different drugs to ensure that we covered all angles. After many blood transfusions, anti-nausea/pain medications, and diaper changes later, we finally take another MRI to see the results of chemo. In short, the results were not good. The MRI indicated that the tumor was unresponsive and actually grew just a few CMs. This was a hard pill to swallow. What was even more devastating was the MRI revealed that the tumor mass was incasing the two main arteries from the heart. The tumor was also being fed blood by three other arteries. This news was devastating to us. The only bright side was that flu restrictions were lifted and Rowan’s big sister, McKenzie, got to see him for the first time after two months.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The remaining treatment was surgery; to get as much of the mass out of him as possible. The problem was that removing the mass could be lethal and that only 50% could be taken out safely.  On April 26, 2018 Rowan endured a 6.5 hour surgery that required every pediatric surgeon in the hospital. We were told that 5 surgeons worked simultaneously on him. We were blessed and relieved that a miracle was performed that day and 90% of the tumor was removed. Everyone's prayers and support and love and kindness were answered. Tears of joy were shed by family, nurses, and doctors alike that day. But our battle is far from over. Only a few days into his recovery we are seeing the struggle that remains. He has a long road ahead with treatment to follow. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼We will keep you all updated!Thank you from the very bottom of our hearts.",408,547,32,405,4 months,18 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

They could not figure out why and did a spinal surgery thinking that was it. She kept getting weaker and had a fall in Dec 2016, breaking her ankle in three places. In early 2017, she continued losing mobility and by September she could no longer stand. In September, they finally gave us the diagnosis but it was definitely not what we were hoping for...it is ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). They say the average lifespan from the first symptoms is 2-4 years and we can definitely see the progression as she is almost bed bound 24/7. But Mary is still dedicated to trying to ‘Stephen Hawking‘ the crap outta this!The cost of paying for a full time caregiver is pretty incredible and we are still on the waiting list to get Medicare to pay for some of it. In addition to Mary's healthcare costs, she has started her inevitable decline, being mostly bedbound every day, losing the use of even her hands, and now her voice is becoming difficult to understand clearly. She also is needing respiration in order to sleep and keep oxygen flowing properly.  Ted has to work during the day to keep the ship afloat.  And after buying a handicapped van in October, the medical expenses are starting to mount again for us.If you are in a position to help, it is super appreciated.  We are thankful that we have a full lifetime to remember together.  Living in London, helping her get into Stanford, working at our startup GoTo together, years of watching our kids grow up. Now that she has pretty much only her memories left, we are dedicated to helping her as much as we are able. Thank you her friends and family for all of the laughter and memories.  Mary is dedicated to helping others even in this difficult time - and we've put together a blog with all her lists of life tips .  Check it out!You can also check out this amazing video that a close friend had made at our Team Mary party.  It's a very touching way to see how Mary has touched all our lives.Sending love from Mary.",74,22,3,73,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

She wanted to help people naturally improve their lives so that they may be healthier and live more prosperously. 5 years ago, she beat bone cancer in her left leg,  now that cancer is back and she needs our support. This time it has come back as a mass on the outside of her lung, causing her intense pain due to all the nerve endings in that area of the body. The doctors believe that it is is localized to that area, but are recommending some rather intensive chemotherapy options as well as large scale surgeries to get her back to her healthy. Although it hurts feeling like we cannot do anything to help her, there actually is a means of assistance.... By supporting her through this fundraiser and sharing this with your network, this will tremendously help her by allowing her parents and loved ones provide all the accommodations for her through this process. There will be many medical costs to get her through this.

In January, Laura’s scans showed that there was no evidence of disease. Despite this, Laura was adamant that another scan be taken in mid-August to confirm that she was cancer free. While doctors noted an additional scan wasn’t needed, her persistence won and the scan was performed.As a shock to us all, on August 23, 2018 Laura and Michael received the devastating news that the scan showed a concerning spot on her liver. Laura’s doctors are confident that this lesion signifies a recurrence of her cancer and therefore, at the beginning of September, Laura will have the lesion removed and sent out for testing. This recurrence would put her at stage 4 cancer which means that more creative methods need to be put into place to ensure Laura has the strongest possibility to beat this. So many people have reached out to show their love and support, and to ask about ways they can help. This Go Fund Me Page is a way to help Laura and Michael access the care, resources, and lifestyle they need to give them all the strength to continue to fight like hell. Beyond cancer being devastating, it is expensive. Insurance will cover the scans, the surgeries, etc. but ALL other supplementary expenses are out of pocket. New costs pop up every day, but here is what we know they can expect soon. Those costs that are known for certain are listed below, however there are some costs we are not exactly sure of yet. Western Medicine- COBRA costs due to Laura carrying the insurance prior to the loss of her job earlier this year ($1600/month)- Flights to and from hospitals for second opinions, treatment, etc. (airline tickets will cost at least $300 each time they travel, not including hotel costs and other costs associated with being away from home)- Research on her lesion performed by Foundation One (a sample of her lesion will be sent out for testing to determine the type of cancer she is dealing with so she can best fight it)- Functional medicine expenses - A consult Dr. Nasha Winters who uses natural medicine to target stage 4 cancer successfully ($500 for just the consult, not including ongoing treatment) Eastern Medicine- Acupuncture 2x a week ($31 each session)- Natropath doctor visits twice a month ($200 each visit)- A treatment facility to focus on detoxification and finding the root cause of her cancer (approx. $10K, depending on the facility)- Research by Sator Therapeutics – Cost is TBD but likely in the thousands (this is a personalized approach to treatment in Europe that would allow Laura to receive a customized treatment based on her specific type of cancer)  - Additional exploratory medicine expenses that arise (This will be the driving cost of treatment going forward as Laura needs to determine the root cause of her cancer and be vigilant in her approach to treatment)- Mistletoe injections ($180 monthly)Lifestyle- Regular massage treatments ($40 each session)- Organic groceries weekly in lieu of a meal train or other meals dropped off ($200) – Laura is on a very strict diet and this will allow her to maintain it- Supplements ($180 a month)Despite the stage 4 diagnosis, Laura and Michael are confident that they can beat this. People live for many years and go into remission with this diagnosis, but this type of success requires a lot of work, exploration, alternative medicine, and the expenses that go along with it all. This Go Fund Me page will help to ensure that Laura and Michael can focus on her treatment and have relief from some of the expenses that will come their way in the future Following the removal of this mass in early September, we will know, for certain, if this is cancerous. Because the doctors believe it is, we would like to give Laura and Michael a jump start on the upcoming expenses. If, for some reason, the results of the test indicate that this mass is not cancerous, all funds will be refunded Thank you in advance for your generosity, love, and support.",338,499,0,337,7 days,6 days ago,6 days,2018-09-03

Adrian is 21 years young and loves being around race horses and has a passion for  these beautiful animals. He grew up around them since the day he was born. Unfortunately on Saturday morning while working horses at Santa Anita Race Track he went down in a bad spill and was not able to get up. He was rushed to Huntington Memorial Hospital where they confirmed he had broken his back, broken ribs and he has no sense of feeling from the waist down. He will be going in for surgery within the next couple days on his spine in hopes for things to turn around. As we all know there will be medical bills and lots of therapy which is why we have created this to try to help out with him and the family. Any donation is very much appreciated.

Medical,39,Adaptive van for Nick,https://www.gofundme.com/VanforNick,"SNOHOMISH, WA","July 3, 2018","$35,000","$37,785","Please help Nicholas' family afford a van so he can be safely transported when they need to leave the home.Adaptive vans are needed to  safely transport medically complex and physically disabled people to and from doctor’s and therapy appointments. It also helps them have the ability to experience life outside of the home. Nicholas is a two year old deeply affected by cerebral palsy. He can't do things like sit up without assistance, lift his arms or push up to help those caring for him move him from place to place. He's a tall boy for his age and the risk of injury is high for both him and caregivers. Getting a van with the right equipment will help transfer him more safely than out of a car seat in a typical vehicle. Kids like Nick have bulky, heavy medical equipment, and if it's not used as intended, expensive repairs are needed. This happens when components that aren't intended to be broken apart need to be in order to fit into a car to go to multiple appointments, sometimes in the same day. Nick's family has some important visits to the Seattle Children's Hospital scheduled later in the summer with  specialists and they have to bring equipment that doesn't fit in their car.Nick's family will soon be selling their small SUV and hope to buy an adaptive van, but they need your help.RECENT VISIT TO DEALER TO SEE HOW NICK'S CHAIR FITSThis is Nick's story, told by his Mom and Dad:In June of 2016, my husband and I received a phone call that a little boy was born many states away to an unprepared mother and that the baby needed a family. We had been chosen for the task if we could quickly decide to take him. After a surprisingly short discussion and a long flight to meet him, it was obvious that Nick was meant to be our son. Because we had gotten him ""overnight"", our community rallied around us and started delivering clothing, strollers, a crib; almost everything we needed showed up miraculously at our doorstep in those early days.A few short months later, our perfect baby started to slip in meeting milestones and started exhibiting what medical professionals called ""hypertonicity"". He was unable to turn his head easily to the left and his leg and arm muscles were consistently tight. He also started having issues bottle feeding and he barely slept. The hardest part about the first few months was not knowing what was happening with him and feeling like we weren't giving him what he needed. Typical new parents, right? What we didn't know at that time is that Nick's brain had suffered a stroke early on in the pregnancy and he had a condition called bilateral schizencephaly  with polymicrogyria . When we received his diagnosis at 6 months of age, we were told that he probably wouldn't walk and that controlling his seizures and muscle tone would be life-saving as he grew.NICK'S FIRST EEG, WHERE HIS SEIZURE DISORDER WAS CONFIRMEDThe first year of his life was deeply disorienting for us and filled with hospital admissions, trips to the ER, trials and errors with feeding tubes, procedures, tests, sleepless nights and mastering a whole new vocabulary. We learned the difference between OT and PT, balanced appointments in the home and in-clinic and we signed him up for every service we could afford, leveraging the Early Intervention's Birth to 3 services. As his mother, I was unable to return to work and filled my time with going to support groups, hiring dependable caregivers and even attending seminars about neuroplasticity. Kids like Nick need help re-wiring the brain to use their muscles, including those supporting vision, so they can have hope for some sort of ""normal"" life.NICK AFTER HIS FIRST MEDICAL PROCEDURE TO GET A FEEDING TUBE, HELD BY DADAs symptoms of his brain disorder, Nick has cerebral palsy, intractable epilepsy, cortical vision impairment and other symptoms like trouble swallowing and digesting food. He doesn't use any words to communicate. He's followed by over 15 doctors and we see 6 therapists - Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Vision Therapists - either weekly or monthly either in our home or in clinics.What my husband's health insurance doesn't cover has been paid out of pocket so far. Big expenses are looming because he's such a big boy and because he can't help us move him at all.  Expensive things like adding tracks in the ceiling to support his weight as we move him safely from one room to an adaptive bathroom - not yet built - or removing steps and replacing them with ramps to roll his chair. We need to find a space in home to accommodate durable medical equipment like his activity chair, an adaptive stroller or foam wedges to support him during vision therapy. He'll soon get a ""stander"" to help him bear weight so his hips can develop enough to avoid surgery.TWO OF THE PIECES OF LARGE EQUIPMENT WE NEED TO TRANSPORTThe tricky thing about medical equipment is that it's bulky and heavy. Not only do we need to protect our bodies as he grows but we need to protect the integrity of the equipment by not breaking it down when it needs to go with him to appointments. The retail cost of one of his pieces of equipment alone is over $7,000 and if it breaks, there are limited options for loaners. The process of getting the blue chair in the picture above through the local children's hospital, including insurance approvals, took almost 7 months!We've waited as long as possible to buy an adaptive van to safely transport Nick and his heavy medical equipment. Soon, he won't sit in a car seat and instead, his chair will be strapped down inside a van for transport. By purchasing a properly adapted one, we'll be able to roll Nick into it and reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the chairs. If you have ever shopped for a van, you know that they can be costly. If you add the conversion package, the cost is between $60,000 to $80,000 for a new one. The conversion offers essential features for families like ours, like:-    A wheelchair ramp that automatically retracts from the vehicle after the van is lowered closer to the ground. You might have seen this with buses being lowered to accommodate a passenger with physical limitations. -    Modular seating that can be easily removed to add space for large equipment or a disabled passenger in the front when they're old enough. Why should a person who would typically ride up front be pushed to the back of a van simply because they can't open a door and sit in the front seat?-    Illumination on the floors to see where you're working on tying down chairs or when you drop things like syringes while meds are administered.We've been setting aside money to buy the van but other expenses are adding up:  adapting our home, hiring additional caregivers so we can both work to afford therapies and treatments. So, we're asking for some help. We're lucky to have a fair, family-run and owned local dealership  in our area but we really need some help putting part of the money down to be able to afford the monthly payment.It's very hard to ask for help so publicly but we've been encouraged to do so by some of his doctors and therapists and we all need help from time to time.Thank you listening to our family's story and for your support. Even if you can't contribute financially, sharing our story with your friends and family or leaving a kind note is always appreciated. You can share the link by email, phone, Facebook or Twitter:   www.gofundme.com/VanforNick. Or, you can just use"" share buttons"" and mention why Nick's story inspired you to donate or share.Thank you again,Nick's Mom and Dad, Nick J.",306,1.1k,17,302,2 months,12 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

The next day, she suffered from a 104-degree fever, a headache, nausea, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was taken to urgent care, where they eventually couldn’t find a blood pressure, and then she was rushed to the emergency room.Somehow, Diane had contracted an infection during the sinus surgery that had quickly become septic(bacterial infection in blood stream). She was taken into an emergency surgery, where her entire large colon and part of her small bowel were removed. She then spent almost two weeks in the ICU, unable to see her sons, and was taken back to surgery for an illeostomy and given a feeding tube (peg) as well. She wasn’t able to speak again until she was extubated on June 17th—her first words were, ""Happy Father's Day.""Because the infection became septic so drastically, Diane no longer has use of her fingers and feet, but she can currently stand briefly on her left foot. She struggles through having her wounds dosed with alcohol, wrapped, and unwrapped multiple times a day. She is also still suffering from a swollen small intestinal area with gas and stomach pains, a clogged feeding tube, anxiety, and minimal sleep. She is enduring physical therapy trying to regain mobility with hopes of returning home to her boys, husband, and the community that she knows and loves.The doctors are advising amputation. There is a possibility of hand transplants and a right below-the-knee amputation, as well as an partial amputation on her left foot. The doctors are also hopeful that more can be done to improve her small intestine, bar any more infections or setbacks. However, most of the above won’t be covered by her insurance or social security. The current estimate for what she’d have to pay out of pocket is over $500,000.The insurance will pay to put Diane in a nursing home, but refuses to pay for at-home health care, prosthetics, or the necessary procedures. The worst case would be Diane being placed in a nursing home at 35 years old, where she could only get visitation from her boys and husband after school and work, but would no longer be able to live with them. The family has yet to hear back from Medicaid, but we’re hoping that Diane will be accepted so that she and her sons can have some insurance if she were no longer to have insurance from her job due to her condition.We are asking for donations to this GoFundMe page to help pay off her medical bills that the insurance won’t cover, and for the ability to receive any prosthetics or at-home care she’s going to need moving forward.Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance for anything you can give.  Any little bit will help, even something as small as the price of a cup of coffee.  Please share to spread the word even if you can’t help monetarily!We thank God for His many blessings and that Diane is alive and can still hug her boys with her arms and talk to them. Through this whole ordeal her faith in God and multiple prayer group-support from Open Door Church, where she volunteers and where her boys to go to school and support has been a tremendous help. We thank everyone who has prayed and for the many churches across North Carolina, her family, and her friends that have gotten her this far.All funds raised will be withdrawn in a special bank account on behalf of Diane and the family.  Paula Loftin will work to oversee the withdrawals of the funds.",345,2.3k,15,338,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

As of this new posting, we have collectively raised about $32,000 to support our longtime friend and favorite bartender in his most challenging year. I am happy to have spent a couple of days with Nasso this past week in the beginning of August, around and in my swimming pool, a scenario neither of us could have imagine even two weeks ago. It is a convenient place for him to begin a long process of rehab in tandem with his other physical therapy routines. He is in good spirits but still trying to process all the life changing events that have occurred these past 9 months.The good news about his bone marrow biopsy being negative was a big deal of course. He is still waiting on an additional report regarding the possible presence of an aberrant “t” cell that would make him more vulnerable in the future. Fingers crossed.In any case, Nasso will not be rejoining the work force anytime soon. The neuropathy in his legs, a direct result of the extensive chemotherapy, have disabled him. His once powerful arms and hands will need a lot of time and determination to recover. He has always been a physical guy and is ready and thankful to be able to get after it.Nasso is more than grateful for this Go Fund Me site. Our initial goal has been reached. But the future is still very uncertain for him. Up until now, Rancho Nicasio was able to cover his health insurance. He now has to rely on COBRA, which costs around $800 a month. Disability may help with his other living expenses for a while, but it’s just a situation nobody wants to be in.So I’m going to leave this site up for the immediate future and raise our goal.Your generosity has been exceptional.

She faced  this horrible disease 4 1/2 years ago and beat it, but on March 20th was given the heartbreaking news that it had returned. A lot has changed since Kendall's first battle with cancer. She got married, became a mother to my beautiful granddaughter, Sofia, and has continued her career. Kendall first noticed a lump under her arm about a month ago and immediately contacted her oncologist. He ordered a PET scan to check for any tumors she might have and also ordered a needle extraction biopsy. After the results of both tests were in, it was confirmed that the Hodgkin's Lymphoma was back.  She has a key lime sized tumor in her armpit, an orange sized tumor next to her heart and a small tumor under her collarbone. Kendall had a central line (port) surgically implanted in her chest on March 28th. This is how the chemo will be administered to her during treatment. Kendall will undergo 9 weeks of aggressive outpatient chemo in her hometown of Medford, Oregon starting next week. As soon as the chemo is complete she will undergo another PET scan to confirm that the chemo has killed the tumors. Next, Kendall will be moved to Portland, Oregon to get an even more aggressive chemo that will be given to her over 6 consecutive days. We were told she can expect the side effects from this treatment to be the harshest of anything she has faced to date, and will certainly cause her to lose her hair. Then the final and most brutal treatment will happen immediately after. The final treatment is a full bone marrow transplant that will remove all of Kendall's bone marrow, treat it with medication and her own stem cells and then return it to her body. This treatment will happen over a 4 week period and will put her white blood cell count at zero. Kendall's body will not have the ability to fight off even the weakest germs so this will be a very delicate time for her and our family. Kendall will be isolated from everyone except for her mother and I, who will care for her during the treatment and the 2 week recovery.  This will be a very rough time for her as she won't be able to have any contact with Sofia during this time.The funds we raise for her will be used to cover all of the outrageously expensive medical costs before, during and after her treatment that we already know her insurance won't cover. It will also be used for travel expenses to and from Portland, the 6 week housing for Kendall during the bone marrow transplant and recovery, and help with living expenses while Kendall is unable to work, which may be as long as 6 months. Kendall's husband Fily is working hard as a full time nursing student which makes it impossible for him to work at this time, so Kendall is the sole provider for her new family.For all of you that know me, this is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I am a person that loves to give to others but at the same time find it so hard to ask for help, but this is an urgent situation. So from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of my entire family, I thank you for any support you can give.  Please share this link and continue to pray for my angel, Kendall Joy.",113,366,2,120,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

When my oncologist told us that our best hope is flying to Switzerland for treatment, we decided to say yes without knowing how we would pull it off. It almost reminds me of the “trust fall,” where you fall backwards and believe that someone will be back there to catch you. In this case, our family, friends and a lot of people who we don’t even know not only caught us, but lifted us up more than we can believe. The amount of funds raised in a matter of hours and days was stunning. I never would have believed that we’d have this kind of response, especially after many of you have already given to us in the past. It seems like every day on every television channel and every internet story, we are told how divided we are in this country for a variety of reasons. To me - this has been the ultimate reminder that people really are good. A large community that is united by compassion and kindness has lifted us up when we needed it the most. A community, by the way, made up of people in many states, several countries, men and women, straight and gay, Republicans and Democrats, young and old, etc. It will be impossible for us to ever thank this community of kindness in a way that feels like enough. But from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate what each one of you has done for us. Whether it was a donation, sending us a dinner, saying a prayer, giving a hug on a tough day, or just being a friend, this community has meant everything to us - and I thank you. We will do our very best to pay your kindness forward in as many ways as we can in the future.So here we are - in Switzerland. I will be admitted into the hospital tomorrow morning, and will stay until Thursday. I want this treatment to be successful for the obvious reasons, but I also feel some strange pressure to make all of your support worth it. I know that’s a little crazy, but I don’t want to let everyone down. Once I’m injected with the isotope, I will literally be radioactive. Nobody (including Anne) will be able to be around me for a day and a half. People experience a wide range of side effects, so I’m not sure what to expect. I’m both excited about the treatment and also already nervous about the future results. We will keep you posted on how it goes. Thanks again and I love you all!-ScottUPDATE:**Thanks to your generosity, we were able to meet our initial goal in less than a day!! Since the interest in helping has been so high, we will continue and any additional funds will go towards Scott’s second and third treatments that will come to a total of $36,000.  We are overwhelmed by the response and I know that Scott and Anne are as well. **Our brother Scott continues his courageous battle with cancer.  With his wife Anne and son Alec by his side, he has fought every day.  His best option for treatment at this point takes them to Switzerland.  We are hoping to raise enough to help him pay for his first treatment and anything additional will go toward subsequent treatments (he has to go 3 times).   We want them to be able to focus on getting the best treatment he can and enjoying every day without worrying about medical and traveling costs.  When we approached Scott about additional fundraising, he finally agreed but only if we would add a personal letter to you all.  We have attached the letter below.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  As a family, we appreciate all your support.Renee & MichelleHi Friends and Family,First, we want to thank all of you who have offered to set up a fundraising site for us.

Since my diagnosis, we have gotten so much support.  People have set up fundraisers for us over the last few years.  There were times when we thought we had been given way too much and would eventually need to donate it to a non-profit.   However, this journey turned out to be more challenging (and more expensive) than we realized.    Our eyes are now wide-open to healthcare in America, and people with rare diseases are really in a tough spot. Luckily, we have you.  Trust me, without you all I might not be here today.  And if I were, we certainly would not still be living in our house or be able to send Alec to daycare.   We cannot thank everyone enough for all of the prayers and support.  We absolutely could not do it without you.   Up until now I have been able to see the best specialists in the country at MD Anderson in Texas and James Cancer Center in Ohio.  I have tried several clinical trials, but the cancer has continued to act very aggressively.   All of the specialists agree that my best chance now is a full body radiation procedure called PRRT.   It is an amazing treatment that can target all of the bone tumors in my body (I have many, many of them now).  It has been approved by the FDA for the more common types of neuroendocrine cancers, but not for mine.  Since insurance does not cover anything not approved by the FDA – we’re out of luck.  Believe it or not, it is less expensive to go to another country and pay out of pocket for the procedure than it is to get it here at the hospital in Pittsburgh without help from insurance.   We have made the decision to go to Basel, Switzerland to get the first round of PRRT.  The first treatment alone will be $12,000 (there are 3 treatments overall, 10 weeks apart), and there will obviously be significant travel expenses.  The cost is high, and it was not an easy decision for me, but I feel like no matter what happens, Alec has to know that I did everything that I possibly could to spend more time with him.  And besides, I haven’t given up yet. And I don’t plan on it.   We want you to know that you have already done your part.   Nobody should feel like they need to contribute again.  We love you all so much for everything that you have already done and nothing will change that.   We agreed to this because many are asking what else they can do, and honestly – we need some help.  Not counting the trip(s) overseas, the costs of endless appointments, prescriptions and travel add up quickly.  It has been very humbling to go from a life where we never had to worry about finances, to a place where we have to admit that we can’t do it on our own.  We can only say that your thoughts, prayers, kindness and support have meant everything to us and we’ll do everything that we can to pay it forward when we are able.

The have 6 amazing kids. Hallie-15 Olivia-14 Luke-11 Lincoln-10 Emma-6 and Bo-3. This is no ordinary family. You can find the Smith’s constantly serving others, always having fun but most of all, they are always together. You will not find better kids or more devoted parents. In the fall of 2017, Jodi was diagnosed with stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. After months of difficult chemotherapy treatments and one major surgery, Jodi received a clean bill of health. A true miracle.About a week after her clean scans, Jodi packed up the kids and headed to Utah for a family-filled summer with the kiddos. Casey stayed home to work with plans to meet up with the family at a later date. A few days into the trip, Jodi received a phone call that Casey had collapsed and had two seizures while helping a friend move. Jodi caught a plane in the middle of the night to be by Casey’s side. Casey was diagnosed with Glioblastoma multiforme. An inoperable tumor in the brain. Casey will receive radiation and chemotherapy as treatment as this tumor does not yet have a cure.To know the Smith family is to love them. The Smith kids are incredible examples, faithful as can be and righteous in all they do. Plus, they are fun-loving, hilarious and love each other deeply. To say they’ve had more than their fair share is an understatement but they persevere and continue to choose the right. It is absolutely amazing how these kids have handled the cards that have been dealt to them with both of their parents being diagnosed with cancer. It’s a true testament of good values and a strong family unit.We’ve set up this account to hopefully provide some relief to their family at this time but also because so many people have asked to help. We are truly grateful for all the people who have rallied together and lifted this incredible family up by serving, sending texts, calling, helping with the kids, providing meals, serving others but most of all praying. We’ll continue to pray, pray, pray as we support the Smith’s and Casey.  #smithstrong",276,1.0k,0,267,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He chalked it up to the flu, since it was rampant around town. From the moment he arrived at the ER, his life took a turn that none of us could have ever imagined. Chris didn’t have the flu. Chris was septic. The procedure he had caused a Strep A infection in his blood that traveled throughout his entire body and all of the sudden he was fighting for his life. Chris experienced multiple organ failure, was intubated (on a ventilator), on dialysis and a team of doctors did all they could to save his life. The next few weeks in the Intensive Care Unit proved to be devastating. Chris went thru endless tests with rounds of doctors trying to stabilize his condition. After being intubated for over 2 weeks, doctors chose to perform a tracheotomy so that he could breathe without a tube in his voice box and to reduce the likelihood of infection.Chris had been through the ringer. His body had just barely survived multiple organ and acute heart failure. Then, he couldn’t move his arms or legs. Like many ICU patients who are that close to death, Chris was diagnosed with Critical Illness Neuropathy/Myopathy. This news was beyond anything we were expecting. The Neurologist said that in the 30 years he has been practicing he has never seen such a severe case. He said it may be months or years before Chris will be able to move again, from his neck down. He is not able to breathe on his own, nor able to speak. He is fed through a feeding tube to his stomach.The doctors announced on March 20th that the best course at this time to take would be to transfer Chris to a Long Term Care Facility and out of ICU, where he has now been for the past month. Chris may require professional care for a long time, perhaps the rest of his life.Chris and his wife own a wonderful CPA practice that they acquired after his wife’s step father passed away almost 2 years ago and they were gifted his business. This is their ONLY source of income. They have 2 little girls, ages, 1 ½ and 3 1/2. The financial burden on this family is overwhelming and they will not be able to take on all of the financial responsibilities alone.Our hope and prayer is for Chris to recover and one day regain mobility for independent living. Chris is well known by friends & family for his smile, charm and dedication to wife and children. His family gives heartfelt thanks for the love and kindness they have received to date. Please help support Chris in his time of need! This will help his family with medical expenses and rehabilitation.With love,His Family",294,935,10,299,5 months,12 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

About a month later, Amy began to experience numbness/paralysis on her left side and face.  Amy went through a whirlwind of misdiagnoses and treatments, including MS treatments that led to a severe allergic reaction. Sadly, after biopsy confirmation, she was diagnosed with brain cancer.  In 2013-2014 Amy underwent months of chemotherapy, radiation and then eventually surgery to remove her original brain tumor and miraculously has been cancer free for the past 4 years.  Amy remained paralyzed on her left side from the original tumor but was otherwise able to lead a normal, happy life and mother her children as they have grown.  Sadly, about 9 months ago she started experiencing dizziness and a decline in speech and mobility that has continued to worsen and included a hospital stay in December for pneumonia.  Amy has been unable to speak and walk since August and the burden of care for herself and her four children has been on her family and, in particular, her amazing husband Sean.  We hope to raise funds to help pay for services, medical costs and other unexpected costs.

Flavia Davis, a valued and loved nurse, wife and most importantly mother, has cared for so many adults and children over her extensive career.  Her exemplary work ethics and compassionate care made her instrumental in the initiation of nursing programs in Radiology and at Pediatric MRI and PACU.Then in 2016, Flavia was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  This devastating news wrenched the hearts of all that know her, but Flavia remained resilient. She underwent several surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy, and suffered some severe complications where most would throw their hands up, but not Flavia.  She got on her road to recovery supported by her husband and young son. She was able to return to work doing what she loves and caring for those in need. After a routine checkup later that year, a small spot was discovered in her left lung and thus began another round of chemo.  Three months of treatment and things were looking hopeful. Even when the chemo was leaving her exhausted she pushed through caring for those at work and home. Then devastating news came end of June this year when she went in for her 3 month checkup. The tumor doubled in size and 5 additional tumors were found in her left lung.

As of the date of the creation of this page (08.13.18), it is projected he will remain in the hospital at least 2 more weeks, and he will most certainly require rehabilitation after being released and when he returns to Toronto.As a Canadian citizen, Christopher does not have insurance in the United States as Canadian coverage does not generally cross borders. The costs of his emergency and long-term care are exponentially accumulating with each day that passes, and this is why those who love him have created this page: to let others who also love him, who have been touched by him through his music, his mentorship, or even simply by reading this story, can contribute to his journey of healing by helping to alleviate some of the financial burden that now faces him and his family due to this tragic and life-changing medical crisis.For more information on Christopher, visit our funding website.",352,758,10,354,20 days,2 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Megan recently gave birth to her second child, Julien, a healthy baby boy, but she never really left the hospital. What was initially thought to be a slow recovery from child birth, turned out to be a malignant and aggressive form of cancer. As her friends, you are all aware of Megan’s powerful spirit and unwavering will, and she fought bravely since October, but now she is at rest. We, her family, made her last days as comfortable as possible in her parents home on Sunshine Valley Rd.  She never gave up hope for a miracle, because she refused to leave her children, Jordan (age 5) and Julien (7 months) to this cruel world without their mother. Megan was such an amazing mother; so patient, and fiercely protective. The goal of this campaign is to establish a fund for her two beautiful children, so that they can get an education, have a successful future and afford to live on the coast, and join the community that Megan was a part of. Little Jordan has been so strong throughout this process. She is thriving in school and playing joyfully with her friends. Her potential is limitless, despite this tragedy. Jordan draws strength deep from within, and if we can supplement her education she is going to reach her highest potential. Please keep Megan in your thoughts,  and support one another. Let’s take this opportunity to reaffirm our friendships and become closer as a community. We must celebrate life as we mourn a great soul. Thank you for prayers and donations. Every contribution makes a difference.  We are planning a celebration of Megan's life at Mavericks where her ashes will be spread. Date and time will be announced as the process continues.Much Love, Marcel, Jordan, Julien and The Huber Family.",263,1.0k,3,262,3 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

HERNS is an extremely rare genetic condition, which affects the inner lining of the arteries and blood vessels causing disruption to the major organs. Jordan's family is one of just 15 families that have been diagnosed. You can read more about HERNS here:  https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10534/hereditary-endotheliopathy-retinopathy-nephropathy-and-stroke . The past few years have been very trying for the Ferenc family and in the past 6 months, Jordan’s health has quickly deteriorated.  This disease is causing Jordan’s body to breakdown; he is now legally blind and is being treated for liver disease due to HERNS.  Last week, the family received another setback when he was diagnosed with Hepatopulmonary Syndrome  https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350 , which could cause him to need full time oxygen in the next few months.Sadly, due to the of the rarity of this disease, very little research has been done on HERNS. Therefore, Jordan and Freer spend a great deal of time in doctors' offices and hospitals dealing with each new diagnosis as it occurs and learning alongside the doctors about this disease.The money raised through this GoFundMe will help this family immensely and alleviate some of the financial stress the Ferencs are going through because of this horrible disease. Some of the ways this money will be used:-       Out of network doctor visits and copays-       Uber rides to/from doctor appointments-       Train rides to NYC to meet with specialists-       Handyman to help with home repairs -       Making the house handicap accessible-       Weekly lawn mowing-       Bi-Weekly house cleaning-       Making family memories with Miller – Trips to the zoo, museums or playsAs friends, I know we have all offered to help in any way possible. It is now, that we take our offer and truly help Jordan, Freer and Miller, their 5 year-old daughter. The money raised in this GoFundMe will help the Ferenc family tremendously, no matter what amount you can contribute. We all know how hard it is to ask for help but help is what they need right now. Thank you all!",217,372,2,218,5 months,4 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

She was admitted to St. Anthony's hospital, in St. Pete, Florida,  on June 7, and has spent the days since surrounded by an incredible group of supportive friends and family who continue to be amazing advocates for her care. Michelle's symptoms began just a few weeks ago, but progressed quickly. After consulting with her primary care physician, she underwent a CT scan hoping it would reveal the cause of her abdominal pain and bloating. The CT scan did show some abnormalities, but additional testing was required which took her to St. Anthony's. We received official word that cancer cells were present in her abdomen on June 12, and surgery was performed the same day to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Doctors were pleased with the outcome of the surgery, and to no one's surprise Michelle was an absolute Rockstar from pre-op, through the entirety of the 4-hour surgery, into post-op and recovery. We look forward to getting her back on her feet as soon as possible so she can take the next step in her treatment plan, which will involve chemotherapy. As we begin to digest this news and plan for Michelle's continued care, we have decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf as an outlet for friends near and far to connect and contribute should they feel called to do so.

The following day an echo cardiogram was completed on her heart, which reveled damage to one of the valves showing it was operating at only 20%. This damage was caused by the chemotherapy (known as Cardio Toxicity). The following day during a needle biopsy (Thoracentesis) of the fluid, on March 1st, Julie suffered a stroke.  She was rushed from Spectrum Pennock Hospital in Hastings to Spectrum Butterworth Hospital ER, in Grand Rapids, where we received the sad news that she had suffered severe brain damage in her left brain resulting in right-side paralysis, speech and cognitive issues. Julie spent 16 days in the Critical Care Unit, then transferred to the stroke unit where she spent two additional days, before being transferred to Spectrum Rehab Facility. Julie then began a long, difficult journey of rehab. She has repeatedly revealed her strength and spirit by enduring a ventilator, grueling tests, painful treatments and challenging physical therapy on a daily basis. The past months have been a virtual roller-coaster due to her heart issue, spasticity in her right leg and foot, as well as multiple other complications, setbacks and difficulty finding the proper balance of medications.  Along the way, medical insurance issues have made getting her treatment needs difficult. She has been through approximately 2 weeks of rehabilitation at Spectrum Rehab Facility, then 4 weeks of rehabilitation at Mary Free Bed in Grand Rapids, back home for in-home therapy for a few weeks, then, because of setbacks for various reasons, has been in and out of the hospital, as well as another almost 2 weeks of rehab at Mary Free Bed (not covered by insurance). Chuck has been working tirelessly day and night with God's grace and doing a marvelous job of advocating for her and doing what's best for her; which is what one would want done for themselves if they could not speak the words.  Julie's team of doctors are finding that their options are becoming limited given the condition of her heart and the effects of the stroke.  In the meantime, Julie will be at home trying to get her heart strengthened with medication.  She will need round-the-clock care, as well as daily professional in-home care, which will not be covered by insurance, contributing to the financial strain that has been building over these past months. The costs have been significant and will continue to be.  Those who know Julie know that her big heart has compelled her to always be there for anyone in need and the Lord has blessed so many people through her support and actions.  She has always had a unique ability to know what people need even when they did not know they needed it themselves.  She goes above and beyond to provide whatever is needed.  Be it a helping hand, resources or sometimes just her love and prayers.  At this time of need, here is our opportunity for 'Giving Back to Julie'.  Her family is so grateful for all of the support: thoughts, prayers and expressions of love that she has received.  It is with great faith that we continue on to whatever God has in store. OCTOBER 2014 - BEE BRAVE 5K RUN/WALK",99,453,4,100,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I did not qualify for insurance, nor did I have the financial means to afford private insurance. I had to go to the free clinic, where they referred me to an imaging center. The test results showed a benign cyst. In retrospect, they think the cancer was behind it, not seen on the ultrasound at that time. They told me to come back if it bothered me, otherwise the cyst did not alarm them/seemed normal. In November I started to notice it was larger and actually noticeable through clothing, which bothered me a little. I said I would get it checked out, but holidays happened and life got in the way, and they said it was benign.... Come January 2018 I was snowboarding when I fell and hit my chest pretty hard. Two weeks later it wasn't getting better and seemed swollen, so I went back to the free clinic where they ordered an ultrasound. That came back abnormal. I then had a second ultra sound, blood work, and referral for a mammogram which showed a more serious issue. I then had 4 biopsies, two left breast, 1 lymph node in left armpit and a pretty traumatic one on my right breast. The results are that I have ductal carcinoma in situ. As I waited for the next steps they started doing an MRI, and a petscan, which resulted in showing the cancer has spread to both my lungs and my sternum. Our protocols for women and breast cancer testing is not good enough. It is not  protocol to get a mammogram until 40 years old because programs/insurance won't pay for it without valid reasoning. Mind you because I didn't have insurance, didn't qualify, and am not able to afford private insurance and the clinics are so full and over worked I was forced to wait 5 months to know what was going on. Had regulations and insurance been different I wouldn't be in such a fight right now.""Those are the words of our friend Philecia. Her cancer is stage four and has spread. She is the strongest most vibrant woman we know. We are gearing up to fight this as hard as we can as a team, which is why we need as much help and support from our respective communities as we can get.

Friends who were with him got him to the emergency room at Jefferson General Hospital in Port Townsend quickly. His body, smile, motor functions are improving. The most affected area is his speech center. He is filling in the gaps, is surrendered to his situation, but is operating at about 25% comprehension and memory. He has to rebuild his language, and is getting his ideas across with a lot of help in translation. He will be doing a lot of speech therapy. His uncanny resilience will serve him well.Collin has a great support system in Port Townsend. He has a very close and supportive family as well.While Collin is recovering we can support him emotionally and financially.  He will not be able to work for at least 9-12 months. As we all know, he is a kind soul who in his generosity and brilliance has cared for so many of us. He has been a friend, a coach, an educator, a mentor, a person who we all look up to. With your help we can give him time to heal and get back to work.Please contribute to this fund for him to get by while he recovers. Please be as generous as you can.

Symptoms included debilitating fatigue and body aches, night sweats and insomnia, low blood sugars, nausea and low appetite, tingling, twitching, shooting pains, anxiety and palpitations.In April, after seeing eight doctors and many holistic therapists, she was diagnosed with Lyme Disease. Like many people with Lyme, Kieran was never aware of the tick bite and never had the classic circular rash. Lyme is often missed or misdiagnosed because the symptoms can be vast and can look like many other illnesses. Late-detection can make the disease more difficult to treat and heal. Kieran is now seeing a Lyme-literate nurse practitioner and receiving antibiotic treatment. Her visits, specialized lab tests, and treatment are not covered by insurance. This comes after nine months of illness and distress, which have forced her to give up much of the work she loves — teaching jobs, performances, and more.Kieran and her husband Vincent are both self-employed and an illness like this brings overwhelming financial stress. They have made incredible contributions to our flourishing Boston music/dance/art scene and it is times like THESE when we, as a community, are able to give back and help ease the burden. Funds raised will go directly towards recouping out-of-pocket medical costs and lost income, and for continuing expenses including non-covered doctors’ visits, lab tests, and supportive therapies for Lyme Disease treatment.",395,559,10,406,3 months,2 days ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Dan will have to endure more surgeries to repair all that has been damaged, including an IVC filter in his hip, which will be permanent.  He is one tough cookie and has been pushing everyday to regain movement in his lower extremities.  He has some limited feeling and movement in his left leg above the ankle, below the knee.  He also has some tingling in his  left arm, which could be caused from nerve damage.  Dan has a long road ahead of him and will eventually be transferred to a rehab facility at a later date.  Dan is a tough guy, maybe a bit stubborn, like we all know, but is keeping positive thoughts through what could be the most trying time in his life.  With all of his family and friends continuing  to send up their prayers, we know Daniel will overcome this obstacle.  He has already shown he's a fighter in these first few, trying days.  He has also stated that he WILL be walking by the end of the year!  Now if that isn't determination and positivity, I don't know what is!Ticinie is continuing to give updates daily on Facebook with what is happening and how he is progressing.  Dan's future as of right now is uncertain when it comes to work and his job.  If you are able to donate to this wonderful family to help defray everyday costs and medical bills while the family is supporting Daniel during his recovery, it would be greatly and lovingly appreciated!  We will also be setting up a benefit for Dan and his family at a later date. Thank you and God Bless!",168,972,5,158,7 days,2 hours ago,6 days,2018-09-03

As people come up the Rocky steps and enter the Museum, the first smiling face they see is Angel’s. He’s incurably positive and funny, disarming visitors with his warmth and helpful suggestions — just the person you’d want to encounter when entering a foreboding stone edifice. The Museum places Angel at that key spot because he is so accomplished at what he does, and he is highly valued for it. But Angel’s beaming smile hides just how much trauma he’s enduring inside. It turns out his slim build is supporting a Herculean weight, one he often doesn’t want to talk about. Angel and his wife Jacqueline have a beautiful family that includes their son Angel Luis, 33, and daughter Nitza Jeannet, 30. Angel Luis is married and has an 8-year-old son, Angel Luis Jr. Nitza has a 11-year-old daughter, Mia Lovey, as you can see from their family photos.When Angel met Jacqueline, she was a recent widow. Her husband, ironically also named Angel, had died at the age of 33 from a brain tumor. She had two young children, and Angel enveloped his new family with such love, becoming their strength as they started their lives together. Their kids grew up and started families of their own, just as it’s supposed to be. But a few years ago, Nitza began having internal pains, and she didn’t know what was causing them. Then she had a car accident. In the hospital, they did an MRI scan of her internal organs to make sure nothing was damaged. That’s when they discovered she was full of tumors. The next day they performed emergency surgery on her kidneys, which were being damaged by the growths. Since then she’s had a series of additional operations to remove tumors on the back of her eyes, in her head, all over. She now has a tumor that’s developed on her pancreas. She can’t face having another surgery to remove it, so she’s living with the pain for now.Then Angel Luis, Nitza’s brother, also was in a car accident. Like his sister, scans after the accident revealed that he, too, was as full of tumors. The same sequence followed: emergency kidney surgery, operations to remove brain tumors, and so on. Currently, Angel Luis is undergoing daily radiation therapy for some of his tumors, and he dreads going to the hospital each day for it. His doctors just declared him unable to work for the rest of his life.It turns out Angel Luis and Nitza have a genetic disorder, a rare condition called VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau) disease. The tumors are usually benign, but they can turn cancerous and must be removed before they damage healthy tissue. There is no cure yet for this genetic nightmare that’s passed down from generation to generation.Angel Luis Jr. and Mia Lovey have had CAT scans and MRIs. Sadly, they both carry the gene, but VHL doesn’t typically appear until its victims are in their 20’s or 30’s, just as was the case for Angel Luis and Nitza.Jacqueline has been so distraught by what is happening to her family that she’s having difficulty coping and, for the past few months, has not been able to function at her job. Angel drops his son off at the hospital for his radiation treatment every morning on his way to the Museum, and picks him up afterwards. Angel is the only family member who is able to care for the others, and he’s really worried about keeping his job at the Museum with all the responsibilities he has to his family.And the bills keep mounting. Nitza and Mia Lovey live at home with Angel and Jacqueline. Angel Luis, along with his wife and son, still live in their own place, but it’s questionable how long they can continue to do that. Angel Luis hasn’t been able to work since this started, and now he cannot return to his job. Angel is in crisis. His family needs help; yet, he feels reticent to ask. So, we, his friends, are asking for him. Please help Angel take care of his family. Please donate whatever amount you can to help him pay the bills. We can only imagine how the medical expenses are piling up — let alone the cost of supporting his whole family while trying to keep his job at the Museum. If there ever has been a case worthy of our help, this is it.Angel is truly appropriately named; he is a gentle and kind soul who is trying to manage all of this on his own -- without a complaint.  But it’s time for the rest of us to step up and help with their expenses. Please give what you can – right now – they desperately need your help. Please share Angel’s story with everyone you know, and please ask them to give too.

We then learned that one side of her brain developed abnormally and is larger than the other. This abnormality causes intractable epilepsy along with global developmental delay. Bowen is STRONG, fierce and determined. She proved doctor after doctor wrong and met her milestones time after time. She is one of the smartest 3 year olds we know. That being said Hemimegalencephaly is a life long fight. One we are ready to tackle head on. And our path leads us in a different direction for her now. After failing two seizure medicines and having some discouraging test results, doctors at TCH have determined that surgery is the next step for her. In the next few months, she will have what is called a Hemispherectomy . This is one of the most intense surgeries a little girl could go through. They essentially have to disconnect the right side of her brain from the left. She will be in surgery all day and in the hospital for recovery for at least a month afterwards. She is unlikely to regain skills in her left hand (but again our Bowen loves to prove people wrong). She also will take a cut in her vision field which will require intensive therapy to adjust to this new normal.We know now that life from now on will be ""before surgery'' and ''after surgery.'' Just as her seizure changed our paths so will this.We sat down with her school and teachers to tell them the news of the Hemispherectomy and immediately her teacher said ''tomorrow we start teaching her how to use her right hand more.'' They came up with ideas on how to make her feel comfortable at a hospital, how they can work as a team to help her in any way they can, and most importantly that they are a shoulder to lean on from here on out.That is what this Go Fund Me is about. Every cent will go to the STARS/STARS Scholarship Program at the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center. Bowen will need intensive therapy not only after the surgery but for months and years to come. Every single donation you make will make a difference for not only Bowen but every other child at that school and in this wonderful program. You can see more about STARS here . We had already heard of STARS before she was diagnosed. We immediately fell in love with the program but also decided to tour other special needs schools in the area. We were shocked to find that no one else in Houston has an inclusion program like Bertha Alyce. Preschoolers with disabilities and developmental delays are integrated into a traditional classroom setting where it benefits not only them, but also makes an important impact on their traditional peer groups. What they have here truly is one of a kind and we are extremely lucky.So thank you to each and every one of you who have been there for Bowen and our family. We appreciate you more than you know.

The fact that Morley is only 26 makes his case even more rare as the majority of individuals given this diagnosis are in their 60s and 70s.

On Wednesday, May 2nd, Morley will undergo a 10-15-hour surgery in which doctors will begin to remove as much of the cancer as possible. During the surgery, his spleen, gallbladder, appendix and portions of his small and large intestine will be removed. Following surgery, Morley will undergo roughly 18 weeks of chemotherapy. Given Morley’s current inability to work, this go-fund me was created in an effort to ease the cost of medical bills and other accruing expenses.

Medical,44,All Hands on Deck for Bronwen ,https://www.gofundme.com/allhandsondeckforbronwen,"CAMBRIDGE, MA","April 25, 2018","$50,000","$35,760","Dear Friends, On December 19, 2017, Bronwen Zwicker learned that she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease).  ALS is a disease that affects the nerve cells, or neurons, that control voluntary muscle movement.  Voluntary muscles create movements that include chewing, walking and talking.  The disease disrupts the motor neurons that the brain uses to communicate with the rest of the body, causing them to degenerate and eventually die.  This means that the brain is no longer able to send messages to the muscles.  When the muscles lose function, they become stiff, twitch, weaken, and atrophy. The disease is comprehensive, eventually affecting all voluntary muscles in the body, and inhibiting the affected person's ability to speak, eat, move, and breathe. There is no cure for ALS.  So far, there has been no effective treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease.  Three to five years is the amount of time that the majority of people who are diagnosed with ALS have to live.  There are exceptions, with some living ten or more years from when symptoms first appear. ***So far, you have been reading a general overview of ALS.  There are sentences here that skip light years ahead of Bronwen's current everyday experience.  To place commas between words as heavy with meaning as ""speak,"" ""eat,"" ""move,"" and ""breathe,"" as a way of describing all of the vital actions that ALS effectively ends, feels like an insult, a bludgeoning of the nuances that are packed into the very unique experience of being Bronwen Zwicker.  What I am trying to describe is actually impossible to articulate.  I am trying to describe the indescribable.  Bear with me.  I love her, and this hurts.  ***When she was still a child, Bronwen's voice was already so powerful that she was asked to sing lead in a church play.  The congregants who saw her perform thought that she had been hired as a ringer to sing the part.  If you go to the Zwickers' house today and sit on the back porch as the sun is going down, you can still hear that voice, feel it as it reverberates through your entire body and through the lucky air of Richmond, and understand why those congregants thought that they were listening to a trained professional so many years ago.  But singing for Bronwen is more difficult now.  ALS is already affecting the muscles that are required to make those otherworldly sounds.  Something that has always been second nature to Bronwen--such powerful sounds from such a small person!-- has turned into a physical challenge, and it will continue to grow more challenging.  Every day is packed with profound differences from the day before.  There are not enough words to fit on a website that could adequately describe Bronwen Zwicker herself, nor the many changes she has already experienced in the few months since receiving her diagnosis.  What is of utmost importance is to understand that the range of what is needed to facilitate her new everyday--with the realization that this everyday is always changing as the ALS progresses--means that a substantial amount of funding will be needed for Bronwen to be a person living in the United States with ALS.  Given the costs the Zwicker family has already incurred and the unpredictability of the disease itself, there is no entirely accurate way to pinpoint a dollar amount for funds needed.  Safe to say the amount is high, and it will continue to grow higher.  There may be a lot of uncertainty right now, but one thing that is without a doubt is that Bronwen and her family should not have to go broke as a result of ALS.This is where you can help.   Bronwen and her husband, Stephen Martineau, have moved in with Bronwen's parents, Bob and Dianne Zwicker.  They will need to make modifications to their home so that Bronwen can live as comfortably as possible.  Contractors have estimated that the cost for an accessible bathroom alone will be upwards of $30,000.  The modifications are not covered by health insurance. With assistance from friends and family, Bronwen has begun traveling to Baltimore to participate in weekly clinical trials at Johns Hopkins.  Right now she is paying out-of-pocket for travel and overnight lodging.  These costs will continue to add up as she must participate every three weeks in a trial that lasts a total of twenty-four weeks. These are just some of the changes that have happened in four months.  Beyond hospital bills, home modifications, and the costs of traveling for clinical trials, there are myriad expenses that could pile up, but could potentially be covered if enough funds can be raised, including: - technology to help with communication and other activities - a power wheelchair and accessibility ramps - adaptable clothing and footwear - nursing and personal care- complimentary treatments such as massage and acupuncture So let's get this funding going! Spread the word.  Share and re-share.  Any dollar amount will help. Thank you.",248,818,16,271,4 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Mike rushed home and immediately took Tricia to Otsego Memorial Hospital. Following a CT scan, it was determined that Tricia was suffering a ruptured brain aneurysm and was going to be flown via helicopter to St. Mary’s in Saginaw. Tricia then underwent emergency brain surgery to clamp the brain bleed. This surgery included significant trauma to her skull and brain, of which she will be recovering for an indefinite amount of time. After two weeks in ICU in Saginaw Tricia was released to come home. Despite the joy that step has brought, she remains in a delicate state. One that requires constant around the clock care, numerous medications and expensive co-pays, along with a bumpy road to recovery.Tricia is a self-employed technical writer, whose master of vocabulary, grammar, editing and writing is unparalleled. Yet, today she is having trouble completing a simple text message. She is unable to work and the timetable for her return to writing is completely unknown.Mike has been the voice of Gaylord for more than 21 years, our community’s cheerleader, champion, commentator, and inspirational voice on the Eagle 101.5. He has not been able to work since April 25th, and as Tricia’s sole caregiver his ability to return to work at his regular pace is uncertain. The entire community of Gaylord and surrounding areas have woken daily to his cheerful voice. How many times have we heard Mike help raise money for a local charity, share an inspirational message from a local hero, or have the perfect comment for a tough community moment? Mike is our on-air voice and Tricia is our on-paper gal, and now they are faced with unimaginable bills and medical debt. Coupled with Tricia’s inability to work and significant prescription drug costs weekly, the bills and stressors are mounting.We need to rally to ensure they can remain in our community and in their home. We as a community can work to reduce their financial stresses so that they can focus on Tricia’s recovery and both of their healing from this traumatic event.So, if you know Mike and Tricia Reling, if Tricia ever helped edit your materials, if you have ever heard Mike on the radio, if he ever interviewed you, if you ever laughed at his jokes, if you ever talked baseball with Mike, if you were ever inspired by Mike, his words, or his beams of energy, I humbly ask you to give what you can to support their road to recovery.",316,1.4k,3,309,3 months,23 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

His muscular pain starting to get worse, his body had a difficult time adjusting to dialysis, he suffered from a stroke, and was diagnosed with so many blood clots in his legs he needed surgery.  It was the most painful experience anyone could ever go through and he came very close to losing his left leg from the knee down.  FAST FORWARD TO TODAY.  Gregg needs Oxygen 24/7 to stay alive and the only way to survive or have any type of quality of life is to have a double lung transplant.  None of the Boston hospitals can do the surgery.  UPenn is the only hospital that can do it.  Eventually, he will need to move to Philadelphia because he needs to be within 4 hours of the hospital when he gets the call that they have a set of lungs available for a transplant. Along with the cost of moving to Philly and current medication expenses, the cost of the transplant surgery is 1.6 million dollars.  Most of this is covered by insurance but there will be significant costs he will have to bear.  We are setting up this Go Fund Me Page so friends and family can help raise money to offset some of those significant costs of care for Gregg, and to also to help take care of his family.THANKS FOR READING AND FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, PRAYERS, LOVE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT.",196,482,2,198,1 month,14 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

In addition, he's dealing with respiratory issues that demand constant care. With skyrocketing medical bills, his health insurance has maxed out and he's in desperate need of continuous physical therapy in order to get back on track. Every day Chris keeps getting stronger, but he's got a long recovery road ahead. We are hoping to raise financial support for his medical bills and cover his expenses when he is released from the hospital. So please, give any amount - $1 , $5, $10 or more.

Megan recently gave birth to her second child, Julien, a healthy baby boy, but she never really left the hospital. What was initially thought to be a slow recovery from child birth, turned out to be a malignant and aggressive form of cancer. As her friends, you are all aware of Megan’s powerful spirit and unwavering will, and she fought bravely since October, but now she is at rest. We, her family, made her last days as comfortable as possible in her parents home on Sunshine Valley Rd.  She never gave up hope for a miracle, because she refused to leave her children, Jordan (age 5) and Julien (7 months) to this cruel world without their mother. Megan was such an amazing mother; so patient, and fiercely protective. The goal of this campaign is to establish a fund for her two beautiful children, so that they can get an education, have a successful future and afford to live on the coast, and join the community that Megan was a part of. Little Jordan has been so strong throughout this process. She is thriving in school and playing joyfully with her friends. Her potential is limitless, despite this tragedy. Jordan draws strength deep from within, and if we can supplement her education she is going to reach her highest potential. Please keep Megan in your thoughts,  and support one another. Let’s take this opportunity to reaffirm our friendships and become closer as a community. We must celebrate life as we mourn a great soul. Thank you for prayers and donations. Every contribution makes a difference.  We are planning a celebration of Megan's life at Mavericks where her ashes will be spread.

HERNS is an extremely rare genetic condition, which affects the inner lining of the arteries and blood vessels causing disruption to the major organs. Jordan's family is one of just 15 families that have been diagnosed. You can read more about HERNS here:  https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/10534/hereditary-endotheliopathy-retinopathy-nephropathy-and-stroke . The past few years have been very trying for the Ferenc family and in the past 6 months, Jordan’s health has quickly deteriorated.  This disease is causing Jordan’s body to breakdown; he is now legally blind and is being treated for liver disease due to HERNS.  Last week, the family received another setback when he was diagnosed with Hepatopulmonary Syndrome  https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350 , which could cause him to need full time oxygen in the next few months.Sadly, due to the of the rarity of this disease, very little research has been done on HERNS. Therefore, Jordan and Freer spend a great deal of time in doctors' offices and hospitals dealing with each new diagnosis as it occurs and learning alongside the doctors about this disease.The money raised through this GoFundMe will help this family immensely and alleviate some of the financial stress the Ferencs are going through because of this horrible disease. Some of the ways this money will be used:-       Out of network doctor visits and copays-       Uber rides to/from doctor appointments-       Train rides to NYC to meet with specialists-       Handyman to help with home repairs -       Making the house handicap accessible-       Weekly lawn mowing-       Bi-Weekly house cleaning-       Making family memories with Miller – Trips to the zoo, museums or playsAs friends, I know we have all offered to help in any way possible. It is now, that we take our offer and truly help Jordan, Freer and Miller, their 5 year-old daughter. The money raised in this GoFundMe will help the Ferenc family tremendously, no matter what amount you can contribute. We all know how hard it is to ask for help but help is what they need right now. Thank you all!",217,372,2,218,5 months,4 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

She was admitted to St. Anthony's hospital, in St. Pete, Florida,  on June 7, and has spent the days since surrounded by an incredible group of supportive friends and family who continue to be amazing advocates for her care. Michelle's symptoms began just a few weeks ago, but progressed quickly.

Doctors were pleased with the outcome of the surgery, and to no one's surprise Michelle was an absolute Rockstar from pre-op, through the entirety of the 4-hour surgery, into post-op and recovery. We look forward to getting her back on her feet as soon as possible so she can take the next step in her treatment plan, which will involve chemotherapy. As we begin to digest this news and plan for Michelle's continued care, we have decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf as an outlet for friends near and far to connect and contribute should they feel called to do so.

The following day an echo cardiogram was completed on her heart, which reveled damage to one of the valves showing it was operating at only 20%. This damage was caused by the chemotherapy (known as Cardio Toxicity). The following day during a needle biopsy (Thoracentesis) of the fluid, on March 1st, Julie suffered a stroke.  She was rushed from Spectrum Pennock Hospital in Hastings to Spectrum Butterworth Hospital ER, in Grand Rapids, where we received the sad news that she had suffered severe brain damage in her left brain resulting in right-side paralysis, speech and cognitive issues. Julie spent 16 days in the Critical Care Unit, then transferred to the stroke unit where she spent two additional days, before being transferred to Spectrum Rehab Facility. Julie then began a long, difficult journey of rehab. She has repeatedly revealed her strength and spirit by enduring a ventilator, grueling tests, painful treatments and challenging physical therapy on a daily basis. The past months have been a virtual roller-coaster due to her heart issue, spasticity in her right leg and foot, as well as multiple other complications, setbacks and difficulty finding the proper balance of medications.  Along the way, medical insurance issues have made getting her treatment needs difficult. She has been through approximately 2 weeks of rehabilitation at Spectrum Rehab Facility, then 4 weeks of rehabilitation at Mary Free Bed in Grand Rapids, back home for in-home therapy for a few weeks, then, because of setbacks for various reasons, has been in and out of the hospital, as well as another almost 2 weeks of rehab at Mary Free Bed (not covered by insurance). Chuck has been working tirelessly day and night with God's grace and doing a marvelous job of advocating for her and doing what's best for her; which is what one would want done for themselves if they could not speak the words.  Julie's team of doctors are finding that their options are becoming limited given the condition of her heart and the effects of the stroke.  In the meantime, Julie will be at home trying to get her heart strengthened with medication.  She will need round-the-clock care, as well as daily professional in-home care, which will not be covered by insurance, contributing to the financial strain that has been building over these past months. The costs have been significant and will continue to be.  Those who know Julie know that her big heart has compelled her to always be there for anyone in need and the Lord has blessed so many people through her support and actions.  She has always had a unique ability to know what people need even when they did not know they needed it themselves.  She goes above and beyond to provide whatever is needed.  Be it a helping hand, resources or sometimes just her love and prayers.  At this time of need, here is our opportunity for 'Giving Back to Julie'.  Her family is so grateful for all of the support: thoughts, prayers and expressions of love that she has received.  It is with great faith that we continue on to whatever God has in store. OCTOBER 2014 - BEE BRAVE 5K RUN/WALK",99,453,4,100,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I did not qualify for insurance, nor did I have the financial means to afford private insurance. I had to go to the free clinic, where they referred me to an imaging center. The test results showed a benign cyst. In retrospect, they think the cancer was behind it, not seen on the ultrasound at that time. They told me to come back if it bothered me, otherwise the cyst did not alarm them/seemed normal. In November I started to notice it was larger and actually noticeable through clothing, which bothered me a little. I said I would get it checked out, but holidays happened and life got in the way, and they said it was benign.... Come January 2018 I was snowboarding when I fell and hit my chest pretty hard. Two weeks later it wasn't getting better and seemed swollen, so I went back to the free clinic where they ordered an ultrasound. That came back abnormal. I then had a second ultra sound, blood work, and referral for a mammogram which showed a more serious issue. I then had 4 biopsies, two left breast, 1 lymph node in left armpit and a pretty traumatic one on my right breast. The results are that I have ductal carcinoma in situ. As I waited for the next steps they started doing an MRI, and a petscan, which resulted in showing the cancer has spread to both my lungs and my sternum. Our protocols for women and breast cancer testing is not good enough. It is not  protocol to get a mammogram until 40 years old because programs/insurance won't pay for it without valid reasoning. Mind you because I didn't have insurance, didn't qualify, and am not able to afford private insurance and the clinics are so full and over worked I was forced to wait 5 months to know what was going on. Had regulations and insurance been different I wouldn't be in such a fight right now.""Those are the words of our friend Philecia. Her cancer is stage four and has spread. She is the strongest most vibrant woman we know. We are gearing up to fight this as hard as we can as a team, which is why we need as much help and support from our respective communities as we can get.

The Hannoun family departs from France to South Florida to start a new life in the United States. Even though it meant leaving the remainder of the family behind, the two young children, David and Robin, are so excited to get to a life of sunshine and rainbows (literally) and get away from all of the negative stigma that France held for them. “We’re never going back,” Robin said to David as they both saw the Independence Day fireworks streaming through the sky, something they’d never even thought about in their young days in France. Well, funny how life turns out sometimes.Fast forward to June 2018. Robin, now 21 years old, has just returned from a trip to Asia and is starting his first professional internship at an investment firm in Tampa, FL. He has a bit of a headache and is feeling nauseous, but he just shrugs it off as nerves or bad Chipotle or something like that. A week goes by, still the same feeling of nausea. He starts to seek medical attention, going to see a few different medical professionals in the South Florida area. No one is able to tell him what’s wrong with him.Rightfully worried and concerned, he decided to take matters into his own hands. Despite how the two brothers felt about France, there is one thing that is undoubtedly true – the healthcare system is miles ahead of that of the United States. So, Robin got on a flight to France, not even booking a return flight because he knew something was wrong. This was Friday, June 29th. He landed in Paris at 1:00 PM. By 3:00 PM, he found out he had a benign tumor in the left ventricle region of his brain. With his grandfather a highly regarded doctor throughout France, he was able to get in the care of Professor Parker, one of the world’s leading practitioners in neurosurgery. Robin met with him that Saturday; within a few minutes, he was scheduled for intensive brain surgery for that Tuesday, July 3rd.Everyone’s life changed. His mother, who was with his sister in New York for a dance competition, booked a flight to France immediately. His brother, who lives and works in Atlanta, did the same. His father was already in France, but now, there were no plans of returning to the States. Everyone was there for Robin when he got out of surgery, and we were all so impressed and pleased by the man we saw.Literal moments after getting out from brain surgery, when it normally takes weeks or even months to be able to move, Robin was stretching his arms and rotating his legs back and forth. He was conversing with us, he was completely conscious, and he was kicking his recovery’s ass. In fact, he was able to walk by himself within 2 days, something which usually takes several months for patients with a similar surgery. We were all so happy and pleased with how everything was going, and quite honestly, so was he.And then came the next piece of the story. Robin’s benign tumor had been sent to the lab for biological analysis just as standard procedure, and as it turns out, it actually wasn’t benign at all; in fact, it was quite the opposite. What Robin had gotten removed was a malignant medulloblastoma, a cancerous tumor which turns out had metastasized into  another region of his brain. Long story short, he had brain cancer, and needed to get treatment right away.Robin was then sat down and told the plan, the plan that would ultimately determine the most basic thing – his survival. Regular sessions of chemotherapy followed by regular sessions of radiotherapy. He would perform all of these in France over the coming months.Now, the hardest part for most cancer patients isn’t the physical symptoms and reaction to the therapy; the hardest part, by far, is the mental part. Staying positive amongst all of these negatives, keeping faith in the process even when your platelets get so low that you have to get a transfusion that doesn’t even work because you’re so depleted that your vein literally bursts when plucked with a needle, or being able to tell yourself that you’re going to get through this even when there is no indication or certainty at all. This isn’t like a common cold, or breaking a bone, or twisting an ankle. This is cancer, and nothing is certain.So how does this apply to Robin? Well, he has always been a fighter; when it comes to the physical symptoms, he’s reacting very well and he himself is not worried about them. The mental part is a different story. Remember how when he and his brother were little kids, he told David “We’re never going back.” Well, he meant it. He never wanted to go back and spend extended amounts of time in France, much less live there while getting treated for arguably the worst type of cancer known to man. So, it’s needless to say that not only is the treatment tough, but he is incurably homesick, misses his friends, his habits, his familiarity of living in the US. And while we can’t literally bring the US to him, one thing we can do is bring the next best thing – his friends.Robin has a crew, a group of several young men who all call each other best friends, and they all would be willing to do anything for one another. The goal of this fundraiser is to pay for biweekly trips to France for Robin’s best friends to come see him, to establish some sort of resemblance of home and bring some happiness and familiarity back into his life as he goes through and fights this horrible disease. As they say, even the smallest of lights shines bright if it’s in the darkest of places. Help us save Robin. Help us save my brother.David Hannoun",319,761,5,335,24 days,4 hours ago,20 days,2018-09-03

The separation then causes blistering. Blisters can occur with even the slightest bit of friction to Danni Jo's skin. Danni Jo is still healing from blistering sustained during the birthing process and continues to develop new blisters daily despite the amazing 24 hour care she’s receiving from doctors, nurses, Austin, and Chris in the NICU. To combat blistering and infection, Chris and Austin must keep Danni Jo covered in Aquaphor  and work as a team to bandage her entire body from the neck down at least once a day to help protect her skin. Danni Jo is tough as nails just like both of her parents and she’s eating well and getting stronger everyday. This will be a long journey ahead for  Christopher, Austin, and Danni Jo as EB is a lifelong condition. Medical costs for people with EB can be astronomical at up to $10,000 per month for special equipment and medical supplies alone, plus doctor visits, special clothing and bedding, and more. Most insurance  companies have a cap on the amount covered for medical equipment specifically and only Chris will be able to work due to the constant care that Danni Jo will require. We are asking anyone who has it in their heart to help donate to this beautiful new family, and help our little Danni Jo on her journey ahead. Austin and Chris are both military veterans with Austin serving in the Air Force and Chris in the Army stationed with the 173rd in Bamberg Germany and Logar province Afghanistan from 2009-2012.

It’s her way of life in its simplest form. Enjoy every moment as tomorrow is not promised.  Loved fiercely by so many, she personifies what it means to live life to the fullest. Some of the hallmarks of being Aida are her sunny but caring personality, quick wit, and no filter responses to life's unpredictability. From New York City, to Arizona, to Florida she has amassed a circle of friends and loved ones who would do anything and everything for her. She is everyone's biggest cheerleader. If you ask anyone of her friends they will tell you ""She is my best friend.” She makes everyone feel as if they are the most special person in her life. That is the essence of who she is. June 2016,  held the promise of  a wonderful summer to look forward to with warm sunny days, beach plans, catching up with friends and family. Little did she know it would be the beginning of a journey that was unimaginable.  After months of enduring pain that would not dissipate she finally decided to go to the doctor to determine the cause.  Like millions of women across the world, she’s diagnosed with breast cancer – Stage 3 later developing into Stage 4. After months of chemotherapy, radiation and a double mastectomy seven months later, she seemed fine. Unfortunately Aida's cancer continued to progress. The most recent diagnosis as of Saturday, Monday, May 19th is that the cancer has progressed to a brain condition called Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LC). It is a rare complication of cancer which spreads to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. LC occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is terminal. This causes blurred vision, strenuous headaches, causes the body to clamp up with no mobility, unable to speak clearly (slurring of words) where she cannot be understood and increased pressure in the brain. These episodes are increasing day-by-day. The doctors determined that a shunt surgery would stabilize the pressure that is in her brain. Monday, May 20th she will undergo this procedure. Our Princess Warrior’s hope and faith for a cure and longer life have never wavered.  She hasn’t stopped laughing and enjoying her time with family and friends. Her will to live has never diminished. God is wonderful and has blessed her with the greatest group of supporters!The doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are in search of different types of treatment to extend her life. The treatments are costly, one that will require the help of all of us coming together to relieve strenuous and costly medical bills . The situation is urgent!  We have created this Go Fund Me in hopes that collectively, all of Aida's loved ones can raise the money to pay for treatment. These funds will be a tremendous help as she explores all avenues that can lead to a potential life-saving treatment. We appreciate you taking the time to read this appeal and considering a donation to this urgent cause.

As a brain cancer survivor for the past two years, she continues to show a poise and elegance while enduring the latest treatments provided by Memorial Sloan Kettering to battle this disease. At the onset of it all, Pam decided to become an active participant and survivor by joining the newly formed NJ chapter of the National Brain Tumor Society. The Molloy's Marchers have been the #1 fundraising team for the non-profit organization for the past 2 years.  Pam was raised in Glendora California by Pat and Gil Riley along with her sister Sherri.

She left the work force and stayed home to raise her family.

Medical,51,Mac's Battle With Ewing's Sarcoma,https://www.gofundme.com/macchilders,"PORTLAND, OR","March 28, 2018","$35,000","$33,248","On Valentine’s Day, our world came to a halt when Mac was diagnosed with a rare childhood cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma. What had been a nagging pain in his leg turned out to be the last thing any parent wants to hear: that their child has cancer. No one wants to think that this can happen, let alone to a child that we love — our smart, funny, interesting, and creative twelve year-old Mac.        Mac has been under the care of doctors at Doernbecher's Children's Hospital at OHSU in Portland. After the diagnosis, he quickly began chemotherapy and just finished his second round. It is an excruciating schedule: he is inpatient for all his chemo which is every other week, anywhere from 2-5 days.  All totaled, he spends about half the month in the hospital.  Mac has to endure 7 rounds of chemo and then will undergo an extensive surgery in May to remove the tumor and rebuild his leg.   After surgery, Mac will be non weight-bearing for at least three months! He will be in a wheelchair and eventually on crutches if possible. He will require constant care. He only gets  a couple weeks reprieve and then begins several more months of chemotherapy after surgery.      All in all, Mac is facing nearly a year of treatment, hopefully getting his last round of chemo before Christmas. Mac’s prognosis is good, and we are all counting on a clean bill of health and a joyous return to normal life once this process is over.  However, it is a daunting year ahead. It will be filled with much worry, suffering, and demanding care — and also with strength, wisdom, love, and support. Our family has felt the love pour in from so many, and now we are asking for your support.   It is difficult to ask for help, but the year ahead will have many trials, including financial. Mac’s chemo schedule requires Laura and Kelby to join him in the hospital (there is no place they would rather be) and then at least one of them must be home to help when he’s sick. Kelby continues to work when Mac is not in the hospital, and his fire department has been unbelievably supportive with offers to cover his shifts and be flexible with his needs.    As many of you know, Laura has her own private practice and so when she doesn't work she doesn't get paid. Her schedule has already been vastly reduced, seeing clients when she can.  They have insurance, but many things are not fully covered.  Here is an idea of some things they have immediate needs for:   *  Wheelchair ramp for Mac * Bathroom remodel to accommodate wheelchair and non-weight bearing status * Laptop for Mac to video conference with his class to keep up with his schoolwork * Knee scooter, wrist crutches and other devices not covered by insurance * Supplementing Laura's loss of income for a year            This all comes at a great cost, and that is why we are asking for your support. Mac is doing the hardest work of all, and the greatest gift is enabling Laura and Kelby to have the ability to care for him during this unimaginably difficult year. By easing some of the financial stress, you would be directly helping Laura and Kelby devote all their resources to caring for Mac and helping insure that he has the best support possible for the fight ahead.        Here are some words about Mac from a dear family friend:   Mac is an incredible friend to so many. He has grown up as a Candalaria Husky and is now an exemplary student at Howard Street Charter Middle School in Salem. Mac delights in the ordinary, and extraordinary experiences that life has to offer. He is zealous about being a keeper of tradition, finding meaning and belonging in annual trips to the Polar Express with family and friends and annual Easter hunts in the back yard with neighbors. He can transform a trampoline or a dining room table into a fortress of fun and innovation. He is an encyclopedia about all things Lego, Marvel, Magic and Star Wars. He loves to create movies and animations of his own that express his interests, talents and showcase his great sense of humor. Mac has an abiding love for dogs, especially his 3 labs, Brick, Lego and Leia. It is not uncommon to find him piled up in a snuggly blanket with one or more of his canine companions. Mac finds points of connection with anyone who lends him an ear. Whether you are an adult or one of Mac's peers, you can't help but admire the way he creates an environment of inclusion wherever he goes. Mac can move from serious to silly seamlessly and has the ability to ignite contagious laughter. He is kind, brilliant, innovative, all without losing his empathic spirit. Mac knows what it is to truly walk alongside others, and often is a place of refuge for those who feel outcast. Now it is our turn to walk with Mac. For such a rare and unique individual to have such a rare form of cancer, we are afforded a rare and unique opportunity to journey alongside Mac and impart our strength to carry him through the next year of treatment.",170,493,15,184,5 months,23 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He also has sensory deprivation mid-chest down that makes him unable to distinguish between dull and sharp touch; as well as, temperature variations.Anyone who has met our dad knows what a determined and optimistic person he is. Through all of life’s uncertainty, he has maintained a positive outlook and helped others in any way possible. Although the doctor’s prognosis from his SCI is uncertain and we are still awaiting a diagnosis, he has not accepted this as his personal reality and is exemplifying the strength of his spirit by challenging himself everyday. Through this trial he has been motivated and eager to put in the hard work necessary to regain the ability to walk, something many of us take for granted, so that he too can experience the little joys life has to offer, like back packing with his children, river rafting, and dancing with his daughter at her wedding.The road to walking again will be intense, but our dad is prepared to do everything in his power to get there! Although we are currently looking at a two-year (at best) time frame for his recovery, it is crucial to have continuous physical therapy throughout this journey and to ensure that his medical needs are met.Donations will go towards medical and physical needs, such as: durable medical equipment, wheelchair costs, medications to alleviate his constant pain and muscle spasms, and various physical therapies including PT, acupuncture, swimming, cycling and massage. The most important aspect for his progress will be his acute rehab at SCIFIT, an extremely rigorous, holistic physical therapy regimen specifically customized for each individual SCI patient’s particular needs for the fullest recovery possible.Below are links to some of the organizations that have helped to inform, educate, connect and inspire our father.We would like to share these resources for people in Northern California also affected by a SCI.NOR CAL SCI: https:  https://norcalsci.org/NO LIMITS COLLABORATIVE:  http://www.nolimitscollaborative.org/BORP:  http://www.borp.org/get-involved/SCIFIT:  http://sci-fit.org We appreciate all the love, support and positive vibes we’ve received and are so thankful for your donations.  We would also like thank all the Occupational and Physical Therapists; as well as, the doctors and nurses who have and continue to help our dad.Please share, so our dad’s story can reach as many people as possible and hopefully help a few people on the way! Klaes, Jack, and Gwen   ** Spinal strokes are very rare and account for less than two percent of all stroke. A very special thanks to Teresa Montgomery whose love is like a mighty river.

Due to the freak blizzard conditions the Boston area was experiencing, a snow layer prevented the fall from being fatal, but nevertheless Ryan was rushed to the hospital with a substantial list of injuries. Ryan suffered a skull fracture (above the ear) causing his brain to bleed in 3 separate places, 3 broken ribs, a collapsed lung, fractured right hip, and lacerated kidney and liver. A 2nd year Environmental Science major at Boston University, Ryan is a passionate, energetic, and hardworking individual. Described by many as “the life of the party,” Ryan truly embodies the Aloha Spirit. The type of upbeat character most people wish they’d meet earlier. Growing up in Honolulu, he embraced the local culture of community, where surfing, hiking, paddling, and weekends selling pineapples at the KCC Farmers Market kept him busy. There, and everywhere he ventured his infectious laugh, smile and goofy personality charmed everyone he encountered.In order to minimize the stress and anxiety on his family during such turbulent times, we ask for everyone's help to donate any amount to assist Ryan. Donations will go directly towards the extensive medical bills for his current and future procedures/tests, which already include multiple CAT scans, chest x-rays, and ICU costs. The second main hurdle that funds will cover are the rehabilitation costs, which doctors estimated could last up to a few months. While all this happens, Ryan’s single mother plans to remain by his bedside in Boston as long as she can, taking time off from her full-time job.  Ryan is a loved son, brother, cousin, nephew, and friend to to us all. We ask that you PLEASE share this page with anyone and everyone you know on any platform that you see fit. More importantly please send positive energy and prayers for the strength and recovery of Ryan Hwang. - Mahalo!",588,1.0k,14,570,5 months,5 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

Medical,52,A Fresh Start for Bill ... HALT MS,https://www.gofundme.com/BillSparrow,"SCOTTDALE, PA","April 16, 2018","$60,000","$60,725","A Fresh Start for Bill ... HALT MSIntro:  HSCT Help & Your HelpAfter countless months of pressure, this extremely humble person finally let me put up this GoFundMe site. The reason why I’m reaching out to you is because he needs our help. Currently, there is NO cure for Multiple Sclerosis but there could be a way to HALT the progression and possibly repair the damage with a procedure called HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant). Sharing his MS disease has been a very difficult thing for Bill. He’s NEVER wanted to discuss this debilitating disease to anyone but there’s now … some real HOPE. Diagnosis and What IS MS?Bill was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1994, his form of MS is called Relapsing-Remitting. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system and is an unpredictable condition that can be relatively benign or entirely disabling. There is NO cure for MS, it damages the nerves in the spinal cord and brain, this causes the exacerbations that lead to difficulties in walking, vision, cognitive problems and other physical difficulties.  More about MS: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/home/ovc-20131882 Today and Future:For the last 23 years, this disease has worsened for him. He has explained to me the exhaustive treatment options over his lifetime having MS; he’s been on countless FDA approved disease modifying drugs and advised by numerous MS Doctors, all while most of these Specialists and the MS Society have said,  “ There will be a cure SOON… just wait.” He’s been on extensive Paleo diets, physical fitness regimes, alternative vitamins, alternative therapies and alternative procedures … he is NOT getting better. Life is more difficult every year and it’s also more difficult for his family. The 20+ years of cumulative damage are now greatly affecting his ability to walk, balance, run a business, process thoughts, and just live life...let alone enjoy life. MS limits ALL of his life! He finds it difficult to imagine where he’ll be in 5, 10 and 20 years. He doesn’t want to deteriorate more but it WILL happen if the underlying disease is not stopped. MS is a persistent and relentless disease. Finding HSCT/Stem Cell Therapy: After years of researching, Bill found a procedure called HSCT. Finally something concrete…HSCT HALTS the disease for a significant number of people and it has been proven in FDA medical trials and international journals for over 15 years. In Scandinavia where MS is very prolific, as a part of their national medical care, HSCT is their standard protocol. Here are some studies looking at the efficacy of HSCT.  Click here  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22127896/  and a second study  https://bit.ly/2IV0iTC .Unfortunately, HSCT treatment in the US, Australia and other countries are in medical trials. Unlike standard US medical trials, these trials are almost always paid for by the patient, anywhere from $200-$500K for the treatment, on top of that there is a strict criteria to even get into the study.What is HSCT?HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant) is an established chemotherapy treatment demonstrated to be effective for halting disease progression in autoimmune diseases such as MS. It should not be confused with Regenerative embryonic or Fat derived stem cell therapy, which have yet to prove their long-term effectiveness for MS. HSCT “reboots” the immune system back to a point before the patient ever developed the ""markers"" for MS. The patient's body can then, over a period of months/years begin to repair/improve itself. Some of the awful symptoms that have the potential to improve are: balance, fatigue, heat sensivity, cognitive function, and the ability to just simply walk. Although HSCT procedure is NOT FDA approved in the US, it has been done for more than 10 years in clinical trials at Northwestern Hospital in Chicago and many other hospitals around the country. These trials have shown a 90% disease stoppage success rate. These ongoing clinical trials in the US are only for qualifying patients. In countries like Canada, Mexico, Russia, Germany and Israel to name a few, the qualification for patients is broader and although the success rates aren't at the 90% level, they do far exceed the rates of current treatments used in the US.Every legitimate medical treatment available today was at one time previously not FDA approved. However, HSCT itself IS an FDA approved medical treatment for cancer and has been performed millions of times since 1967. It simply isn't currently FDA approved for the indication of an autoimmune disease, but it WILL be eventually. It just takes time for the slow-moving wheels of medicine + Government bureaucracy to complete this approval process but make no mistake about it. . . . just because HSCT is not approved on paper for autoimmune diseases does not mean that it doesn't work. The data are crystal clear today; HSCT is the most effective legitimate medical intervention so far discovered to completely and durably HALT autoimmune diseases like MS. It is not necessary for treatment to be ""approved"" to show this….. www.healthline.com/health-news/ms-patients-who-received-stem-cell-transplants-still-in-remission-010715%2523modal-close or this 60 Minutes newscast ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0hekaFdmD0&feature=youtu.be.If you only watch one video/click any hot spot on this site, please go to this site below. This is a newscast from the BBC just published on March 19th, 2018; it IS proof of ALL the studies for over a decade … HSCT does HALT Multiple Sclerosis.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFyByMiwNNg&feature=youtu.be .Why Treatment at Clínica Ruiz in Mexico:Other countries have clinics currently treating MS with HSCT, since Bill was not accepted at the Northwestern Chicago study (Northwestern has a very narrow acceptance criteria) and because the cost there is approximately $200K, he has applied and was just approved to be treated at Clínica Ruiz in Mexico this summer. Clínica Ruiz is the largest patient volume autoimmune disease HSCT treatment center in the world. Dr. Ruiz Argüelles and Dr. Gómez-Almaguer have performed more than 2500 HSCT procedures during more than 20 years, out of which over 700 have been for MS. Their transplant related mortality is 0.22%, among the safest treatment records in the world. Positive results have been achieved in over 78% of the patients transplanted at Clínica Ruiz.Dr. Guillermo José Ruiz, namesake of this clinic, studied Internal Medicine and Hematology in Mexico and proceeded on to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN for his Post-doctoral research and training. As a result of the academic activity stemming from this program, he was elected Mayo Clinic’s distinguished Alumnus and elected Master of the American College of Physicians in 2013. More Information go to Clínica Ruiz’s site:  http://www.hsctmexico.com The Procedure/Recovery & Cost of Treatment :The procedure is intense; 4-6 weeks in the hospital, where T-cells (stem cells) will be harvested from his own bone marrow. He will then undergo a chemotherapy procedure to wipe out the immune system and the memory of MS. After a period of isolation, those T-cells will be reintroduced into the body. The new cells will migrate back to the bone marrow and eventually establish a new immune system that is less likely to attack the central nervous system, therefore HALTING the progression of MS; essentially its like a “FRESH START!”Here is where Bill NEEDS OUR HELP.  Unfortunately, nothing is covered by insurance. The procedure will cost $60,000, these funds would cover the cost of the treatment, travel to Mexico and a 24/7 trained out-patient staff during his time in Mexico. Bill will be there for approximately 4-6 weeks depending on various stages of the protocol and on his immune systems recovery. He will update the GoFundMe site regularly  with his progress. Appreciation:That big hearted person is still there but this disease has taken away:   The Rock Climber,  The Kayaker, The Explorer and most importantly … A Part of that Person whose Treasured things in LIFE are his FAMILY and FRIENDS.With HSCT there is finally some HOPE. The sooner HSCT is performed, the sooner this progression STOPS!~ Walking is man’s best medicine. HippocratesYOU CAN HELP BILL …1.  GIVE whatever you can.

After months of countless doctor appointments, frustration and confusion about why her leg wasn’t working properly, she was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, well known for as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease.  In a very short 6-month period, Beth went from a healthy hard working math teacher, to a strong and hopeful woman fighting a serious disease. ALS is a disease of the parts of the nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. In ALS, motor neurons (nerve cells that control muscle cells) are gradually lost. As these motor neurons are lost, the muscles they control become weak and then nonfunctional. A number of strategies and approaches are being tested around the world, both in the laboratory and in human clinical trials. One of the most significant breakthroughs in the last decade has been the discovery of a number of genes that, when flawed, cause ALS.  In late 2017, Beth took an awful fall while playing her beloved sport of tennis (yes this super woman managed to play tennis every Wednesday with her girlfriends). She was badly bruised and decided to take a little break from the sport as she healed. Not too much later she started experiencing fatigue, lack of mobility and twinges in her feet. Walking short distances had become slightly difficult for her and Beth was starting to get concerned.  After going to the orthopedist and having numerous x-rays taken, she was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis.  Beth began physical therapy but there was no improvement and was getting worse. She continued with this diagnosis and saw a specialist in Manhattan who had much acclaim with treating patients who had spinal stenosis.  She received a cortisone injection, however, again, there were no improvements. Beth's fears heightened, but being such a strong, prideful woman she hardly complained.  She expressed that she had an awful feeling that she may have MS but tried not to think along those lines.Winter recess was now around the corner and her walking difficulties became more pronounced.  Less than a half a block walk was extremely hard for her and this vivacious woman was having a tough time. It seemed to all be happening so fast.Fast forwarding slightly, Beth was now seeing neurologists and other doctors to see if an alternate diagnosis could be found.  Beth was then diagnosed with ALS.  This disease has moved quickly and she is now in rehab.  Her beautiful and strong family have one goal in mind and that is to get her overseas for a special treatment that has been showing hope for this dreadful disease. Beth is the sweetest, kind-hearted and most hard working mother, friend and women anyone could ask for. She has dedicated her early years to the garment industry and 20+ years to devoting her days to teaching hundreds of kids in Brooklyn, the complicated world of mathematics. Her students, parents and colleagues adore her and has always brought nothing short of smiles, positivity and friendship to her work environment. Beyond her work life, she is a magnificent wife, mother and friend. She has three beautiful children and a loving husband, Ron fighting through each day with her. Her caring, nurturing and loving personality has created a strong foundation for her family and a warm environment for success. But now, Beth needs our help. In addition to the prayers and well wishes, Beth needs financial support to assistant with significant medical expenses, including adaptive living devices, rehab, home care and medical treatments. As you can see, this is a tragic situation. Your funds will directly support Beth’s treatment, alleviate the financial burden of Beth being unable to work, and to assist with the ongoing medical costs that are yet to come. Please share this page to everyone – all the support helps!

I’m the oldest child(21) of John and Jennifer Dedmon. I started this GoFundMe with a heavy heart because my mother and father were sadly involved in an ATV accident over the Father’s Day Weekend and were admitted to the ICU in Utah Valley Hospital.John and Jen and the entire family from Las Vegas were celebrating this Father’s Day Weekend at Yuba Lake State Park. On Saturday, June 16, John and Jen went out on an ATV ride. While out on the ATV there was an accident and they were thrown from the ATV and sustained serious injuries. Shortly after they were rushed to the closest hospital via helicopter.My Mother, Jen, was admitted into the hospital with a broken ulna and radius in her left forearm, a fractured rib, a fractured pelvis, a few fractured vertebrae’s of the lower spine, and lacerations/road rash all over her body.My father, John, was admitted into the hospital with a severe head injury. He has multiple facial fractures around his left orbital and is currently in a coma. The doctors are not sure when he will wake up. Doctors ran tests and have found his brain activity is almost completely normal with the acception that they have identified the bleeding in his brain to be a very minor Subarachnoid Hemorrage(SAH), so they are sort of perplexed to why he hasn’t woken up yet... The road to recovery for this type of injury is a long and winding road, so John will need all the loving support of his friends and family to help him through this tough time.John and Jennifer are two loving souls, two warriors of light, who always do their best to create a better world, a better environment for themselves and everyone around them. They find their happiness in helping those around them find their happiness. Besides me, John and Jen also have an 18yr old son, 12yr old son, and 10yr old daughter whom they love unconditionally and support financially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Unfortunately, my father is the family’s main source of income while my mother is a stay at home mom which causes a little hiccup in handling the finances due to the intensive care that both my mom and dad need, the surgeries, cat scans and MRI’s, air transportation to the hospital, and regrettably not having any health insurance. Any and all donations will be going towards our family to help with medical bills and any financial hardships due to my father not being able to work. Any amount helps. If you cannot donate, we still love you. My family and I just ask you pray for John and Jen and send them as much positive, healing energy as you can.Thank you and Namaste <3￼￼",231,1.9k,23,222,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

He has been fighting with his insurance company to have them cover the treatment, literally since his  diagnosis and often in the middle of treatment.It's next to impossible for him to make any kind of a living.  As his friend I can't sit here and watch the man suffer, so I've put together this little go fund me to ask for help for Dan.  Anything would be of help, as little as $5 and much as... well you know cancer treatment charges, they're astronomical.  Then there's rent (he could be evicted soon)  food, transport, medical, it all adds up.  And it's all needed as soon as ossible.  .  I have set a goal of $30,000, although I'm sure the bills will far exceed that.The type of cancer Dan has is called “Double Hit” Lymphoma, which is a very rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma – which is already super aggressive. He is at Cedars Sinai because that is one of the few places in the world that has the required expertise on the double hit lymphoma . So if you could all do me a huge favor and help my friend Dan, I would be most grateful, and I know he would be too.Cancer can strike at any time and at any age, having friends who can help in an emergency is a wonderful thing.

The best family on earth I am sure of it - seriously they are amazing and I am SO LUCKY to call them MY family through marrying Bekah's mom's (Lisa) brother Dan. Bekah was not found until 5:30am, approximately 3 hours after hitting the power line and rolling around, managing to get herself off the hood of the car and out of the glass, where she then rolled around screaming in the grass and mud until someone found her on their morning run at 5am.  She quickly spun off the road and hit a power line pole head on.  She was ejected from the car (thank goodness because I don't think she'd be with us had she remained in the car because it is absolutely crushed).  God was with her for sure and she fought through because of her love for her family.  Some of the siblings went to the site of the accident and there was no blood.  Her lacertations were down to the bone and through muscle, but no blood at the scene, even though she was covered when she arrived at the hospital.  I told Lisa yesterday, if anyone doesn't believe in God, just tell them this story.Her hair was found on the pole. Her injuries are agonizingly tragic and include a fracture neck vertebrae, lacerations on her liver, lacerations on her leg in two places (almost to the bone) - all the way around her knee and a huge gash they couldn't even close during surgery yesterday right near that main artery in your leg, 5 broken ribs, a broken scapula, two strokes!!! (omgosh), and torn nerves and ligaments in her hand affecting the mobility of her two middle fingers at this point. Her arm was also completely severed and will need skin grafts and more surgeries.  All of her teeth were chipped and dental work will be expensive in the coming months once she's through the more life threatening tragedy.I know I am writing very candidly, and I don't mean to upset her friends, family, relatives or community.  But for everyone who shares this, it reaches many more people and I want them to understand the gravity of the accident.I am setting up this GoFundMe account because the family really really needs all the financial support they can get.  Bekah's dad just finished paying off the bills from his heart surgery two years ago and they support 7 children!!!, including a 2 year old who they fostered and then adopted.  Adoption runs through our family.  My goal is to raise $40,000 to cover her approximate medical costs (they have a very high out of pocket maximum because they have so many kids and do not work for large corporations).  We also need to raise money to pay for her rent while she moves back in with her parents for a while, the dental work which won't be covered and the list goes on, including her parents being out of work to take care of her, her car, etc.).The whole family really needs all the prayers and support they can get as they adjust their lives for a few months.  Bekah doesn't even realize at this point what all has happened  They are the most lovely family and I cherish them. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE find it in your HEARTS to help them financially and through prayer.  Remember, we are a VILLAGE and it sometimes takes a village to get through something as tragic as this.  Hug your loved ones and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help us raise this money so they don’t have to worry about how to manage and stress over all that and can focus on getting Bekah well and back to a new normal!!  If you aren't able to donate, please PRAY and SHARE this with your network!!!!  And tag anybody and everybody who knows Bekah and her family!I promise you, this money will go toward a wonderful family, who is near and dear to me, and many others who will share this on their facebook walls.  And TRUST me, the money is truly going to what they need.  They have tons of family and community support but we can't do this without raising money.  Karma and God will pay you back, ten fold.",392,2.3k,4,380,6 days,3 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Within one week it had aggressively grown which blocked her bowels. She had emergency surgery on April 22nd to remove the tumors only to find that the cancer had spread throughout her abdomen and bowels. Doctors did not remove all of the tumors during the first surgery because that would have required the complete removal of her bowel system and delayed the option of chemo.After a week of recuperating at Kaiser, she was sent home, but is unfortunately unable to eat any solid food. For the next 6 weeks she will receive her nutrition via an I.V. line called a T.P.N. In addition, Dana is also undergoing chemotherapy and will require another surgery in the near future.

He lives with his dad, Jason (an Airman and part of the Special Forces community at Fort Bragg), in Pinehurst, NC during the school year and spends time with his mom, Beth, and his brothers, Alec and Braxton, in Ohio during the summer. He loves to cook (he wants to become a chef!), hang out with friends, play video games, scuba dive, and get into trouble at his grandma's farm.This summer Brett was supposed to be preparing for his first year of high school. He was going to take drivers education, go camping, and take a trip to Florida with his dad and brothers. Instead, Brett has spent weeks in the hospital having numerous surgeries after being diagnosed with brain cancer - specifically, a Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). How it StartedBrett began having headaches this spring. His dad, Jason, took him to their doctor in North Carolina. The doctor thought the pain was from allergies and suggested an over the counter allergy medication.On June 4th2018, allergy medications in hand, Brett traveled to Ohio to spend time with his mom and brothers. Later that week, Brett began to struggle with nausea and his mother took him to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed him with an ear infection and Brett was given antibiotics as well as new allergy medication.A week later, Brett's mom took him and his brothers on a camping trip to Pennsylvania. During the trip Brett once again became nauseous. On June 10th, his mom took him to a hospital in Clearfield, PA where they gave him steroids for his ear infection along with an IV and then released him. Brett felt better and continued camping with his family.After returning from camping, Brett would still occasionally feel upset to his stomach, but the family thought it was from his ear infection. On June 22nd, Brett made the trip to Iowa to spend time with his grandpa. However, on June 23rd, Brett began vomiting uncontrollably and was rushed to University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in Iowa City. When Brett Was DiagnosedAt Stead Family Children's Hospital, they conducted an MRI. Brett was kept in the hospital over the weekend while he and his family anxiously waited for the results. His parents were notified Brett had a mass on his brain and surgery to remove the brain tumor was scheduled.On June 26, Brett had surgery to remove the tumor. What was supposed to be a five-hour surgery turned into a terrifying thirteen-hour waiting game while surgeons tried to remove the brain tumor.A biopsy of the tumor was taken and a week later it was confirmed that Brett had a Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). What is a Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)Glioblastoma Multiforme is an aggressive brain cancer that can cause nausea, vomiting, headaches, speech problems and even seizures. Surgery alone cannot remove the entirety of the tumor because glioblastoma grows on healthy brain tissue. This means chemotherapy, radiation, and other forms of aggressive treatment are needed to fight the tumor. Glioblastoma Multiforme is VERY rare in children. Brett's Treatment So FarBrett has had three surgeries:The first surgery took four hours. This surgery was to place an EVD (external ventricular drain) to drain brain fluid. This allowed enough pressure to be taken off his brain so the doctors could prepare for the surgery to remove the tumor.The second surgery was scheduled for five hours but ended up taking over thirteen hours. This surgery was to remove the brain tumor.The third surgery took five hours. This surgery was to place a permanent shunt (tube) that runs from Brett's brain to his stomach. This allows the excess brain fluid he is unable to absorb to drain into his stomach. What is NextBrett has now been transferred to Duke Medical Center in North Carolina. On July 19th, Brett and his dad met with the Duke Medical team (including neuro-oncology director and staff, neuro-surgery director and staff, and radiation director and staff) and discussed what his immediate treatment plan would be as well as the side effects, prospects, etc.Brett's first treatments will be a type of chemotherapy (Temozolomide) in pill form and radiation daily for six to seven weeks at Duke. The doctors have informed the family that this has about a 25% chance of working on Brett's glioblastoma. There will be more treatments after the initial chemo and radiation for approximately one year, but the doctors are hopeful that Brett will be able to return to normal activities after a few weeks post radiation. How You Can HelpAny donation size is helpful. Three $10 donations equal $30. That could be one less meal the family has to pay for.If you are unable to contribute monetarily you can share Brett's GoFundMe page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even through text. GoFundMe believes ""Sharing your GoFundMe on Facebook can increase donations by 350%.""Don't have a social media account? Try talking to someone in person. GoFundMe predicts, ""a face to face ask is 34 times more effective than an email.""  The more people who hear about Brett's story means more donations. Every little bit helps! How Will the Funds Be UsedBrett's journey is just beginning. Instead of taking drivers ed with his friends Brett is going to start chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Instead of going to movies on the weekend or staying up all night playing video games he will be spending countless days, weeks, months, in and out of the hospital.The first round of treatment is going to last approximately one year with multiple trips and stays in the Durham area which will be extremely costly. For example, during Brett's first six to seven week chemo and radiation treatments the doctors said Brett would not be able to handle the three to four hours every day it would take to travel for his treatments. His dad has found lodging close to the hospital that could hold the family, but it will cost approximately $4,000 for the first six weeks. That is just a place to stay, that does not include meals.His dad is also getting an in-home tutor for Brett so he will not fall behind when he is too ill to go to school.  Because Brett's mom and brothers live in Ohio, there will be numerous travel costs. Road trip costs include money for gas, food, and hotel. That doesn't take into consideration any emergency trips when the family will have to pay for last minute airline tickets. The closest major airports to his mom's home in Ohio is Detroit, MI or Cleveland, OH. The nearest major airport to Duke Medical Center and Brett's home in Pinehurst is Raleigh, NC.  Last minute airfare for three people (Brett's mom and two brothers) from Detroit to Raleigh is approximately $1500. That is a conservative quote.Brett's mother will also have to take unpaid days off of work to travel to see her son. And when his brothers are unable to make the trip the family will need to find childcare. Help Brett and His Family!While some of the costs may be small (a tank of gas may cost less than $50) everything adds up. Brett's family shouldn't have to worry if they can afford a last minute flight for an emergency procedure or be concerned about how much debt they will accrue living near the hospital while Brett has treatments. By supporting Brett's GoFundMe you're helping Brett and his family concentrate on beating cancer instead of agonizing over their bank account. This summer Brett and his family have been living a nightmare.

Reggie, the patriarch has been the provider, the loving husband and father and an extraordinary physician.  To witness Gervel and his children respond with so much enduring love and strength to be an advocate for his care brings tears of hope.  Amani  came home to assist with  her daddy's medical practice  and Reggie Jr. dropped out of college to take care of his mother and his daddy.Reggie was discharged on February 27, 2018 from the hospital and is at home now but his recovery continues. Although he is happy to be home with his family, his journey to recovery will be long, arduous and expensive. Reggie’s fighting spirit is inspirational.  Through the amazing grace of his loving wife and children, he is determined to get better.The medical expenditures far exceeded insurance reimbursements not to mention insurance denial of payments (not covered).  Medical (Medicare) insurance will only provide limited resources and reimbursements. It is up to his wife, Gervel and his children to take care of him 24/7. He will need home healthcare, extensive physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, medication, medical supplies, follow up physician visits and medical transport.The Sampson family is blessed with so many incredible AMAZING friends, family, patients and acquaintances that are looking for a way to help Reggie, Gervel, Amani, and Reggie Jr. with his long-term continuum care. Go Fund Me is now available for all of us (it takes a village) to pull additional resources to help Reggie with his care and for his loving family. We all want Reggie to get better soon!!!!! A man that has touched and given  much to so many people, patients and the medical community deserves a fighting chance.  All donations and support are sincerely appreciated with unconditional love.   Thank youPlease follow Reggie , Gervel and Family Love Story Album on  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gervel.jonessampson/media_set?set=a.10213818885124793.1073741961.1187261410&type=3&pnref=lhc#ReggieRecover",221,859,2,221,5 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,54,Jill's Surgery,https://www.gofundme.com/jill039s-surgery,"OCALA, FL","July 31, 2018","$59,010","$44,178","Thank you for any help you can give, prayer and or financial. Our need:Jill has a surgery scheduled September 12 for a craniotomy. We have Medishare for insurance. The surgeon is accepting them as ""in network"" and will process billing after surgery. The hospital wants us to pay their portion and the anesthesiologist up front before confirming and moving forward. Medishare's policy is to not pay upfront (I don't blame them and understand). Medishare is going to contact the hospital and see if they can convince them to make an exception. We are currently sitting with an up front cash payment of $59010 which needs to be paid imediately. They are giving us a 50% discount. There is an urgency because every week that goes by greater symptoms and problems develope for Jill. Whats going on with Jill:My wife Jill Salter, has a Pineal gland cyst that has to be removed. November 2016 she started having dizziness and struggled with remembering things. We weren't sure what was going on but kept an eye on the symptoms that would come and go. March 2017 Jill had symptoms that resembled a stroke. We took her to Shands ER where they ran EKG, Cat scan, and other tests. They told her she had vertigo. Our family doctor sent her for an MRI. The results came back ""clear"". However the symptoms became frequent and resembled seizures, happening every week or two and left her with several days recovery each time. In March of 2018 she started having bad ""seizure"" episodes that would last up to four hours and no less that one hour but the residual effects would last for days. She would have slurred speach, couldn't answer basic questions, slowed motor skills and extreme dizziness. We took her in imediately for another MRI where we were informed a cyst they previously found had grown 40% in one year. Since then what we thought were seizures have been identified as pressure on the brain and what happens is the brain shuts down till it can cope again. These cysts can also cause hearing and vision loss which she has recently started experiencing. She now has these pressure episodes on average once a day lasting one to four hours. Jill has been unable to work for  over a year. Performing basic household tasks can be a major challenge as well. The surgeon Dr Dong Kim in Houston has some great info and an impeccable track record in dealing with this issue. When he met Jill he felt she was an extreme case, most people have episodes lasting one to ten minutes. The reality is these episodes are a result of to much pressure on the brain Wich can end up having permanent effects. With this surgery, Dr Kim has had 100% positive results varying from restoration of quality of life to full restoration.Here's a link to understand the issue and surgery: http://neuro.memorialhermann.org/pineal-cysts/Medishare works by submitting a bill and is paid by a pool of resources donated by it's members. Someone asked me ""what happens if Medishare pays, where do these funds go?"" These funds will pay for this medical bill and any overages will go back into the Medishare pool so other people who have life changing issues will have confidence that your help has granted them another chance at life.We have peace through all this.  Our faith is that God will provide. While we don't understand it at we know He is good and His mercy endures forever. Thankfor your help! Cory & Jill Salter",159,1.4k,4,191,1 month,7 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,54,Move Jordan to Boston Child Hosp,https://www.gofundme.com/move-jordan-to-boston-child-hosp,"TRUMBULL, CT","March 14, 2018","$30,000","$32,500","Meet Jordan Chance. This little child had endured so much in his short lifetime.  He has spent most of his life in a FL hospital but, it has become abundantly clear the hospital is not able to care for his special needs any longer. Boston Children’s Hospital has agreed to take on Jordan’s very special case. Jordan will be airlifted to BCH and start his new journey there but, his family is struggling with the already tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills that have accrued. We are hoping to raise enough money to pay for Jordan’s journey to BCH as well as help his family move to Boston for a short time. Please consider donating to Jordan and his family so he may start a new life in Boston. ❤️Here is the SHORT version of his long story...With no prior indications of any issues in utero, at birth Jordan was diagnosed with cleft soft palate, atrial septal defect, heart murmur, hypotonia, jaundice, sepsis, pelvocaliectasis, hypomagnesemia, hypospadias, micrognathia, retronathia, recessed tounge, airway obstruction, severe GERD, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonic stenosis, anemia, dialed kidneys, apnea, bradycardia and failure to thrive. Shortly after birth he was diagnosed with Pierre Robin Sequence, a congenital condition of facial abnormalities. PRS is a sequence or chain of certain developmental malformations. The main features are cleft palate, micrognathia, (abnormal positioning of the jaw), retrognathia and glossoptosis (airway obstruction caused by backwards displacement of the tongue). This combination of features typically lead to difficulty breathing and feeding issues. Many months later he was also diagnosed with horizontal nystagmus and conductive hearing loss due to fluid in his ears from the cleft palate. He has had to have bilateral PET tubes placed in both ears and replaced during the time of some of his surgeries. He was also diagnosed with hypoplasia on the left thumb and some neurological issues have been suspected but yet to be diagnosed. Some issues from birth have since resolved or improved over time (kidney, pulmonary, some heart and some facial feature issues). He has been hospitalized the good majority of his short life, and has underwent 10 surgeries so far resulting in many developmental delays, brachycephaly and additional feeding and swallowing regressions. Between countless ER visits and hospital admissions, his time at home was mostly filled with therapies (Feeding/speech, OT & PT) and his drs appointments with his many specialists. Since birth he has struggled with feeding, swallowing, breathing, choking, severe reflux, vomiting and failure to thrive. He has had to have several different types of feeding tubes placed and replaced to assist with nutrition. He has had many NG tubes and G tubes placed and replaced. He has had central lines and broviacs to provide emergency nutrients when feeding was not possible and to supplement feeding during the FTT time. He has also had GJ tubes placed and replaced and more recently ND tubes also placed and replaced, all of which have not been successful in one way or the other. He has had to have some major emergency surgeries to correct the undiscovered malrotation and volvulus discovered only during surgery. He also developed adhesions as a result and needed additional emergency surgery. He has had to deal with several complications from multiple surgeries, many infections and lots of still unresolved GI issues. Also during this current admission they have discovered some additional abnormalities in his stomach and duodenum in his GI tract. After 3 months of being hospitalized, he is currently only receiving nutrition through the broviac catheter leading directly into the heart. He has not been able to feed successfully after the last few major abdominal surgeries.Further genetic abnormalities have been suspected but have only in the very recent been discovered. A super rare DNA change has been found and located in the p part of chromosome 19. Inside chromosome 19p13.2, there is a new variant in the SMRCA4 gene. This is a super new, super rare finding which there is no information available yet for. He is only 1 of 5 in the world who have been diagnosed with this genetic mutation. There are no medical publishings and very limited studies conducted. It is believed that he is the only one in the US with this finding. What this all means to Jordan and his future is still unknown but may be related to many of his struggles. He has come a very long way but has a long road ahead of him. However even with all these issues he’s the best boy you’ll ever meet. He will sweep you off your feet and dive right into to your heart with his sweetness, good looks and charm. No matter what he goes through he always has a big smile on his face. We love Jordan and his parents, Pete and Ena, so much and we just want to see this little boy get a fighting chance! -Bonnie & Bryon",241,1.4k,6,240,5 months,3 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

That time is now for our wonderful friends Clay and Kimberly (Kevin Devaney’s twin sister) Rawn. As many of you know, Kim underwent a heart and double lung transplant a year and a half ago resulting from a terribly aggressive auto immune disease. While her amazing recovery is nothing short of a miracle, it is a daily battle fraught with numerous setbacks, endless medicines, procedures and constant travel back to San Francisco for doctor’s visits with her transplant team. In a cruel twist of fate, Kim’s husband Clay is now facing the battle of his life. Recently Clay underwent major surgery for colon cancer which has been determined to be stage 4, having spread to other organs. He had been Kim’s constant rock and caregiver during her medical crisis. Clay recently started chemo treatment, but it will be an uphill battle. Now they both need your help! Neither one of them has worked in over a year and their current medical insurance will soon end. The emotional, physical and financial burdens are more than anyone should have to bear. Please find it in your hearts to help out our dear friends who have given back so much over the years.

Like many families, we have asked that question time-and-time again since we learned that Tony was diagnosed with stage 4 Lung Cancer. Cancer does not care that Tony represents what is best in our humanity: because cancer is blind, because cancer has no empathy.So cancer has decided to try and take Tony from us, from this world, a truly special soul.  We as Tony’s family and friends are asking all who can, to help us fight cancer and to prolong a souls life. In asking this we also understand you will ask ""Why this one man?"" – ""why Tony Lake.""  We do not write these words lightly, nor take for granted the weight of categorizing Tony as a ""truly special soul."" But we must answer the ""why"" for each of you to give.First Tony falls into the category of those who choose kindness… who choose to light the world with understanding, generosity, patience and goodness, even though his younger days were filled with darkness. As a child who incurred the wrath of an alcoholic and loss of a brother, he decided to protect those around him, regardless of what that meant for him.Tony then chose to serve his country, and it was there as a Navy Sea Bee that his foundation as a union member in LIUNA and his talent in all phases of construction was nurtured. After serving, Tony strapped his meager belongings to his motorcycle and drove from the west coast to the east coast. There he married the love of his life, a single mom with two kids – both who easily called him ""dad."" Two more kids and a home were added on a single income of a construction worker; an income that would also support the care of two critically ill parents. An avid mountain biker, Tony thought he had injured his ribs in a fall. Instead the cancer gave him an inoperable tumor that grew to crack two ribs. Inside the lung the cancer also sits and waits. Traditional treatments have slightly reduced the larger tumor, but without targeted and new treatments, Tony’s life expectancy is 6 months. Insurance will not cover these prolonging treatments.While not of retirement age he will soon be forced to retire on a limited income, one that cannot pay for any new treatments much less continue with his present treatments. As his family we want more for Tony, because he has given so much to so many. Why should you decide to help this one man? Because the world is truly a better place with Tony in it.Thank you.",193,548,10,196,1 month,20 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Frankie stepped in to defend his friend when the man threw Frankie to the ground and curb stomped his right leg as he was attempting to crawl away. His right knee cap was shattered, and right tibia fractured.He was admitted to Phoenix St. Lukes later that night. His leg was temporarily set and he was discharged 2 days later after inflammation subsided, but he is still awaiting surgery to set the bone and repair his knee.Frankie has impacted so many people in Phoenix's LGBTQ+ community. He's served as impromptu therapist and listened while we poured our heart and soul out, he's helped us feel confident with our image and love ourselves, he's gone out of his way to defend his family and chosen family when one of them is threatened. He's done nothing but love Phoenix and the people in this city and it's time for us to return the favor.No one deserves the amount of hate and pain Frankie has been forced to endure. While none of us are orthopedic surgeons, we can all help out in other ways. Frankie is going to need to be off his feet for post-surgery recovery and will be unable to work and support himself financially. He is also without health insurance and will have to pay for his hospital and surgical bills out of pocket. If you have to means, please help contribute.

Battling an advanced form of cancer is challenging in any circumstance, but in Venezuela, a country suffering a widespread humanitarian crisis, it can feel impossible.I support myself and my 5 year-old daughter illustrating children’s books. Venezuela’s runaway hyperinflation, has cut my income to less than USD $20 a month. For this same reason, my insurance only pays USD $15 for my cancer treatment.The challengesFor years, Venezuela has made international headlines for its severe food and medicine shortages. We are currently experiencing the highest inflation rates in the world and a crisis with no end in sight.Millions have fled the country, seeking refuge abroad. I chose to stay in Venezuela to care for my mother, and protect my family’s small dairy farm. Even if I find the resources to pay for treatment, the life-saving immunotherapy drugs I need aren’t available in Venezuela. I will have to source the drugs internationally, which could add hundreds of thousands of dollars  to the cost of my treatment. Nobody wants to plead for money from friends and family, but I have no choice. I simply cannot pay for treatment on my own.I am only 44 years old and I have every intention of seeing my daughter, Iroma, grow into a beautiful young woman.

Soy madre de una niña de apenas cinco añitos, a quién mantengo con mis ingresos como ilustradora de cuentos para niños.Superar un cáncer y pagar los gastos de un tratamiento tan costoso es una proeza en cualquier país, pero en la Venezuela de hoy, sumergida en una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes en su historia, la lucha es mucho más cuesta arriba.Debido a la hiperinflación en Venezuela, la más alta del mundo, y a la aberración en los controles de cambio, mis ingresos equivalen apenas a menos de $20 dólares al mes. Mi seguro sólo cubre unos $15 dólares para gastos médicos. Enfermarse en Venezuela cuesta la vida En Venezuela, la escasez crónica de comida y medicinas cobra vidas a diario. Millones de Venezolanos se han visto obligados a abandonar el país en busca de protección y una vida digna. Decidí quedarme en mi país para cuidar de mi madre, y proteger nuestra pequeña granja familiar en Los Andes, que se ha visto amenazada por invasores.Incluso si tuviese los recursos económicos para pagar mi tratamiento, los medicamentos que necesito para la inmunoterapia que me salvaría la vida no están disponibles en Venezuela. Para recibir el tratamiento, tendría que importarlos o trasladarme a otro país, lo que podría añadir cientos de miles de dólares al costo de mi tratamiento. A nadie le gusta pedir dinero a sus amigos y familiares, pero no tengo ninguna otra opción, ya que simplemente no tengo los recursos para pagar los costos yo misma.Tengo sólo 44 años, mi mayor anhelo es proteger a mi hija Iroma y verla crecer. No permitiré que el cáncer o la crisis de Venezuela me de por vencida. Te pido por favor que me ayudes a luchar contra esta enfermedad y mis circunstancias.  Las donaciones serán utilizadas para pagar por los medicamentos, cirugías y demás gastos médicos. Cualquier monto es bienvenido y ayuda a llegar a nuestra meta de $50 mil dólares.  Cada ayuda es un regalo que significa el mundo para mi.  Gracias por tu ayuda y compasión,  Laura-------私はラウラといいます。ベネズエラで、私の保険では１５ドルしか出ないのですが、私の治 療にかかる医療費は、５万ドル以上です。診断されたガンは、ステージ3の悪性黒色腫で、皮膚がんの中で、 一番致死的な種類です。ステージ３のガンと戦うことは、どこでも辛いことですが、人道上 の危機にあるベネズエラの場合、本当に、それは無理に思えます。今、絵本のイラストを描く仕事で、自分と５歳の娘の生活費を稼い でいますが、ハイパーインフレーションの影響で、今の月給は、約 ２０ドルしか貰えません。実は、お金が完全に用意できても、それだけで治すことはできませ ん。必要な免疫療法薬物は、ベネズエラでは販売していないため、 外国で探すことが必要になります。親戚や友達、知り合いの皆に、こういうお願いすることは、自分に とって物凄く大変なことですが、自分の力だけでは、医療費を絶対 に支払うことが出来ません。44歳のお母さんとして、娘のイロマちゃんを立派な女性になるま で、必ず一緒にいたいんです。私は、 ガンやベネズエラの金融危機に、絶対に負けたくない！どうか助けてください、この大変な状態を乗り越えて、私は、病気 に打ち勝ちたい。皆の寄付で、イタリアのミラノで治療が受けられる可能性がありま すが、ビザを取るためには、 医療費をちゃんと支払えることを確認し、約束するための書類が必 要となります。皆の協力は、何よりも宝物です。みんなを愛しています。本当にあ りがとうございます。ラウラ---------

He was having an amazing time riding camels and exploring - all while wearing a replica Indiana Jones hat!About two weeks in, Nathan came down with symptoms that looked like traveler's sickness. My cousins took him to see a doctor where he was hydrated and given some antibiotics. Days later, he still was not improving - in fact, he was getting worse. He was so weak that he could not even stand. My cousins took him to a hospital where he became worse and worse, until he was in a coma-like state.My mom started working with his traveler's insurance to get him back to the States for better treatment, but he was not stable enough to move that far. It was ultimately decided that he would be flown to Paris, France. Luckily, his traveler's insurance covered my mom's flight to Paris and she was there to meet him when he arrived. The French medical staff told her that he had not been properly treated while in Morocco. Nathan had a bacterial infection, was on a ventilator, was close to kidney failure, and had had at least one seizure.  His kidneys are functioning better now, but he has had another seizure. He was moved to another hospital in Paris to be treated by a specialist, but his initial diagnosis was found to be incorrect. He is still only minimally conscious and we know that the road to recovery is going to be a long one.My family is hard-working and we do not have much. While our focus is on Nathan, we cannot help but worry about how we are going to pay for his international healthcare after his traveler's insurance stops covering care. Nathan and my mom are on BadgerCare, which does not cover healthcare internationally. Nathan was very lucky to be included in my cousin's travel plans and budget and, as a hard worker himself, was able to pay for his plane ticket to Morocco with his own savings from working at the Lake Geneva Cruise Line. My mom works for hourly wages and is currently not working as she is with Nathan in France - we have no money coming in. I am a graduate student and do not have much to begin with. I am leaving to see my little brother soon, which means that I won't be working either.We need a lot of support. Your donation will help my family with...-Plane tickets-Lodging-Food-Medical expenses-To help us stay on our feet after Nathan gets better and my family has not been workingWe have already accumulated $4,200 worth of medical expenses from Nathan's care in Morocco and nearly $26,000 worth of medical expenses from Nathan's current hospital in Paris; this does not include the first hospital that he was treated at in Paris and the additional costs that build up with each passing day. While news sources are emphasizing our efforts to bring Nathan back to the United States as soon as possible, he does not have a diagnosis. Because we do not know what is causing his illness yet, we do not know if he is stable or what other complications may arise if he tries to fly right away. We do not know when he will be able to fly the distance from France to Wisconsin.  This GoFundMe will be used to address all of the above listed costs as they arise - not just the potential full cost of an air ambulance. Nathan is a smart, talented guy with the driest sense of humor and a lot of fight in him.

A family who is filled with such love and hope during their difficult journey, that they are inspiring everyone they meet. Their baby boy needs your help today…Meet Jason Jagdeo and Marissa Naidoo-Jagdeo…loving parents of Baby Michael Anthony Jagdeo (their little Hero aka “Miracle Mikey”).    Background: On November 2nd, 2015, Jason and Marissa’s lives changed forever; their beautiful angel, Michael Anthony Jagdeo, was born. Unfortunately, his birth was so traumatic that it became life-threatening to both mommy and baby. By nothing short of a miracle, they both survived. We’ve affectionately nicknamed him our “Miracle Mikey”.Mikey was kept in NICU for 3 weeks…fighting for his life. He had suffered brain damage, so extensive that doctors predicted that he would never walk or talk; this news devastated his parents, but they never gave up hope! They have faith that Mikey will defy all odds.On his second day of life, Mikey’s seizures began … and evolved over time, into a rare form of epilepsy, West Syndrome, resulting in hundreds of daily seizures. They were told that there is no cure and coupled with Mikey’s extensive brain damage, his prognosis was extremely poor. Yet, his parents never gave up hope. Together with a team of doctors, they cycled through many different combinations of medicines until they found a regime which drastically reduced his seizures! Doctors were amazed! Another miracle! However, because of the extent of his brain damage, doctors predict that his seizures would continue to evolve over his lifetime…and now, they have begun to evolve. Although heartbroken, his parents have faith that Mikey’s healing is on the way! They embody this quote: “where there is great love…there are always miracles.” There is no doubt that because of their unwavering love, faith and devotion, Mikey will continue to defy all odds.How you can help:                                                                                              For the first time, in a long time, this beautiful family has been given some hope. The specialists have ruled out surgery as an option because Mikey’s brain damage is too widespread. They have instead recommended Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy to improve his quality of life and to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, his seizures. Since Mikey continues to defy all odds, his family believes that another miracle is in the making. To see Mikey walk, talk, run and play one day would be the greatest blessing ever.However, to avoid any untoward adverse effects as a result of Mikey’s extensive brain injury and the complex, evolving nature of his seizure disorder, this specialized treatment would have to be accessed out of country, under the careful guidance of a specialist with more than 30 years experience in treating children with seizure disorders.We would need to raise at least US$89,000.00 to make Mikey’s dream a reality. Through your kindness today, we can do this!Mikey is a little hero who bravely fights his battles every day and lights up the world with his love! He is an angel on this earth, whose eyes radiate hope and determination. He just needs a little help from you right now to get him to his breakthrough.His parents are two of the most beautiful souls you will ever meet. Despite their difficult journey, they are uplifting and inspiring everyone with their love, faith and joy! To see them in tears shatters your heart to pieces. They are blessings to others; let us bless them in return with our kindness. They wish to do everything possible for Mikey because they have faith that he will do the impossible…as he has done thus far! His story is truly a miracle in motion…..",290,2.0k,5,284,2 months,4 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,55,For Amy(Kennel)Lott Cancer Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/amykennellott,"PORTLAND, OR","June 25, 2018","$70,000","$32,230","￼￼￼Shortly after Mother's Day, our family was rocked by the news that Amy was diagnosed with aggressive Stage 4 Uterine Cancer that had spread to the lining of her abdomen. Two weeks later she was in Chicago at Northwestern Hospital undergoing the removal of her uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and the omentum where tumors were found. The surgery was successful in removing everything more than 1 centimeter but we learned that there was a splattering of tiny spots of cancer scattered throughout her pelvic/abdominal area.  Her pathology report came back and after deep research and  many conversations with Gynecological Oncologists and Naturopathic Oncologists,  she and Mike faced the hard reality that the traditional route--- Surgery/High Dose Chemotherapy/ Radiation- has a very poor success rate.They were told that chemotherapy would not be curative. Chemo isn't as successful because this type of cancer has a high and rapid recurrence rate that can happen even before the body has recovered from the initial round of chemo.  This leaves patients who can't do more chemo with no treatment options to handle the recurrence.With this reality facing her, Amy and Mike, after much prayer, feel that traditional chemo is the wrong choice for her and have made the decision to seek Integrative Naturopathic treatment- that combines low dose chemo and immune boosting therapies to help her body become stronger. She and Mike will leave for a clinic near the US/Mexico border on July 19th. They expect to be at the clinic for 3 to 5 weeks and will then return with a plan she will continue at home. While the Naturopathic choice may seem bold to us at first, in reality she has made a very logical decision to reject traditional treatment. Our family is behind her decision 100% and believe that God has led her down this path for a reason. Since Amy's health insurance only covers the conventional chemo/radiation route, we are asking friends and family to help us raise money to make the financial side of this a little easier to bear so that Amy can focus on healing and strength to keep up with their two precious and energetic boys. The costs include time at the clinic, at home treatment costs, supplements, infusions, missed wages and travel.We ask you continue to pray for Mike, Amy, Evan and Andrew and for our entire family. Thanks to the power of your continued prayer, we have felt our initial devastation lift and the light of God's promises start shining through. Thank you for continuing to pray for healing, wisdom and lots of joy filled days as we embrace this detour with determination.[When you pray, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.— James 1:6]",181,1.1k,12,180,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,55,Help Nick fight Cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-nick-fight-cancer,"RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, CA","June 18, 2018","$125,000","$32,218","Hi there! My name is Atianna and I am asking you to please help save my son Nick’s life! Nick was Diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma on May 24, 2018.Help Save ‘Super Nick’! We need you!I'm a Single Mom of Three Kids.Nick is a 4 year old little boy with two siblings; Jasmine 12 and David 7. My beautiful son, Nick, is the bravest and most amazing person I have ever known  in my life. His smile hardly ever seems to leave his face. His warm and silly personality has everyone falling head over heels for him. Our nurses never seem to forget him! Nurses visit our room from all floors of the hospital just to say hello, as he leaves a lasting impression with everyone. Choc hospital has named my sweet little boy, ‘Super Nick’ because of his continuous positive spirit and endless level of courage! Our nurses made a poster ‘Super Nicks Room’ and hung it on his hospital room door for everyone to see!Our story began in the most complex and confusing way.. Nick appeared perfectly healthy without any health issues prior to dropping him off to school and rushing to work one morning. It all started as a regular day at school for Nick.. Until he jumped from a little toddler slide while playing at school and hurt his ankle. When I picked him up from school that day, we rushed to our pediatrician and then to mission hospital for an X-ray.. no breaks or fractures were found...we were sent home. Strangely, Nicks pain did not improve with each passing day and instead traveled to his hip and thigh area. With numerous visits to the doctor, including an orthopedic specialist and repeated X-rays, we were told that it was an assumed pulled muscle that should heal with some time.Nicks pain was horrific, unexplainable and worrisome. I took my 4 year old baby boy to our pediatrician a handful of times, each time asking why the pain was traveling to different areas of his legs and back.. each time we were sent home without the right answer. We were distracted by the fall and by Nicks healthy weight, appetite and demeanor. Our pediatrician decided to get some blood tests taken from Nick.. One abnormal lab led us to CHOC children’s hospital Emergency Room, where we came in contact with a very special Doctor that said she would admit us and not let us leave until she got to the bottom of this. Nicks labs were taken again and had worsened from the last ones taken. The following day Nick had an emergency MRI and Catscan done under anesthesia. Soon the sky became dark as we were given the diagnosis of Stage IV High Risk neuroblastoma cancer on May 24, 2018. My world truly turned upside down. How could my innocent child be given a 66% chance of survival from Choc and 30% survival from the cancer association?  All these numbers and statistics gave me little hope, until one day I had decided that we would fight as though we were certain that Nick was the surviving and thriving number. Currently, my son is being treated at CHOC children’s hospital in Orange, California.Over the next year and a half we have a road map set by the oncology team at CHOC that includes three phases of aggressive treatment.  Nicky will endure 2 surgeries within the first phase of treatment which includes 6 rounds of of aggressive inpatient chemotherapy, the retrieval of stem cells from Nick that will be frozen and used to ‘save him’ after intense radiation and ongoing high doses of chemo in phase two of treatment.  Phase 2 of treatment will include 6 weeks of continuous inpatient stay for three cycles with 3 to 4 week breaks in between.. and finally, a stem cell transplant (using his own stem cells) during his Immunotherapy in phase 3 of treatment to ‘save him’ from the damage that radiation and chemo will cause. There is a hope for the possibility of more advanced treatment in Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital of N.Y. that is the one and only facility to offer cancer vaccines to protect patients from reoccurring cancer after treatment.Nick will be treated with 3F8, which is Memorial Sloan Kettering's proprietary antibody against GD2. It is an experimental medication waiting to be approved by the FDA. It is made only at Memorial Sloan Kettering and other hospitals don't have access to it at this time.Also, Memorial Sloan Kettering has a clinical trial ongoing for a vaccine therapy after GD2 therapy, but it is only available on trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering, CHOC doesn’t  have access to it. Memorial Sloan Kettering treatment is different than what most other centers are using as ‘standard of care’ for this type of rare and aggressive form of cancer. We would end up living in New York  periodically for 2 -3 months each time, getting rounds of radiation and numerous rounds of immune and antibody therapies.  I have been tirelessly searching for more options.  Through outreach to many doctors and organizations, Nick has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help Nick in his battle with Neuroblastoma cancer!Phase 2  of treatment for Nick, will consist of 6 weeks inpatient of radiation and chemo at a time, then home for a short while and back again with three rotations like this. If Nick survives then phase 3 of treatment begins, which is what we look forward to, Immuno therapy. The doctors explained that Nicks risks are, infertility, deafness, becoming cross eyed, severe pain from radiation, learning disabilities, relapse of cancer, new types of cancers that can be caused by the treatment, and much more. This is all an absolute nightmare. We pray that Nick will fight this cancer and win!! We will fight this battle with him! He is the strongest, bravest, funniest, most affectionate little boy in the world! Nick loves music, it makes him feel better. He receives music therapy at CHOC to cheer him up and heal his spirit. This picture was taken during Nicks first round of chemo just a week after we were diagnosed.Excited to be home and all together for the first day! Siblings were in deep heart ache to be separated during Nicks hospital stay. We had difficulty finding help to watch David and Jasmine during Nicks first round, which was a long 3 week stay. We hoped to have two weeks home together before returning to the hospital for round two of inpatient chemo but we had two emergency trips to the hospital for infections, fevers, hives and more, that unfortunately kept us away from home for almost all of the duration of our anticipated ‘home time’ together. This has been painful for all of us. Watching Nick suffer and being split apart from one another during our hospital stays, has left each of us broken.I had to stop working as soon as Nick was diagnosed, hospital expenses and bills are piling up. I am a single mother and have no idea how I will support my family with this horrible diagnosis and time that I must and will always spend at Nicks bedside. We are in a desperate need of financial resources to help sustain treatment, alternative medications and all expenses that this crisis has brought upon our family.The cost for alternative treatment is substantial, and the need to start is urgent!

In July 2018, she was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma. She started receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital (MSK) in New York City starting July 11th.  She has since tested negative for presence of the disease in her bone marrow, an encouraging result. Willa’s doctor specializes in this disease and is walking the Pauletti family through each step of this process. Each day new tests are being done to see what treatments Willa's body will and will not tolerate, so the days are long for everyone involved. At this time, it is expected that treatment will last at least the next six-eight  months. Miss Willa is proving to be a real champ through all the poking, prodding, sometimes-scary procedures and being cooped up — not a preschooler's idea of a good time. Looking down the road, the Pauletti family is going to need lots of love and support in many forms to face this disease head on. There are a few tangible needs that will need to be taken care of right away, and many expenses the family will incur while seeking treatment for Willa in the coming months. What we've learned so far about the path ahead is that Willa's immune system is going to be fighting hard, so as she moves from the hospital to their home for her monthly chemotherapy treatments, increased and ongoing deep cleaning of the Pauletti's home, plus a hospital grade air purifier will be important. Frequent appointment trips to Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital for treatments brings the associated gas, parking, and tolls.  Heidi and Gregg have diligently stood watch at Willa's bedside for days now, and will continue to do so, taking respite at the Ronald McDonald House nearby in short bursts. So far, this has not incurred a cost, but  there is a maximum stay limitation which we anticipate meeting before treatment is complete for Willa. This campaign has been initiated to defray the cost of supporting the clean home environment Willa needs to heal and the ongoing unexpected costs of travel, childcare, lodging and equipment, the medical/ drug costs we are learning will not be covered, and other needs that the Pauletti family will have to get Willa the treatment  and care required. With time, more will become clear about how Willa's treatment plan will affect the family's lives with regard to missed work, etc. As we understand what else may be required, we will update this campaign to help offset the burden for the Pauletti's.Thank you for all your continued support and prayers for the Pauletti family. Anyone who has or knows children, knows how heart-wrenching this fight will be. Anyone who knows Heidi and Gregg Pauletti knows there are no stronger, more vigilant, more fiercely loving people to support Willa in her fight. Join us in standing behind them and showing your support as they bravely face this challenge head on.With Gratitude, Friends of The Pauletti FamilyTo learn more about Willa's journey:   https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/willapauletti",205,598,2,204,1 month,1 day ago,2 days,2018-09-03

Upon the procedure, just days later, the surgery revealed 3 dark spots in which the doctor biopsied. In less than 1 week, we received Casey’s diagnosis of stage 4, Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Casey, due to severe pain and inability to swallow, has lost 33 pounds in about 6 weeks. He’s been unable to work since November 2017. The local Cancer Institute proposed their method for this aggressive deadly cancer. It involved minimal chemotheropy AND TOTAL removal of Casey's tongue. Additionally he will receive heavy radical radiation, surgical addition of a permanent lifetime airway tube and a feeding tube.  The success rate of this method is 40% and life expectancy of only 3-5yrs. After frantically researching for a treatment with a more positive outcome, Casey and his family were directed to University of Chicago Medical Center. The Oncology team, after meeting Casey, projected hope. A 6 session plan of simotanious  chemotherapy and radiation for 5 days. He will receive 6 sessions of these 5 day treatments, one week on and one week off. Casey announced he is ready to fight and undergo the intense, painful treatment to try to save his tongue and his life. The Chicago Cancer team has started fighting Casey's deadly cancer 1 week after meeting in April 2018. Casey will undergo 10-12 weeks of ""In & Out"" treatment and quite a bit of time rehab and recovery. The family is working diligently, with help from the hospital and friends, to secure living quarters while he is relocated for treatment in Chicago. Donations will help with travel, medical treatments, therapies, and living expenses. Casey may not be able to work for 9 -12 months due to the treatments and therapies to help save his life. The family is struggling to pay Casey's medical and personal expenses which have been mounting since November 2017.

He has battled two severe back surgeries, a heart attack, 2 existing aneurisms near the heart, and now this. Chuck began a treatment plan to include extensive oral surgery, and 7 weeks of radiation 5x per week and Chemo 1x per week mid June. By God’s grace he has been given an 80%+ cure rate though the effects of the treatment have been quite debilitating and painful to say the least. We expect the road to recovery to be long and costly, and by default, a prolonged period of yet again, being without income. So many of you have reached out and asked how to help, and for this we can not begin to express our sincere gratitude. For this reason, please know that contributing to this fund will be extremely helpful to meet medical and living expenses that have accrued from the beginning and continue to grow.

Gary is an immensely private person. He appreciates all our support but is not comfortable discussing the details of what is going on in his life right now. We have been working hard to find a way to help him and his family in a manner that is respectful of his privacy. Gary has been with the school for 15 years. Even as Gary and his family navigate through Mrs. Rooplal's illness, Gary continues to greet every student, staff member, parent and visitor by name with his trademark smile, humor and positivity. Gary treats each of our children as his own. He welcomes them each morning by name and escorts them to their bus or carpool with a personal goodbye as well. He is completely dedicated to our students, ensuring they are safe and feel secure and supported throughout the school day.Now it is time for us to demonstrate our support to Gary and his family in return. Please consider contributing to our campaign, any and all donations are welcome. Please note:1. Donations can be anonymous.2. Please feel free to forward this to anyone who would want to help.3.

This was an unexpected and shocking discovery.  God’s hand and favor has been evident in the process from the beginning as the diagnosis was made quickly and the medical care has been initially covered by a local medical charity for those without insurance.  The overall prognosis is good, but it’s clear that the road to recovery ahead will not be an easy one.  He is looking at SIX MONTHS of being home for treatment and recovers. TWO MONTHS of AGGRESSIVE CHEMO & RADIATION,  and then FOUR MONTHS of RECOVERY and possible surgery.  The charity has limited resources, so there will be medical bills Jason and Gina will have to cover.  Jason brings in the family’s main source of income through the ministry, which he will be unable to do for at least 6 months. There will be MEDICAL BILLS &  LIVING EXPENSES that need to be covered ASAP since Jason has been home all of March and will MISS SIX MONTHS OF WORK. Jason and Gina have sacrificed so much and passionately poured out their lives for the Lord and countless people for over 20 years.  They have deeply touched so many of our hearts.  Now is a beautiful opportunity to give back to them in their time of great need, both through our prayers and our financial support.  Their faith through this process has been incredible and they are believing for a miracle and for God to receive much glory through this.  Let’s help carry them, surround them with love and support and believe with them for this miracle!"" Connie Wantling""It is with a burdened, but very hopeful, heart that I make this request of friends and family of Jason Lee Jones, my brother in law. Very recently he was diagnosed with throat cancer. For those that know him, you know that he is an extraordinary human being that has dedicated his life to God. The lives that Jason has touched and brought to God around the world is uncountable. His unending dedication and devotion to the Lord through his music and voice is his livelihood. That is why this disease, especially because of where it has afflicted him, is so crucial to hit head on and immediately with very aggressive radiation and chemotherapy. Jason is a strong man and very physically fit for his young age of 44. We know and believe that with your help he will be able to beat this disease with a full recovery to get him back on the road. Without insurance to cover the already increasing costs of unforeseen treatment, the next months are going to be difficult for him and his family. Your support during this time for Jason is going to allow him to focus on fighting and beating this disease without worrying about how he is going to be able to make ends meet for his family; his wife and two young children, since he will miss 6 MONTHS  of his traveling missionary & philanthropic work with The Godbreed & Iris Savannah . Even the smallest amount of financial support during this time will go a long way in helping the family. Please help us to give back to Jason and his family some of the love and support that they have so selflessly given of themselves through their dedication to the ministry over the past 20 + years. Even if you don’t have the means to help out financially, your love and prayers would be very well received. We appreciate every single one of you for all your love, gifts of time, prayer, love, or any creative support during this time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and will keep you updated on his status. God is good.""Kory & Andrea Reeves, your brother-in-law & sister.""One of my dearest friends. My brother (truly, don’t mess). I remember the phone call. The news. The surprise. The lament. The sorrow. But, more than all,  the hope. And the joy of Jesus over my brother's life. In the midst of my fear and confusion about it all...the thing he says continually? “The devil messed with the wrong man. I’m going to preach Jesus even harder and stronger than ever before. Even if I lose my voice, I will still shout Jesus in my inner man.” So thankful to know him and his family. In the midst of a cancer diagnosis, he has a true John the Baptist message (tattooed, big bearded, wild eyed and all)...”prepare the way of the Lord”. Find friends who call you higher. Especially in the midst of trial. Find friends who call you higher. Support and love looks like something. Nobody can be prepared for this kind of news practically. Let’s rally together.

After undergoing an unsuccessful round of chemotherapy in Croatia, he came to Boston in search of second-line treatment. Within a week of being here, the doctors discovered that he was suffering from another life-threatening condition, heart-failure brought about by acute cardiomyopathy. In short, the first round of chemo didn’t kill the cancer, but it did manage to kill his heart. Soon thereafter he underwent heart surgery to implant an LVAD (mechanical heart) and spent months in the hospital.Unfortunately, because of his heart condition, he would not be able to receive any more chemotherapy, nor any of the more cutting-edge treatments (stem cell and bone marrow transplantations, CAR-T cell therapy, etc.) taking place at Dana Farber. All that was left was radiation, which he underwent in January and again in April.  Last week, he underwent a PET scan, which revealed that the radiation did not work. The tumor on his neck has not only grown back aggressively, but as well, the cancer has spread to his lungs. While we knew the news from this appointment would likely present additional challenges, no one was ready to hear that the end may be upon us.With no more ‘western’ options available, Brett is not giving up and is as determined as ever to beat this. He’s taking his fight back to Europe, where he has found several alternative health clinics in Slovenia and Switzerland, which specialize in bio-energy. Not only do these clinics bring forth their own costs (starting at approx 50K for treatment), but as well, Brett and his wife Masa have been invested full-time in his recovery. As such, we would like to help him raise some money that would go towards travel costs, treatment, pain management, and if nothing else, a little bit of comfort.",153,284,0,155,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Jessica has returned to work for the last month to preserve medical insurance for our family. This has been extremely mentally/physically taxing on her to juggle work/going to the NICU/going home to Juliana. Mike has been unable to work so he could help balance being at the NICU and taking care of important appointments for Brenden while Jessica is at work.   Each day, specialists are seeing Brenden, evaluating him and making decisions...the nature of Mike's work would make it impossible for him to be there and work simultaneously. Now, we have found out that our insurance will not cover everything that Brenden will need to go home. While some  equipment is covered, he will need back up equipment (and back up for the back ups)....and 24/7 skilled nursing at home, among other expected expenses. We also will need to move from our apartment and get a different car to best accommodate Brenden’s needs. It’s going to take awhile to get him home. He has at least another 3-4 more weeks in the NICU (if all goes well). Then, he will be going to a rehab facility where they can train us on how to best take care of him. He had a tracheostomy on 6/12/18 and is going to have a gtube/feeding tube surgery on 6/19/18. He will require a ventilator at home. We need to become experts in how to care for all of that. During this time, neither of us can work, as we need to be present and with Brenden each day to learn...the faster we are trained, the faster he can come home. We don't know how long this part will take. A summer without Mike's income, after all of these months of him being unable to work while living off of one income and so many unexpected expenses, will definitely put us into a crisis financially.Then, once he can come home, depending on when that is, Jessica may need to take some days off from work to get Brenden settled.  She has exhausted her ""CAR"" days (personal/sick in bank) and already borrowed 18 days that she needs to repay to the DOE.  She has 4 weeks left of FMLA that she could take, if needed (which would be unpaid).  


At this point, the level of care Brenden will need after he gets home and as he grows older is unknown.So many people have reached out and asked how they can help...so here is our request. If you can’t donate, we would appreciate it if you could keep Brenden in your continued thoughts and prayers.

After a lumpectomy and lymph node removal surgery in March, her pathology indicated her cancer had spread. She is currently enduring 20 rounds of chemo, which will be followed by further surgery, radiation and then 10 years of hormone therapy. (Shelby is encouraging ALL her female friends to get mammograms. Her cancer was found during her 10th annual mammogram/sonogram. Her mother, a BC survivor, was diagnosed at 41 and her aunt was diagnosed at 35. Luckily, Shelby found out that she does not carry the gene). The really good news is that Shelby’s prognosis is for a full recovery.

Unfortunately, her recent rounds of chemo have made it too difficult for her to work. She recently had no choice but to leave her job. We don’t see her being able to work again until next year.

After almost 10 years together, you can imagine that Shelby’s cancer diagnosis has been such a blow to our family. We are all fighting and amazingly, Shelby is in good spirits most of the time! But with this sudden change of events we cannot survive on just one income. It’s quite hard for me to admit, but we have to ask for help. These times have shown me that I cannot do this alone. We are so blessed to have some great people surrounding us with love, prayers and support; however we can’t make it through without further assistance.


Any donations will go toward the following:

·     Mortgage and monthly bills

·     Medical bills

·     Emery’s daycare tuition

·     Childcare and healthcare during Shelby 2nd surgical recovery

·     Grocery delivery


I’m hoping we can all come together some way and make a big difference. Every penny counts and we appreciate each one!

Your generosity will help ensure that Neha and her parents, along with her healthy brother, have as much quality time together as possible.  Your contributions will also help purchase critical medical equipment that Neha needs to live as dignified and as comfortable a life as possible, as the illness continues to take hold of her.

Neha is in immediate need of critical and costly medical equipment, the claims for which insurance has unfathomably denied.  Specifically, Neha’s care requires specialized equipment for showering and personal care (a specialized toilet seat and a “stander” device will help Neha stand in the shower).Beyond medical equipment, Neha requires care beyond what her parents can provide. Her condition requires non-stop medical attention to ensure she’s breathing, so her parents alternate between working daytime and night-time hours so that one parent can be constantly by her side. Neha’s father works days as a pharmacist and stays up all night to assist her; Neha’s mother works the night-shift at the US Postal Service, comes home and sleeps for just a few hours, then tends to her daughter throughout the day.  Your support will allow Neha’s parents to purchase medical equipment and bring on part-time professional help that will enable them to focus on enjoying the only gift that matters – precious and limited time with their beloved daughter.  How you can help:1. Please give generously to help Neha get the medical devices she requires and the quality time with her family she deserves to enhance the dignity of her life.2. Please forward this GoFundMe campaign to at least 5 people.MORE ABOUT NEHA (from her Physical Therapist):Neha is a 13 year-old girl who has a degenerative mitochondrial disease where she is deficient in POLG, a part of her genome. When I started working as Neha’s physical therapist four years ago, we would walk down the block together.  I stood close by to make sure she wouldn’t fall, but together we walked. Today Neha is confined to a chair, unable to sit up alone, and her voice barely rises above a whisper as she does not have the strength to project loudly. Neha’s family is one of strength and kindness. No matter how hard the day, her mom meets me with a smile and thanks me for coming to see her daughter. Her mother does not complain that she barely sleeps, that she’s already lost one daughter, and is watching another slip away.  Instead she worries  that she has used all her sick time to take care of Neha and now any additional days off go unpaid. Everyone in the home understands that Neha is declining, and her mom just feels saddened over lost time with her daughter.In an incomprehensible ruling, her parents’ insurance rejected both a stander and a shower/toileting chair for Neha. Her parents worked with a hospital to file all paperwork correctly and yet insurance responded they are not responsible for her toileting or standing needs. Neha now cries when her family puts her in the bath. Her mother goes into the shower with her and holds her head as they quickly try and wash her. It also takes 2 people to toilet her as there is no way to support her body and head without a specialized chair. Neha is fed through a tube that goes straight into her stomach. Almost every other week, she will now go 2-3 days without speaking, constantly grimacing due to extreme gas pains. A stander would help with her digestion. I have previously asked Neha’s parents if they would allow me to help raise funds. Proud and self-sustaining immigrants, her parents always said no, that they would manage. When they received the notice of rejection for the chair and stander, they agreed for the first time to allow a fundraiser, as time is of the essence.  Neha’s future is uncertain but together, we can help give her family the comfort she so deserves right now. Thank you so much for your help and support.",176,161,2,180,6 months,5 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

The part of the brain that supports his speech was affected by the stroke and he remained in Neuro-Intensive Care Unit for 6 days until he was able to receive enough oxygen on his own to support the rest of his brain function. He was moved to the stroke unit of the hospital where he is currently being monitored. Doctors told the family that he is extremely lucky and he continues to amaze the doctors with his drive to get better. Eventually, he will be moved to St. Charles Rehabilitation Hospital where he will be admitted for an indefinite amount of time.Many of you have called and asked how you can help. This is how. Our goal of this GoFundMe campaign is to do what we can financially to allow Greg to be able to focus on rehabilitation and not to worry about the mounting medical bills or how he will support himself or his family moving forward. Greg has a long road to recovery. As many of you know his livelihood is the CE business which requires him to travel for work on a weekly basis. However, this is not an option right now. He has overcome so many previous obstacles, such as open-heart surgery, but this will be another lengthy road to recovery in terms of weeks in the rehabilitation center and extended home care. Greg’s determination to overcome this continues to amaze everyone around him. He is still positive and thankful for his life and his spirits are up that he will win this fight. If you can contribute to help Greg, please do so. Your donation will allow Greg to focus on his difficult recovery. If you cannot contribute financially, please continue to send positive thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to him and his family.

My name is Kathlyn Carney and I am so blessed to be able to call Trish Churchill my best friend for the last 9 years. Trish and I met freshman year of high school at Archmere Academy and quickly became inseparable. Even though we both ended up at different colleges and in different cities, we have remained extremely close. Trish is currently studying at the prestigious Thomas Jefferson University’s College of Pharmacy where she is completing her Doctor of Pharmacy degree. She is one of the hardest working people that I have ever met, so it was no surprise to me when she was accepted to the Jefferson College of Pharmacy. I know I speak for so many people when I say that Trish is one of the most dedicated, resilient, selfless and kind people I have ever met. Trish always puts her friends and family first and she has taught so many of us what it means to truly care about someone. In the midst of finishing her last didactic year at Thomas Jefferson University and enjoying her favorite city, Philadelphia, Trish received unexpected news. At the end of February, Trish was diagnosed with the rare autoimmune disease Myasthenia Gravis and more recently stage 4A Thymoma. A thymoma is a tumor that is found in about 10% of patients with Myasthenia Gravis. Trish’s tumor is currently too large to surgically remove, so she is estimated to undergo 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor; in hopes that it can be surgically removed following treatment. When Trish told me the news, I was devastated and couldn’t believe this was happening to her. However, I have never met a stronger person than my best friend and I know if anyone can get through this, it’s her. Her attitude since she found out about her recent health conditions has been incredibly admirable. She is determined to complete her final semester of academics on time and begin her final year of rotations as planned in May. Every time I talk to Trish, she is positive and encourages all of her friends and family to have the same optimistic attitude. Despite her situation, Trish has never once asked for sympathy and has continued to be the same resilient and compassionate woman that we all know and love.  By creating this page, we’d like for the Churchill family to solely focus on Trish’s healing process. It is our goal for her to receive the best possible treatment without insurance limiting the medication options available to her. Please join us in supporting Trish’s journey to a cure. All donations will be used for any medical out-of-pocket expenses that the Churchill’s will endure.

She met with Neurologist the following week who put her on a 7-day steroid and scheduled an MRI for 6/25. The steroid finally relieved the pressure and pain for the first time she first started feeling it a week so prior.  At this point, the Neurologist was not expecting to see anything abnormal on the MRI, but just scheduling for due diligence. After the 7-day steroid pack, the headaches returned. The Neurologist then prescribed a migraine medication. That only partially worked. Last week they called the Neurologist office every day seeking a consistent pain relief management strategy. The Neurologist said there was nothing more she could prescribe until after the MRI and advised if they need relief to go to the ER so they returned to the ER last Thursday night. Megan received an IV with a steroid where for the second time she finally had relief from the pain. She was discharged that night, but once the steroid subsided, the pain returned. They scheduled an MRI for yesterday at 6:30 AM dressed in their work attire, not expecting to find abnormal results. But the results unfortunately showed a sizable malignant tumor in her right brain, bigger than a golf ball, pressing on her brain stem and pushing into her left brain. This was the reason for the constant pressure and headaches. She was immediately admitted back to ER and surgery scheduled for Thursday to remove the tumor. The Neuro Surgeon explained that the cancer is not curable with surgery, its just the first step.  After surgery, she will start treatment.Please consider donating to help show your support and love for these two IG family members. We will be arranging for meals and other supportive activities to help them through this difficult time and to help Megan win this fight. Help spread the word!",475,622,0,473,2 months,2 months ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Hello everyone! 

My name is Ai Sonomura. I have been a good friend of both Megumi and Hiroyasu Nunokawa since high school in Chiba Japan.  Former residents of Utah, work opportunities took them to Indiana about three years ago.  They have five children ranging in age from 18, with plans to head off to college in the fall, to 5.  Over the years I have seen how much they have extended themselves to others, opening up their home, resources and hearts, helping freely and unconditionally.    

They have recently learned of a serious medical condition afflicting Megumi that will significantly impact their family's lifestyle and livelihood for the foreseeable future.  Hiro provides for the family, but they are not wealthy by any means, as Megumi has juggled raising the kids and finding ways to bring in additional income. 

I am copying a portion of her own explanation of the situation from a Facebook post, so please read below to understand the more in-depth details. However, I truly believe it is time they become the recipients of some good will in this uncertain and challenging time for them.  Many who are aware of their recent circumstances have asked how they could best assist, including being willing to send money, which is how we collectively decided this would be the most effective and convenient way to help them at this time.

 

Hi, Families and Friends!Some people might be curious about my situation so I will share a brief of it !I am hospitalized now because they found tumors in my heart and between the heart and lungs. The one in my heart is about 5 cm and the other is 3 cm and tangled in some tubes that connect the heart and lungs, making it hard to breathe, but I'm surviving for now.I am so blessed to have great doctors to take care of this severe issue and they are trying to figure out the best treatments for me. There were some options, like open heart surgery or chemo therapy . Since this is a really rare case, the doctors are discussing from every angle every day.  And for now, chemo looks like the best option to try. (UPDATE: Doctors have been determined that surgery is not possible. They are pending various test results to determine when and how to proceed with the chemotherapy).It might seem like a huge trial, but I have already received so many blessings through this experience! 1️⃣ I am feeling that I have THE BEST family and friends and they love me soooooooo much!(Hiro stays with me all the time. Mia takes care of the other kids and so many families and friends are supporting us) 2️⃣ I am in the right place to receive great treatment!Please include my name in your prayers.  That would be extremely powerful help for me!I love you all  ❤️I will try to update when possible as long as I am able to hold my phone !

布川夫婦は、5人の子供を育てる中で、どんなに忙しくても、困っている方がいるとすぐに助けに行くような、奉仕の人たちです。

個人的にお知らせが難しいので、こちらから少しだけ現状報告を！

ただ今入院中でして、その理由は心臓の中に5センチ大、肺と心臓の外側に3センチ大の腫瘍が見つかり、多分リンパ腫ではないかと。外側にある腫瘍が心臓と肺をつなぐパイプに絡みつき圧迫しているせいで、呼吸が苦しいですがちゃんと生きています。恵まれた事に素晴らしいドクター達のチームが私のために毎日検査と話合いを色んな角度からしてくれて、最も良い治療法を模索してくれています。 あまりにレアなケースなだけに、開胸手術か抗がん剤治療かで意見が二転三転しましたが、今のところは抗がん剤治療の可能性が高いようです。一見、厳しい試練のように見えますが、それでもすでに沢山の溢れる祝福を受けています。

1️⃣ 私には最高の家族と友達がいて、ものすごく愛されていること。（ひろくんは常に私と居てくれて身の回りのことをしてくれます。美愛は自宅で子供達を家事をしてくれています。沢山の素晴らしい友達が毎日色んなサポートをしてくれています）2️⃣凄腕のドクターたちのチームが見てくれている事（一人のドクターから、もし僕があなたの状況ならこのチームで診てもらいたいと言われました）

私には信じる宗教があり、信仰に寄って生きる者なので、どうぞ、どんな形でも言葉でもいいで、私のためにお祈りしてくださいね。お祈りの偉大な力を知ってます。皆さん一人一人が大好きです❤️携帯を持てる限り、また報告します！",279,1.1k,5,283,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We were told that without immediate treatment he would live only a couple months. April 11th he was admitted to the hospital for anywhere between 30-40 days, until complete remission occurs. At that time he will be allowed home for only a short time, before he will undergo a bone marrow transplant, followed by another 3 months in a secluded living space near the hospital.It goes without saying that this news has thrown our worlds into a complete tailspin. It has been devastating, scary, confusing, and it's all happened so incredibly fast. No one has had much time to really think about the financial crisis this is going to be for Brad and Cindy. Truth is, not very many people could live for 5-6 months on less than 1/2 their income plus a medical bill that is inestimatable. My whole life my parents have stretched slightly beyond their means, relying on faith and frugality, to continually provide me and my brothers opportunities that allowed us to become the people we are today. We are forever indebted to them, and because of this; and like many of you, we want to do whatever we can do within our control to be there for them when life gets really, really  hard. That time has very unexpectedly come, and we want to ask something very big of all of you. Some have known my parents since they were born, some met them when you were all young kids, some are relatives both near and far, co-workers, acquaintances, some of you are my friends, or Luke and Josh's friends. So many people have shown such support, and asked how they can help, we are truly blessed by the company we keep. We cannot say thank you enough for the sincerity we have felt.Can we come together financially to support two of the most humbled-hearted, compassionate, generous, loving, and most genuine people we have ever come to know? What we can say we know for sure is that cancer is awful, and it really can strike anyone at anytime. It is REALLY unfair, and it has the power to destroy a person and their family in more ways than one. You never think it will happen to you, but then one day you wake up and it's all you think about. We are all forever even more compassionate and ready to help others in our situation than ever before. We did a little math, and if we can find 200 people who would be willing to donate $100 dollars each, we can help my parents pay the medical side of this beast. They would be blown away, and it would offer them reprieve from the daily stress and allow them to focus on my dad beating leukemia. Whatever your finances may allow you to afford, we come full of gratitude to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",137,253,5,139,4 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN. - Leonard CohenIf I could go back in time and shake the Cecily who cried every time her heart got broken by some frat boy, or comedian or writer of bad movies (sorry ex boyfriends) - I would. I'd say, ""You think your heart is broken now? Cut to 15 years in the future, when a cardiologist will tell you - No….it's really, really broken."" Last month, I was told I had a heart aneurism, which is the cause seemingly of one of my heart valves to have completely malfunctioned. Scarier, the root of my aorta is apparently crumbling and the tissue that basically holds my heart in place in my body is breaking apart. Eventually, it can burst and ya know, that's kinda it.This month, aside from having to re-build the aortic root, they have to fix the valve by most likely replacing it with another one. I'm just going to be honest…I am terrified. What has confounded this is that one of the ""helpers"" at the hospital (after my MRI) found out I live alone and kept saying, ""This is so hard, because you are so so so so alone. How WILL you DO this ALONE?"" I of course know I'm not alone. (My beloved Beagle mix just can't drive or help me with finances.) But a few nights ago, when I was writing my will and thinking ""who would even WANT my 1993 Mazda"", I felt a sense of existentialism never quite described in high school philosophy class. It feels so scary and that’s just the truth. The ""why"" of it can't be answered. I haven't eaten red meat in 10 years, I have never once smoked a cigarette, I'm not a heavy drinker. The only thing that's ever gone up my nose was probably a marble, but that was in the 70s! Aside from these fears, I'm equally terrified of the expenses about to land in my lap. I have health insurance, of course. But even insurance can't keep up with the demands of today's healthcare costs. Open heart surgery is obscene. I do know there will be a lot that's not covered by insurance. There already is. And because I'll spend time in the ICU  and re-habbing after. I won't be able to work one of the many extra jobs I do to make ends meet…for months.  So I'm trying to make myself feel better by putting it like this: I've never had a wedding or a baby. So think of all that could have been spent flying out to see me get married. Or the wedding gifts. Or the baby gifts. Since Bloomingdales won't let me register for ""Aortic Root Replacement"" or Bed, Bath and Beyond does not have a ""pig valve"" or ""aftercare"" section, think of this as a registry.In truth, I'm putting this out into the universe in hopes of easing some of the horror of this. Physically and emotionally, I feel underwater. I have no idea what my financial ""goal"" should be, but if I could just write ""life raft"" up there, I would. Even the tiniest bit of help will help and so from my crumbling heart to yours, I thank you for reading, giving or sharing.",198,584,2,192,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

It was so hard for everyone in our family and so many of our friends. As the holidays approached and we were still grieving the loss of my Dad, we got news no one could have dreamed we would hear.  Kerri was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer after a check up to address some digestive issues she was having. We were all devistated, but Kerri and Bob rose quickly.  They had a plan and quickly acted upon it as 2018 started.Kerri started chemotherapy almost immediately and has endured months of treatment, while consistently being strong and positive for herself and family. Watching her over the past few months has been a solid confirmation to me that she is beyond a doubt one of the toughest people God has placed on this earth. Her determination is phenomenal. Everything she does, her family drives her determination. My brother and their boys have also been determined – to keep Kerri and each other moving forward!After a recent scan, we learned that the cancer has grown and the chemotherapy was only marginally effective. Chemotherapy has been stopped and the option of radiation is now being explored. Kerri was refered to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where they specialize in late stage colorectal cancer. This is the BEST place in the country for her to receive treatment and she was fortunate to get an appointment.  Without a doubt – she needs to go, NOW!The CostsRight now, and the reason I am opening this page, is they need your help. This open-ended trip, as well as what lies beyond, all have an unknown price tag. It stinks that money has to be considered right now – because peace of mind is something everyone deserves. Bob and Kerri have health insurance, but it will not cover everything (co-pays, deductibles, travel, lodging and more).  The new lifestyle changes that their family has endured will be expensive.  How you can helpPlease consider hitting the “Donate Now” button on the upper right side of this page, adding a monetary gift, and giving my sister in-law some financial peace of mind.  Every dollar we raise will go directly to Kerri’s fight. It will help her and Bob cover medical expenses, additional treatments they may opt into, and make it possible for my brother Bob to be with Kerri during her treatments.I hope you're able and willing to support my family through this difficult and devastating experience.  With your help, Kerri, Bob and their boys can focus all of their energy on healing and remission.  It would be great to surpass our goal!Thank you!Thank you so much for reading my story!  Thank you for opening your heart to my family.

In February, Janelle fell outside our home on her way to class and began having pain in her lower back. After a month or so she went to the hospital to see what was wrong, as it couldn’t possibly be from falling a month prior. Doctors thought it was a bruised bone, maybe a slipped disk, or possibly a kidney infection... Come April, after spending 10 days at Mass General Hospital, undergoing multiple scans and tests, Janelle had a biopsy done revealing the pain was from cancer. She was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare bone cancer most often found in children and adolescents. When I found out it was cancer, I said to myself, “Of all people to get cancer… I am absolutely stunned it’s Janelle.” If there is a poster child for healthy living and positive energy, it would be her. Before her diagnosis, Janelle was either at the yoga studio, tearin’ up the mountains in the winter, whipping up a delicious healthy (usually vegan) meal in our kitchen, or hanging with friends at the Ski and Board house. She also spent the last two years working with the UMass Amherst based nonprofit, Protect Our Breasts, an organization that focuses on sharing the conversation about chemicals in products that contribute to cancer, and empowering women to make safer choices to protect their health. Janelle is currently the co-president of the UMass Ski and Board Club, and will be beginning her senior year online this fall.  Janelle is still on track to graduate from UMass Amherst in May 2019. As Janelle continues this long journey, she needs your help! She is currently receiving treatment and going through rounds of chemotherapy at Mass General Hospital in Boston. Her treatment is extremely rigorous, tiring, and will be ongoing for the unforeseeable future. Once she is done with chemo, she will most likely need additional treatments such as a bone marrow transplants and clinical trials.

What you may not know is the severity. Alexa, who is 15, has stage IV Osteosarcoma in her right shoulder and it has metastasized to both of her lungs. She had been experiencing increasing pain, and sudden swelling led us to take her to the emergency room for evaluation, and she was admitted for additional testing. We received the diagnosis within days. She had her first inpatient Chemotherapy on March 19th. She will continue Chemotherapy for 10 weeks. Then the results will be evaluated and she will have surgery. Lack of money stops people from having the home or car of their dreams, traveling, or pursuing their dreams or interests.

My name is Laura Boyle and I am 27 years old from Smithfield, Rhode Island. Last year I was diagnosed with Von Hippel Lindau Disease. VHL is an extremely rare genetic condition where blood vessel tumors can form in up to ten areas of the body. These tumors can be benign or cancerous. So far, VHL has affected my adrenal glands, my pancreas, and now my brain.My first tumor was discovered when I was in college, just 19 years old. Last year they found a malignant tumor on the head of my pancreas that was resting on my small intestine. Just one short, hectic week after finding this out, my life was uprooted and I was in the OR at Rhode Island Hospital, having pancreatic surgery known as the whipple procedure. A whipple procedure entails removing part of the pancreas, stomach and small intestine, as well as the gallbladder and liver duct. The entire digestive system then needs to be rerouted. After the surgery, they determined the tumor to be pancreatic cancer called a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This led them to discover that I have a cancerous genetic disease called VHL.After more testing, they also found that I currently have three brain tumors, known as hemangioblastomas that they continue to monitor. These tumors rest on the back of my brain and spine and continue to cause symptoms like nausea and migraines. Throughout recovery, maintaining a healthy weight has been most difficult. I am severely underweight and malnourished and my tumors and digestive issues make it extremely difficult to maintain a normal 27 year old lifestyle. In recent weeks, I have had to take a leave of absence from my teaching career because of my debilitating symptoms. I have the most amazing seventh grade students this year and it breaks my heart that I am no longer well enough to teach them and spend their last few weeks of this school year with them. Right now, I ask you to please help me in any way you can. I am currently struggling to manage my symptoms enough to get back to my students, my life, my wonderful fiancé and my caring family. I am finding it more and more difficult to maintain my job, my health bills, my doctor's appointments, and pay off my student loans. If you can help in any small way, it will mean more than you know! Thank you for reading my story.  I will be using any money I earn on my medical bills and maintaining my student loans while out on leave. This is an inspirational poem I found that was written by a fellow VHL warrior. I couldn't explain my situation any better than she does!“To look at me you’d never knowBut the tumors in me just grow and growNo matter what I do or sayThey just won’t go awayAt first the feelings just flowedThe time stood still, it got very coldFrom a care free teen with my whole life aheadTo a dying teen lying in a bedThat night I lay awake till dawnAnd before I knew I had a new plan drawnI realized something in the dark of nightThat I was going to win this fightThe tumors the doc had foundThe news that put my parents on the groundThey said that I was going to dieBut I wasn’t prepared to say goodbyeSo I got myself ready for warAnd promised my loved ones I’d walk out that hospital doorAnd sure enough the road was roughBut I was never willing to give upI know my war is not over yetBut one thing I’ll never forgetTo smile in troubles remember I’m blessedGod gave me this imperfectionCause he knew I could handle the stressAnd in a funny way I’m glad for that dayfor the scars and the tearsI’ve gathered through the yearsFor all these things is what makes meMy von Hippel-Lindau, My Life, and Me.”",385,711,0,374,3 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Our nephew Calvin who's nine has been diagnosed with stage 4 / group 4 / high risk rhabdomyosarcoma, with the alveolar genetic marker. This is an aggressive form of cancer and has a 20 percent cure rate if the treatments are successful.  Because of the location of the tumors (which are pressing up against major blood vessels), surgery is not permitted at this time.  Calvin will need to undergo chemo in hopes of shrinking the tumors so that surgical removal can take place. They are still waiting on the results of the bone marrow biopsy which took place at the same time his chemo port was put in. A U.S. Army veteran, our brother Chris is the sole financial provider for his wife and four kids and has not left Calvin's side since that trip to the ER.  Chris is on family leave which unfortunately means he does not get paid.  This means there is no income to cover expenses.  Expenses that sadly won't stop adding up during this difficult and life-altering situation: gas, food, utility bills, car payments, mortgage, everyday living expenses.  These are on top of any medical bills that may occur.  This past week is just the beginning to a long battle ahead...physically, emotionally and financially.  Please help Chris and Tiffany by donating.  Any amount is helpful!  Along with your donation, prayers for Calvin are appreciated.  Updates will be provided as we learn more.

FLT3). On Thursday, May 17, 2018 Steph was sent to Stanford Medical Center after results from a local blood test came back with dangerous levels of white blood cells. The tests were a result of Stephanie seeking medical attention after experiencing a recent series of issues that she had believed to be related to her Multiple Sclerosis. Severe headaches, debilitating in nature, a terrible ulcer on her tongue that made it impossible for her to eat and she even blacked out at one point. It was then that she realized this was beyond the challenges that she already dealt with and considered part of her “normal” with MS. Upon her arrival at Stanford they immediately began chemotherapy treatment and told her that she had cancer. It took a couple of days and a very painful bone marrow biopsy to reveal exactly what form of leukemia she would be battling. Given the seriousness of Stephanie’s already highly compromised immunity, the treatment plan for her is very individualized and she is being taken care of with extra care and attention.Tad has not left Stephanie’s side since she was admitted almost two weeks ago, and he plans on supporting her continually in the time ahead. Stephanie is currently undergoing induction chemotherapy with the hopes of putting the cancer into remission before undergoing a bone marrow transplant. If, or should I say when her marrow test comes back clean of the cancer cells, she will undergo stem cell therapy and that will then have them staying in Palo Alto an additional 100 days for 24 hour care and treatment. Much is uncertain at this point, but we do know that the Rothbauer family could use the help of each and every one of us to get through this scary, unpredictable, and very expensive journey.This Go Fund Me account is being set up to go directly to the family to pay for the many costs associated with Stephanie’s current and future treatments.ABOUT STEPHANIE:To know Steph is to love her. Her vibrancy and genuine love of life is present in everything she does. Even during these difficult times. What would cripple many has only displayed her strengths even more. This passion is displayed in everything she is a part of. She has been a supporter of the national and local MS Foundation, she’s a well-recognized interior designer (which class studies she completed in the initial stages of battling her MS), she’s an amazing participant in the county Big Brothers and Big Sisters project where she was recently honored as Big Sister of 2018. Steph received this honor because like everything she commits to she has been committed to her little sister and it is a commitment that she plans to see through the young lady’s time in school and beyond. Steph’s family is her biggest passion and her focus is and always has been to ensure that TJ (age 14), Brayden (age 12), and Mia (age 8) are happy, loved and know their place in her heart. The battle ahead is not going to be easy and the only option is that she comes out the champion, but Steph and her family are going to need all of our support facing this future of uncertainty. For a woman that lives by a plan and a calendar you can imagine the strain and fear that she is feeling and yet she does so with smiles, jokes and making the rest of us still better for being a part of her life. Let’s help where we can and take whatever burden away so that her and her family’s focus can be on her recovery and time together that is and always will be a priceless amenity.WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR:Although Stephanie and Tad have medical insurance through his employer, there are many, many costs that are not covered through insurance. Your generous donations will go towards helping pay for a variety of costs associated with Stephanie’s treatment including:- Co-pays for medications and treatmentsMany of the treatments that Stephanie is and will be receiving are VERY expensive and insurance does not always cover everything. - Gas, hotel rooms and restaurant foodStephanie is currently being treated at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, CA, a 4 hour drive north from her family’s home in Paso Robles. Her future treatments and potential bone marrow transplant will also be at least a few hours from her home. Your contributions will go directly towards covering the many ancillary costs associated with a family of five living away from home for an extended period of time.WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:In addition to donating, you can help us spread the word!

At that very moment this 31-year-old man's life would change forever; he was suffering a stroke. He displayed all the classic signs, dropping face, tingling on one side of his body, slurred speech and total confusion. He was taken to the emergency room where the diagnosis confirmed that Tim did suffer from a ""mini"" stroke. He stayed overnight in the hospital and after further observation he was released the next day with instructions to return for further evaluation. Shortly after his release, while walking his dogs with his girlfriend, Tasmyn, Tim once again was suffering from another stroke, this time his condition was much more severe.Test after test, Neurologist were baffled and could not pinpoint a definitive diagnosis. After much research the experts saw traits in Tim's condition and tentatively concluded that he may have a disease called Moyamoya. This disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder caused by blocked arteries at the base of the brain. This was a first for Neurologist at the Kaiser Permanente of San Diego, so they were perplexed in how to treat it. During that time, Tim had worsened even more. To the point where he could no longer speak, had lost his ability to move his right arm and became very lethargic. Initially, doctors began a regiment of blended medications in hopes it would stabilize him. Unfortunately, the medication was not working so the ultimate and last resort was for the Neurologist to perform an angioplasty to the area of Tim's brain that was not getting enough blood flow.With the grace of God and the many prayers offered up for Tim, the procedure was successful. The doctors were able to open up the vessel and to get blood flowing back into the affected area of Tim's brain. After spending one week in the Direct Observation Unit and another week in the ICU, Tim was transferred to a Rehabilitation Center where he will have to relearn how to speak, walk and do many of the basic functions of everyday life that he was doing prior to his stroke.Tim's journey is long, but he is resilient and determined to get back to some type of normality. As you can imagine the cost of his stay in the hospital, the surgery, the treatment plan, the medications and all the other expenses you can think of will be another challenge for him to overcome.To our friends, family and anyone reading this message, your donation to assist Tim in tackling this debt will be greatly appreciated. We are humbled and words or actions could never repay your kindness and generosity.  However, if you are not able to make a monetary donation, please keep Tim in your thoughts and prayers.

At this point, the only treatment available is chemotherapy. If she responds well and if cancer has not spread, she might be able to have surgery after several rounds of chemo, but the doctor suspects there are a few cancer spots on the liver too. We all know Kika, she is in severe pain, but always in a great mood and is enduring all the tests exceptionally well. Housing SituationKika's house was severely damaged during the hurricane last year. There was significant flooding, and she lost almost all the renovations she had done to the house a few months before, including a brand new kitchen and flooring. She has been fighting with the insurance and just now got the approval to fix the house (although she did not get all the money she was asking for). She will start renovations soon and will try to sell the house as soon as it is done. Currently, her home has no kitchen, no living room, no washer/dryer and only one functioning bathroom. That was ""fine"" until she was diagnosed with cancer. Now she cannot stay there anymore, nor she can deal with the remodeling herself (to save money she was going to supervise it). We plan to rent her a small apartment, preferably near her son and his family immediately, since she will start chemo on July 13th. In the meanwhile and whenever she wants, she will stay at my house. She knows she is always welcome here (we set up a bedroom for her) and I will do everything I can to be with her at every medical appointment and treatment, but I know she would like to have her own place and be close to her grandson. By the way, Kika's son and his family live in a two-bedroom condo, so there is no space to accommodate Kika and her beloved dogs comfortably.Work and IncomeWork-wise; the situation is even tougher. Kika always worked as an independent contractor but has no new projects (nor she can take new projects right now.) So, she will have no income at all, but a very small retirement check.Health Insurance and Medical ExpensesHer health insurance is Medicare, and she will have several out of pocket expenses. We also would like to get a second opinion from MD Anderson or John Hopkins in Maryland and to join medical trials around the U.S. that offer hope. This gofundme campaign is to help us get through the next few months until her house is sold. She plans to use the house money to pay for her future expenses. Unfortunately, we cannot wait until she sells the house and, with no new project/work, she cannot afford to rent an apartment or pay for her mortgage, treatment, and medication. I know Kika has some great friends out there and that you all will help her through this. Any amount is highly appreciated. I plan to post a few updates here, but if you would like to contact Kika and/or myself directly, please email TeamWinKika@gmail.com. We both have access to that email so that I can send updates in her behalf. Thank you all so very much.",163,619,6,165,2 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is precious and dear to so many as a wife, mother, daughter, sister, grandmother, mother-in-law, aunt, sister-in-law, friend and so much more.In February 2018, Mrs. Tammy was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She had surgery on March 15th to remove part of her pancreas. At that point, the cancer had not metastasized and we were believing for a surgical cure. After Mrs. Tammy recovered from surgery, she began chemotherapy.  On August 8th, she had a CT scan done to see if the chemo was working. Unfortunately, the chemo is not working and there are now multiple tumors in her abdomen.Through much research and many phone calls to oncologists, medical centers and the top hospitals all over the country, Mrs. Tammy has found New Hope Medical Center. Their central office is in Arizona, and their treatment hospital is in Mexico. They offer a 12 day cancer treatment. This treatment is her next best option for a cure. Through much prayer and faith, Mr. Tim and Mrs. Tammy have concluded that this is her best option and the door that God is opening. Fortunately, they allow one person to go with her and stay with her for the duration of the treatment. Because of the aggression of the cancer, we are hopeful Mrs. Tammy gets approved to go next week (August 20th).  Our goal is to raise $35,000  to completely cover the cost of the 12 day treatment and travel to get there.  If you feel so led to give, we thank you so much! Please also join us in prayer for healing, peace, wisdom and for God's will to be done. Join us in the fight on the journey to Mrs. Tammy's recovery!A note from Tim and Tammy: ""Thank you for joining us in this fight. We are so humbled by all of your love, prayers and any financial support you can offer. God bless you!""The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.

At this point, insurance has not approved to cover the required shots for her treatment.  Her family plans to proceed with or without their approval to ensure she receives the needed treatment to get her back to normal.Darice has been by her side while Daddy Louis has been home taking care of her two sisters, 'Ihilani and Kolokea.  Peka has a huge support base from her family, friends and church family.  Her faith in God is strong and we believe that God has his hands on her and she will be his walking testimony to share his miracle healing upon her.  While prayers are what she needs the most, medical bills are starting to come in and as much as her family hates asking for help, there have been so many people reaching out wanting to help financially so they have decided to start this page to aslo keep everyone updated on her progress.  We Love you all and thank every one of you for your love and prayers.Peka and the Garcia OhanaPeka can do all things thru Christ who strenghthens her.  Phillipians 4:13",275,1.7k,19,276,2 months,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,60,Advanced Cancer Therapy Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/advanced-cancer-therapy-treatment,"DALLAS, TX","May 30, 2018","$85,000","$31,110","A final chance to liveHello there. My name is John Bacile and I’m a Christian father of 4, and a stage 4 cancer patient with only a few months left to live (Again.)I know that some of you reading this may have also heard these words from your doctor, and if you haven’t, I can tell you, it is sobering. Your entire world comes to a stop. By the time I discovered I had bladder cancer 2 and a half years ago, it wasalmost too late. I had a very aggressive, invasive cancer that had already eaten into the muscle wall of my bladder.My options were so stark, so quickly, that I could barely breathe. I was told that unless I had a Cystectomy (surgery to remove the bladder and other nearby organs that are affected) and take Chemotherapy and Radiation for 3-6 months, I would probably only live 12 months and suffer a painful death as the cancer was obviously progressing in an unfavorable area. Even if I elected to allow the surgery, the cancer may have already grown past the point of being eradicated.I really wasn't given other choices and the Oncologists wanted to begin their operations, chemo and radiation within 2 weeks. But I consider myself fortunate that my first instinct was to pray. Seemingly out of nowhere, I remembered a book I had read the year before that discussed holistic therapies for cancer patients and it recommended ingesting overwhelming clean and raw nutrition in large doses in order to rebuild your immune system's natural weapons against disease.So I politely refused the doctor’s advice since having come to believe that destroying my immune system with chemicals and poison would greatly affect my odds of living a quality life in the few months I had left with my family. Instead, I decided to go on an all-natural, holistic, organic diet - juicing, raw organic foods, steamed vegetables, lean meats and various supplements, vitamins and enzymes, etc.That was February 2016 and we acted immediately with no hesitation. However, because the cancer was so aggresive by June it had begun to cut off urination and so I elected to have a secondary surgery called a TURP where they go in and cut out as much of the tumor as possible. The pain and the constriction were immediately relieved, but not for long. By August, I needed another operation, and by December, a third.By the time of that operation 11 months had passed and the tumor had now merged so much with my bladder that it was increasingly difficult to tell them apart in key areas like the ureters where urine drains from the kidneys to the bladder. I remember that disappointing day when I was informed that the doctors could perform no more operations; the cancer would only grow from here.The day after the December 2016 operation, my kidneys began to fail. The next morning, I needed an emergency Nephrostomy (where tubes are inserted into your kidneys through your back to drain them.)I remember being very discouraged that day as I lay in my hospital bed. Tubes in the front of me, and bags and tubes on my sides and back; the pain of back to back operations and the dreadful thoughts in my head of how quickly I was deteriorating were overwhelming. One day in the beginning when I had initially prayed to the Lord, I heard His voice tell me, “This disease is not unto death.” It was quiet; it was deep, and I daily held on to it as I fought to beat back the cancer. “But what now?” I thought. “After all this how could I possibly be saved?” Because also in June of that year, a new breakthrough in Immunotherapy for bladder cancer had been rushed to the market by the FDA, the first such advance in over 30 years. I remember thinking about how fortunate I would be if only I could take the IV therapy. However, the FDA had approved the wonder drug only for dying patients who had exhausted all other standard options - surgery, chemo, and radiation.But remember I had turned all that down.How unfortunate, I thought, that something that could possibly save me was so close and yet so far. While I was pondering our limited options, the Oncologist informed us that because I was given the emergency Nephrostomy, I was no longer a potential Chemo patient. And as of that day, I had technically exhausted all possible cures. I was now terminal, and eligible for the immunotherapy.And just like that, I was the second person in Dallas Texas to begin taking the advanced bladder cancer drug, “TECENTRIQ.” And then like magic after only 3 months, the scans showed that I had responded wonderfully to it. All the cancer outside of my bladder had disappeared and the main tumor had shrunk over 25%. What great excitement and hope we had. It happened so quickly and was such a miracle at the very last minute. But cancer is very clever and unfortunately, after only 8 months, the drug stopped working and the next scans showed that the cancer was back and worse it was growing in many other places as well. Month after month we continued with a similar bladder Immunotherapy and always taking the nutrition program as there was nothing else to do. As the months have passed, the cancer had continued to spread to my kidney and my lymph system in my throat and groin, and the main tumor has become very large. 2 weeks ago we took new scans since an additional 8 months have passed since the last, and based on them, the oncologists have again given me only months to live. Thank you for reading this far because you won't believe what happened next. Naturally our hopes and hearts were shattered and our finances had become utterly depleted. I know this is how it is for so many people with cancer, and my heart aches for those less fortunate than myself. My story up until now is the same story so many people share. It's just a devastating disease in so many ways.I am once again faced with this fact - If I do not have a miracle very, very soon, I am going to die. This was not as frightening to me as it once was though, because we have already had so many miracles during our journey that we have simply come to expect them. It seems that whatever we needed, whenever we needed it, was always there. (But this time, I must admit, I didn’t know what else there could possibly be) Are you going through a cancer trial or any other great difficulty in your life? I want to encourage you to never give up and always, always trust the Lord. He is good and merciful. With all this despair and difficulty surrounding us, our trust in the Lord was all we had left. That was when, only two days ago, two of my customers who had heard about my cancer walked into my business and sat down. They said that they are involved on the margins in one of the world’s most exciting cutting edge scientific Immunotherapy drugs, developed at Baylor Medical College in Houston Texas. They wanted to know if I’d go to a clinic in India to take treatment.And again, seemingly out of nowhere, just hours after I had been on the verge of accepting my imminent demise, my fatalism has turned into hope. For me, this is not a trial. The drug has been proven to work and is not just for bladder cancer; it has already completed a remarkable trial and it works for all solid tumor cancers.There I was, as you can imagine, stunned, speechless, and light as a feather as another timely miracle was laid at my feet.  But in order to take advantage of it I will need a lot of financial help. That's where you come in and I need your help as fast as possible - timing is essential - I must leave soon and begin the treatment that could well save me from this aggressive cancer.Having to act so quickly, we cannot take the time to first raise the funds, so we are leaving June 3rd on faith and well-placed hope because this treatment has been proven to work favorably on 40% of the first group who had been given treatment. And now the door has been opened for us to go. The cost of the medicine and travel expenses is in the neighborhood of $85,000/95,000 - and the initial part needs to be raised fairly quickly.Fighting this disease for 3 years now, has left us with virtually no money in order to take advantage of the treatment being offered to us. From a brief email this week sent to a few of our family and friends - an initial amount of cash was raised to begin the process and secure a deposit in order to be accepted into treatment.However, none of the estimated $85,000 plus is covered by insurance so we are needing to turn to the mercy and grace of anyone wishing to help. Even if you cannot help us financially, please sign up for our blog and follow our experiences as you or someone you may know could easily need this therapy in the future – hopefully as it gets less and less expensive.This is what we can share with you as of now:-            We are asking that you donate any cash amount you can via Go Fund Me. We are also asking that you donate any excess Frequent Flier points as we can use these points by giving miles in exchange for cash. -            From our initial email above, we additionally received donations from several people of over 600,000 Frequent Flyer miles. With a portion of these, we were able to purchase 3 roundtrip airfares as my two sons Kelly 19 and David 28 will be going with me. (David will only stay for 3 weeks)Here is our Itinerary:-          June 3rd through June 6th we fly from Dallas to NY to London to New Delhi India. (There were direct flights but I'm so easily fatigued we needed to factor in a couple of rest nights)-           My first injection will be June 20th. -           Second injection will be July 3rd, and the third and final injection will be July 17th.-           By the 2nd injection, I should begin to see reduction in tumor sizes. By the 3rd injection, my cancers will be a fraction of their original sizes. By August 1st, I should be in full remission. What a glorious day that will be!-          HOW DOES THE TREATMENT WORK-          The treatment is a dendritic cell immunotherapy.-           The technique is absolute cutting edge state of the art.-          It was developed at Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas-          Cancer tissue is taken from the main tumor, and then the DNA of the patient’s white blood cells are altered to attack that specific cancer.-          It works on all solid cancers.-          Tests to date show the treatment to be extraordinarily effective.  The treatment has no side effects and results begin immediately.-          The treatment has not yet been approved in the U.S. but has been approved in India, that's why I am going there to receive the treatment.-          However, the very first United States trial will be at Baylor College of Medicine starting late next month on pancreatic cancer.  The treatment I will be receiving in India is a very similar treatment being given to the pancreatic patients here in the first American trial.I'm so excited!-          Because after looking at my 3-year medical history, my immune system, and estimated time left to live - the scientists believe that I have an excellent probability of having no discernable tumors by the end of August.-            I thank you all in advance for helping me and my family. Without help from people like you there would be no hope for us. You are our only hope.God bless you all so very much,And thank you.

Medical,60,Ella vs. Childhood Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/5934djk,"JOHNSTON, RI","March 10, 2018","$25,000","$31,050","One day a little girl is placed in your arms.One day that little girl says her first word.One day she takes her first steps, and before you know it...One day she is off to kindergarten.Then, one day, life changes.Ella is a beautiful 6 year old. She sings and dances like it’s her job. She spends countless summer days playing at the beach, and school year afternoons with friends, family, or belting out her favorite songs like Moana’s “How Far I’ll Go.” She knows that she wants to be a singer or a princess, (or maybe even both), one day when she grows up. Ella has won the praise and acknowledgement of her teachers for being a conscientious and courteous student and an amazing friend and classmate. On Monday, February 12, 2018, Ella stayed home from school with a rash her mom, Tracy, believed to be Fifths Disease. While on the way to the pediatrician’s office for a quick check to be sure, Ella’s dad, Mike, noticed a strange lump on her lower left back. Because Ella and Tracy had attended a roller skating party 3 days prior to this visit, the pediatrician diagnosed the non-painful lump as a muscle spasm, along with her confirmation that Ella had Fifths Disease. When the lump did not change two days later, Tracy contacted the pediatrician, asking for further exploration of its cause. The pediatrician agreed, and Tracy set an appointment for an ultrasound at Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, RI for 4pm on Friday, February 16. By 4:15pm on the day of the ultrasound, Tracy, Mike, and Ella were being ushered to the Emergency Room at Hasbro for further testing on what the doctors determined was a soft tissue lump. From there...that day, and the ones that immediately followed... everything became a blur. Encouraging test results came back one by one, giving the family hope, until the MRI displayed every family’s worst fear; Ella has Ewing’s Sarcoma. Through this process, a family learns a lot. They learn to take their train that until now, had encountered the same bumps and turbulence most families experience, and switch it to a track of uncertainty. A track that is often plagued with long waits and dark tunnels, much like a roller coaster at Disney World, Ella’s favorite place to visit. Parents learn to say, “My daughter has cancer,” and only cry on those days when they wonder why, and they tell people how they’ve learned that Childhood Cancer Research is devastatingly underfunded. They learn how to tell their daughter that she will lose her hair, and that she won’t be able to regularly attend school where all of her friends continue their routine. They learn how to research and explain medical procedures, while fielding questions and giving care to their child. Family members and friends learn to ask, “What can I do,” or “What do you need” before even saying “Hello.”Most importantly, a 6 year old girl learns that even though she doesn’t feel sick, there is a thing in her body called a tumor that the doctors removed...mostly...but that some sneaky cells hung around to try to make more mischief. She learns where her chemo port is, and that the awesome nurses and doctors at Hasbro treat her with gentle kindness even when performing physically difficult procedures. Ella learned that these cells she has need chemotherapy to go away for good. And that’s what they will do. They will go away for good, because no singing princess will stand for a devious disease blocking her way.Parents learn that, even with healthcare, there’s unpaid leave from work and travel expenses that add up. The doctors at Sloan Kettering in New York City are specialists in Ewing’s, and they have agreed to see Ella and help treat her. This will mean regular trips from Rhode Island to New York. Even with donated sick days, Tracy does not have enough sick time to get her through the eight plus months of chemo Ella will need to kick Ewing’s Sarcoma to the curb. Even after the chemo, there will be months of radiation, blood work, scans, and doctor’s visits to make sure our singing princess Ella remains on the road to recovery.Tracy, Ella, and Mike have a long way to go before their train can switch back to a more well-lit, less tumultuous track. Until then, they need our help so finances do not add extra bumps and worries to their already burdened travels. Because...One day, Ella and her family will celebrate new milestones.One day will be the last chemo treatment.One day will be the first of countless clear scans and tests.One day we will all join Ella and her family in celebrating a cure for everyone.Ella, Tracy, and Mike are forever grateful for the kindness of friends, family, and especially those who give without ever having met Ella. She promises to send you an autographed picture when she becomes a famous, singing princess.",383,1.5k,8,379,5 months,5 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

Every amount you can give is utterly appreciated to help us give our Elroi the gift of hearing (and consequently speech)! THANK YOU SO MUCH! Here’s a background into Elroi’s few years on God’s beautiful earth so far.Our Miracle baby Elroi was born on the 29th of January 2015. He was born without opened nostrils which impeded his ability to breathe, a condition the doctors termed as Bilateral Choanal Atresia. Since babies are obligatory nose breathers he was not able to compensate by breathing through his mouth. At only a few minutes old, he experienced his first of three pulmonary cardiac arrests and had to be resuscitated, and several pinches administered just so he could stay alive. It was scary as a parent to see the frail body of our supposed bundle of joy go through this life threatening experience; his color would turn pink when he cried, meaning he had sufficient oxygen in his body, to an eerie purple when his mouth was closed, which meant he was oxygen-deficient. Elroi was rushed to the major teaching hospital in Ghana called Korle Bu Teaching Hospital as a matter of urgency, where a life-saving operation of perforating the nasal cavity was performed. This was not to be the only time he would go under the knife. Elroi has had other operations since this first one, including removal of the stents, and a heart surgery at five months to close an open duct.To compound issues, Elroi was later diagnosed to be profoundly deaf in both ears which led to another diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome. This is known to occur only in 1 in every 10,000 births. It is a complex combination of medical conditions which includes Coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities (severe to profound sensoneural hearing loss in both ears)After several trials and speech therapy with two fitted hearing aids, the doctors in Ghana concluded that a cochlear implant would be the best solution in aiding him to hear.Unfortunately this procedure is not done in our homeland Ghana, hence our doctor suggested Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) in Columbus, Ohio. NCH requested to redo all the assessments to ascertain if truly our son was eligible for the Cochlear implants. This reassessment came at a cost of $6,000 which we paid in full prior to the  tests getting done. After the various evaluations were conducted it was confirmed that Elroi is indeed a candidate for a cochlear implant in order for him to have the gift of hearing. With hearing, Elroi will be able to speak as these two essential life skills are interdependent in Elroi’s case.Now..to get the cochlear implant surgery done comes with a price tag of $50,000. The Nationwide Children’s Hospital has requested payment in full before surgery can be done, and as per the Cochlear Implant Specialist we met with, the surgery needs to be done as soon as possible…the further we delay the further Elroi’s speech development is impacted negatively. A lot has been committed so far to get us to this stage and your benevolence will be greatly appreciated to give our little miracle the needed hearing required to complete his full cycle development. Any amount will be greatly appreciated.",321,1.9k,5,310,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

She has an infectious smile and loves to laugh with her family and friends. Christina also loves to eat, but because of a rare disease called Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction, she can’t. Her digestive system won’t move and absorb nutrients like it should, instead food causes a great deal of pain, nausea and retching. The doctors at Cleveland Clinic have told her she is in intestinal failure and the only hope that remains is a modified multi-visceral transplant, which means she needs a stomach, duodenum, small intestine and pancreas transplant to have hope to eat - and to live. She is currently awaiting transplant.Right now Christina is receiving all of her nutrition through a surgically placed IV line that provides the nutrition her digestive system can’t (Total Parenteral Nutrition), but without the ability to eat anything she will go into liver failure, and as she knows all too well, long-term use of surgically placed IV lines brings life-threatening infections. Please join us in praying that a transplant will happen soon.During the transplant evaluation at Cleveland Clinic Christina was told the cost would be in excess of a million dollars, and although she has insurance, there are significant amounts insurance is expected not to pay. As part of the evaluation she was counseled to begin fundraising to help cover the costs of transplant, which is why this page is being created. In addition to medical costs, Christina and her mom, who will be her primary caregiver (required for transplant), will have to stay in Cleveland awaiting transplant because Christina cannot be more than three hours away when she receives the call that a donor has been found. After transplant she will be required to stay in the area for a minimum of 3-6 months. No travel or living expenses are covered by insurance.Christina is a delightful young lady with a big smile and a heart full of dreams for the future. Will you please help her raise the funds she needs to get a transplant? Asking for help is hard, but with your help, she will move forward to being able to eat again and live a life full of hope for a bright future.You can follow Christina’s journey at christinasjourney.com.

We have known Jen for many  years through our church. She is a wife to Matt and mother to three beautiful children. Recently, Jen went to the ER for what she believed was a kidney stone. The CT not only confirmed the kidney stone, but also found a 13.5 cm mass in her liver, and two soft tissue masses. The natural doctor Jen has been working with the last year has specifically been working on her circulating cancer cells (a/k/a CTCs). All of this work has not been in vain as her cell count is now down to 2. Upon follow up, a PET scan has revealed that the cancer has spread.  The natural doc has a connection with a specialist in CA, Dr. Ahvie. Dr. Ahvie is an M.D. and graduated from Johns Hopkins. He takes very difficult cancer cases and offers targeted approaches with chemotherapy, as well as another therapy that acts as a cancer vaccine of sorts. (They still have more information to obtain.) The targeted therapy would be based on the RGCC testing that Jen did with her natural doc that outlined the exact chemo that gave her the highest death rate of cancer cells. Dr. Ahvie has been consulting with Jen’s natural doc and believes she would be a candidate for his therapy. He indicated how happy he is for the work that has been done to lower the CTC count, as it’s important to his therapy as well.This is where you come in. Jen and her family need prayer warriors to rally behind her. The specialized treatment from Dr. Ahvie in CA is not covered by Jen’s medical sharing company, so she also needs monetary funds to cover testing, traveling, procedures, etc. Upon her return from the initial treatment, Jen will need to keep up Dr. Ahvie’s protocol at home, which will involve costs as well.Please join kingdom forces with us to pray specifically for Jen and her family. And please consider giving a monetary gift for these mounting medical costs. God bless you, and please continue to follow Jen’s journey here as we give updates. We would be so grateful to have you share this on social media or email.Abbie Brigham and Mary Graves____________________________________________Prayer Requests by Jen:Please pray that I would have spiritual and physical strength, not fear the future, and trust in my Sovereign God completely. May He be glorified.Please pray for my dear husband, Matt, as he works tirelessly to provide working his full time job and extra side jobs to pay for medical expenses. Matt also faithfully serves the kids and me at home as I have not been operating at full speed.Pray for my children to trust in Christ and draw near to Him. They also serve our family so sweetly. Pray for their strength and for God to bless them.Of course, please pray for total healing and for us to have wisdom as we navigate the path the Lord has for us to walk.Please pray for God to provide for my medical expenses.Please pray for doctors to have wisdom for the best treatment.Please pray that I would be able to eat and sleep and hold my weight.

Venezuela’s runaway hyperinflation, has cut my income to less than USD $20 a month. For this same reason, my insurance only pays USD $15 for my cancer treatment.The challengesFor years, Venezuela has made international headlines for its severe food and medicine shortages. We are currently experiencing the highest inflation rates in the world and a crisis with no end in sight.Millions have fled the country, seeking refuge abroad. I chose to stay in Venezuela to care for my mother, and protect my family’s small dairy farm. Even if I find the resources to pay for treatment, the life-saving immunotherapy drugs I need aren’t available in Venezuela.

Soy madre de una niña de apenas cinco añitos, a quién mantengo con mis ingresos como ilustradora de cuentos para niños.Superar un cáncer y pagar los gastos de un tratamiento tan costoso es una proeza en cualquier país, pero en la Venezuela de hoy, sumergida en una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes en su historia, la lucha es mucho más cuesta arriba.Debido a la hiperinflación en Venezuela, la más alta del mundo, y a la aberración en los controles de cambio, mis ingresos equivalen apenas a menos de $20 dólares al mes. Mi seguro sólo cubre unos $15 dólares para gastos médicos. Enfermarse en Venezuela cuesta la vida En Venezuela, la escasez crónica de comida y medicinas cobra vidas a diario. Millones de Venezolanos se han visto obligados a abandonar el país en busca de protección y una vida digna. Decidí quedarme en mi país para cuidar de mi madre, y proteger nuestra pequeña granja familiar en Los Andes, que se ha visto amenazada por invasores.Incluso si tuviese los recursos económicos para pagar mi tratamiento, los medicamentos que necesito para la inmunoterapia que me salvaría la vida no están disponibles en Venezuela. Para recibir el tratamiento, tendría que importarlos o trasladarme a otro país, lo que podría añadir cientos de miles de dólares al costo de mi tratamiento. A nadie le gusta pedir dinero a sus amigos y familiares, pero no tengo ninguna otra opción, ya que simplemente no tengo los recursos para pagar los costos yo misma.Tengo sólo 44 años, mi mayor anhelo es proteger a mi hija Iroma y verla crecer.

He was having an amazing time riding camels and exploring - all while wearing a replica Indiana Jones hat!About two weeks in, Nathan came down with symptoms that looked like traveler's sickness. My cousins took him to see a doctor where he was hydrated and given some antibiotics. Days later, he still was not improving - in fact, he was getting worse. He was so weak that he could not even stand. My cousins took him to a hospital where he became worse and worse, until he was in a coma-like state.My mom started working with his traveler's insurance to get him back to the States for better treatment, but he was not stable enough to move that far. It was ultimately decided that he would be flown to Paris, France. Luckily, his traveler's insurance covered my mom's flight to Paris and she was there to meet him when he arrived. The French medical staff told her that he had not been properly treated while in Morocco. Nathan had a bacterial infection, was on a ventilator, was close to kidney failure, and had had at least one seizure.  His kidneys are functioning better now, but he has had another seizure. He was moved to another hospital in Paris to be treated by a specialist, but his initial diagnosis was found to be incorrect. He is still only minimally conscious and we know that the road to recovery is going to be a long one.My family is hard-working and we do not have much. While our focus is on Nathan, we cannot help but worry about how we are going to pay for his international healthcare after his traveler's insurance stops covering care. Nathan and my mom are on BadgerCare, which does not cover healthcare internationally. Nathan was very lucky to be included in my cousin's travel plans and budget and, as a hard worker himself, was able to pay for his plane ticket to Morocco with his own savings from working at the Lake Geneva Cruise Line. My mom works for hourly wages and is currently not working as she is with Nathan in France - we have no money coming in. I am a graduate student and do not have much to begin with. I am leaving to see my little brother soon, which means that I won't be working either.We need a lot of support. Your donation will help my family with...-Plane tickets-Lodging-Food-Medical expenses-To help us stay on our feet after Nathan gets better and my family has not been workingWe have already accumulated $4,200 worth of medical expenses from Nathan's care in Morocco and nearly $26,000 worth of medical expenses from Nathan's current hospital in Paris; this does not include the first hospital that he was treated at in Paris and the additional costs that build up with each passing day. While news sources are emphasizing our efforts to bring Nathan back to the United States as soon as possible, he does not have a diagnosis. Because we do not know what is causing his illness yet, we do not know if he is stable or what other complications may arise if he tries to fly right away. We do not know when he will be able to fly the distance from France to Wisconsin.  This GoFundMe will be used to address all of the above listed costs as they arise - not just the potential full cost of an air ambulance. Nathan is a smart, talented guy with the driest sense of humor and a lot of fight in him. He deserved to have the adventure of a lifetime in Morocco. We want to make sure that he can be well taken care of and surrounded by the people who love him.Thank you,Rachel Dyer*updated 5/2/2018",466,1.5k,21,462,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

A family who is filled with such love and hope during their difficult journey, that they are inspiring everyone they meet. Their baby boy needs your help today…Meet Jason Jagdeo and Marissa Naidoo-Jagdeo…loving parents of Baby Michael Anthony Jagdeo (their little Hero aka “Miracle Mikey”).    Background: On November 2nd, 2015, Jason and Marissa’s lives changed forever; their beautiful angel, Michael Anthony Jagdeo, was born. Unfortunately, his birth was so traumatic that it became life-threatening to both mommy and baby. By nothing short of a miracle, they both survived. We’ve affectionately nicknamed him our “Miracle Mikey”.Mikey was kept in NICU for 3 weeks…fighting for his life. He had suffered brain damage, so extensive that doctors predicted that he would never walk or talk; this news devastated his parents, but they never gave up hope! They have faith that Mikey will defy all odds.On his second day of life, Mikey’s seizures began … and evolved over time, into a rare form of epilepsy, West Syndrome, resulting in hundreds of daily seizures. They were told that there is no cure and coupled with Mikey’s extensive brain damage, his prognosis was extremely poor. Yet, his parents never gave up hope. Together with a team of doctors, they cycled through many different combinations of medicines until they found a regime which drastically reduced his seizures! Doctors were amazed! Another miracle! However, because of the extent of his brain damage, doctors predict that his seizures would continue to evolve over his lifetime…and now, they have begun to evolve. Although heartbroken, his parents have faith that Mikey’s healing is on the way! They embody this quote: “where there is great love…there are always miracles.” There is no doubt that because of their unwavering love, faith and devotion, Mikey will continue to defy all odds.How you can help:                                                                                              For the first time, in a long time, this beautiful family has been given some hope. The specialists have ruled out surgery as an option because Mikey’s brain damage is too widespread. They have instead recommended Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy to improve his quality of life and to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, his seizures. Since Mikey continues to defy all odds, his family believes that another miracle is in the making. To see Mikey walk, talk, run and play one day would be the greatest blessing ever.However, to avoid any untoward adverse effects as a result of Mikey’s extensive brain injury and the complex, evolving nature of his seizure disorder, this specialized treatment would have to be accessed out of country, under the careful guidance of a specialist with more than 30 years experience in treating children with seizure disorders.We would need to raise at least US$89,000.00 to make Mikey’s dream a reality. Through your kindness today, we can do this!Mikey is a little hero who bravely fights his battles every day and lights up the world with his love! He is an angel on this earth, whose eyes radiate hope and determination. He just needs a little help from you right now to get him to his breakthrough.His parents are two of the most beautiful souls you will ever meet. Despite their difficult journey, they are uplifting and inspiring everyone with their love, faith and joy! To see them in tears shatters your heart to pieces. They are blessings to others; let us bless them in return with our kindness. They wish to do everything possible for Mikey because they have faith that he will do the impossible…as he has done thus far!

Two weeks later she was in Chicago at Northwestern Hospital undergoing the removal of her uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and the omentum where tumors were found. The surgery was successful in removing everything more than 1 centimeter but we learned that there was a splattering of tiny spots of cancer scattered throughout her pelvic/abdominal area.  Her pathology report came back and after deep research and  many conversations with Gynecological Oncologists and Naturopathic Oncologists,  she and Mike faced the hard reality that the traditional route--- Surgery/High Dose Chemotherapy/ Radiation- has a very poor success rate.They were told that chemotherapy would not be curative. Chemo isn't as successful because this type of cancer has a high and rapid recurrence rate that can happen even before the body has recovered from the initial round of chemo.  This leaves patients who can't do more chemo with no treatment options to handle the recurrence.With this reality facing her, Amy and Mike, after much prayer, feel that traditional chemo is the wrong choice for her and have made the decision to seek Integrative Naturopathic treatment- that combines low dose chemo and immune boosting therapies to help her body become stronger. She and Mike will leave for a clinic near the US/Mexico border on July 19th. They expect to be at the clinic for 3 to 5 weeks and will then return with a plan she will continue at home. While the Naturopathic choice may seem bold to us at first, in reality she has made a very logical decision to reject traditional treatment. Our family is behind her decision 100% and believe that God has led her down this path for a reason. Since Amy's health insurance only covers the conventional chemo/radiation route, we are asking friends and family to help us raise money to make the financial side of this a little easier to bear so that Amy can focus on healing and strength to keep up with their two precious and energetic boys. The costs include time at the clinic, at home treatment costs, supplements, infusions, missed wages and travel.We ask you continue to pray for Mike, Amy, Evan and Andrew and for our entire family. Thanks to the power of your continued prayer, we have felt our initial devastation lift and the light of God's promises start shining through. Thank you for continuing to pray for healing, wisdom and lots of joy filled days as we embrace this detour with determination.[When you pray, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.— James 1:6]",181,1.1k,12,180,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,55,Help Nick fight Cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-nick-fight-cancer,"RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, CA","June 18, 2018","$125,000","$32,218","Hi there! My name is Atianna and I am asking you to please help save my son Nick’s life! Nick was Diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma on May 24, 2018.Help Save ‘Super Nick’! We need you!I'm a Single Mom of Three Kids.Nick is a 4 year old little boy with two siblings; Jasmine 12 and David 7. My beautiful son, Nick, is the bravest and most amazing person I have ever known  in my life. His smile hardly ever seems to leave his face. His warm and silly personality has everyone falling head over heels for him. Our nurses never seem to forget him! Nurses visit our room from all floors of the hospital just to say hello, as he leaves a lasting impression with everyone. Choc hospital has named my sweet little boy, ‘Super Nick’ because of his continuous positive spirit and endless level of courage! Our nurses made a poster ‘Super Nicks Room’ and hung it on his hospital room door for everyone to see!Our story began in the most complex and confusing way.. Nick appeared perfectly healthy without any health issues prior to dropping him off to school and rushing to work one morning. It all started as a regular day at school for Nick.. Until he jumped from a little toddler slide while playing at school and hurt his ankle. When I picked him up from school that day, we rushed to our pediatrician and then to mission hospital for an X-ray.. no breaks or fractures were found...we were sent home. Strangely, Nicks pain did not improve with each passing day and instead traveled to his hip and thigh area. With numerous visits to the doctor, including an orthopedic specialist and repeated X-rays, we were told that it was an assumed pulled muscle that should heal with some time.Nicks pain was horrific, unexplainable and worrisome. I took my 4 year old baby boy to our pediatrician a handful of times, each time asking why the pain was traveling to different areas of his legs and back.. each time we were sent home without the right answer. We were distracted by the fall and by Nicks healthy weight, appetite and demeanor. Our pediatrician decided to get some blood tests taken from Nick.. One abnormal lab led us to CHOC children’s hospital Emergency Room, where we came in contact with a very special Doctor that said she would admit us and not let us leave until she got to the bottom of this. Nicks labs were taken again and had worsened from the last ones taken. The following day Nick had an emergency MRI and Catscan done under anesthesia. Soon the sky became dark as we were given the diagnosis of Stage IV High Risk neuroblastoma cancer on May 24, 2018. My world truly turned upside down. How could my innocent child be given a 66% chance of survival from Choc and 30% survival from the cancer association?  All these numbers and statistics gave me little hope, until one day I had decided that we would fight as though we were certain that Nick was the surviving and thriving number. Currently, my son is being treated at CHOC children’s hospital in Orange, California.Over the next year and a half we have a road map set by the oncology team at CHOC that includes three phases of aggressive treatment.  Nicky will endure 2 surgeries within the first phase of treatment which includes 6 rounds of of aggressive inpatient chemotherapy, the retrieval of stem cells from Nick that will be frozen and used to ‘save him’ after intense radiation and ongoing high doses of chemo in phase two of treatment.  Phase 2 of treatment will include 6 weeks of continuous inpatient stay for three cycles with 3 to 4 week breaks in between.. and finally, a stem cell transplant (using his own stem cells) during his Immunotherapy in phase 3 of treatment to ‘save him’ from the damage that radiation and chemo will cause. There is a hope for the possibility of more advanced treatment in Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital of N.Y. that is the one and only facility to offer cancer vaccines to protect patients from reoccurring cancer after treatment.Nick will be treated with 3F8, which is Memorial Sloan Kettering's proprietary antibody against GD2. It is an experimental medication waiting to be approved by the FDA. It is made only at Memorial Sloan Kettering and other hospitals don't have access to it at this time.Also, Memorial Sloan Kettering has a clinical trial ongoing for a vaccine therapy after GD2 therapy, but it is only available on trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering, CHOC doesn’t  have access to it. Memorial Sloan Kettering treatment is different than what most other centers are using as ‘standard of care’ for this type of rare and aggressive form of cancer. We would end up living in New York  periodically for 2 -3 months each time, getting rounds of radiation and numerous rounds of immune and antibody therapies.  I have been tirelessly searching for more options.  Through outreach to many doctors and organizations, Nick has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help Nick in his battle with Neuroblastoma cancer!Phase 2  of treatment for Nick, will consist of 6 weeks inpatient of radiation and chemo at a time, then home for a short while and back again with three rotations like this. If Nick survives then phase 3 of treatment begins, which is what we look forward to, Immuno therapy. The doctors explained that Nicks risks are, infertility, deafness, becoming cross eyed, severe pain from radiation, learning disabilities, relapse of cancer, new types of cancers that can be caused by the treatment, and much more. This is all an absolute nightmare. We pray that Nick will fight this cancer and win!! We will fight this battle with him! He is the strongest, bravest, funniest, most affectionate little boy in the world! Nick loves music, it makes him feel better. He receives music therapy at CHOC to cheer him up and heal his spirit. This picture was taken during Nicks first round of chemo just a week after we were diagnosed.Excited to be home and all together for the first day! Siblings were in deep heart ache to be separated during Nicks hospital stay. We had difficulty finding help to watch David and Jasmine during Nicks first round, which was a long 3 week stay. We hoped to have two weeks home together before returning to the hospital for round two of inpatient chemo but we had two emergency trips to the hospital for infections, fevers, hives and more, that unfortunately kept us away from home for almost all of the duration of our anticipated ‘home time’ together. This has been painful for all of us. Watching Nick suffer and being split apart from one another during our hospital stays, has left each of us broken.I had to stop working as soon as Nick was diagnosed, hospital expenses and bills are piling up. I am a single mother and have no idea how I will support my family with this horrible diagnosis and time that I must and will always spend at Nicks bedside. We are in a desperate need of financial resources to help sustain treatment, alternative medications and all expenses that this crisis has brought upon our family.The cost for alternative treatment is substantial, and the need to start is urgent!

Medical,55,Willa Pauletti,https://www.gofundme.com/Support-Willa,"06803, US","July 15, 2018","$32,000","$32,201","If you've met Willa Pauletti, you know she's a feisty, fabulous three year old, an independent spirit, a wonderful middle sister and a light in this world. Unfortunately, sweet Willa is facing her biggest challenge yet. In July 2018, she was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma. She started receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital (MSK) in New York City starting July 11th.  She has since tested negative for presence of the disease in her bone marrow, an encouraging result. Willa’s doctor specializes in this disease and is walking the Pauletti family through each step of this process. Each day new tests are being done to see what treatments Willa's body will and will not tolerate, so the days are long for everyone involved. At this time, it is expected that treatment will last at least the next six-eight  months. Miss Willa is proving to be a real champ through all the poking, prodding, sometimes-scary procedures and being cooped up — not a preschooler's idea of a good time. Looking down the road, the Pauletti family is going to need lots of love and support in many forms to face this disease head on. There are a few tangible needs that will need to be taken care of right away, and many expenses the family will incur while seeking treatment for Willa in the coming months. What we've learned so far about the path ahead is that Willa's immune system is going to be fighting hard, so as she moves from the hospital to their home for her monthly chemotherapy treatments, increased and ongoing deep cleaning of the Pauletti's home, plus a hospital grade air purifier will be important. Frequent appointment trips to Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital for treatments brings the associated gas, parking, and tolls.  Heidi and Gregg have diligently stood watch at Willa's bedside for days now, and will continue to do so, taking respite at the Ronald McDonald House nearby in short bursts. So far, this has not incurred a cost, but  there is a maximum stay limitation which we anticipate meeting before treatment is complete for Willa. This campaign has been initiated to defray the cost of supporting the clean home environment Willa needs to heal and the ongoing unexpected costs of travel, childcare, lodging and equipment, the medical/ drug costs we are learning will not be covered, and other needs that the Pauletti family will have to get Willa the treatment  and care required. With time, more will become clear about how Willa's treatment plan will affect the family's lives with regard to missed work, etc. As we understand what else may be required, we will update this campaign to help offset the burden for the Pauletti's.Thank you for all your continued support and prayers for the Pauletti family. Anyone who has or knows children, knows how heart-wrenching this fight will be. Anyone who knows Heidi and Gregg Pauletti knows there are no stronger, more vigilant, more fiercely loving people to support Willa in her fight. Join us in standing behind them and showing your support as they bravely face this challenge head on.With Gratitude, Friends of The Pauletti FamilyTo learn more about Willa's journey:   https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/willapauletti",205,598,2,204,1 month,1 day ago,2 days,2018-09-03

They admitted him to the ICU where Jon has now been for a week.  Since Jon has been in the ICU, he has had multiple complications from losing a significant amount of blood, seizures and blood entering his lungs.  He was able to be off the ventilator for a short time, but was put back on the breathing machine and sedated on Sunday.  We are hopeful that his condition is finally stabilizing and soon he will turn the corner.  As of now he is still intubated and sedated.  As many of our close friends and family know, Jon has been looking for work for over a year and half now as a writer and has been applying tirelessly as well as writing freelance.  Larissa & Jon were unable to perform in the show in Madrid and have been incurring medical expenses for ICU care as well as lengthening their stay in Spain for his undetermined discharge and recovery until he is fit to fly.  These unexpected medical costs at such a vulnerable time in their lives and in another country no less have been an added stress.  Larissa has met with administration in the hospital who is billing weekly to provide continued care to Jon. Larissa and Jon have been so blessed with a large community of artists, curators, fans, friends and loved ones who have always supported their work.  We are hoping for any support, love, positive vibes and financial support, if able, from this community to lift the burden from medical bills during this difficult time.  Larissa has been dealing with all of this while in Spain and thankfully has some great friends looking out for her while she’s there as well providing meals and support.  Any help given in whatever form you see fit would be valued and appreciated.  Here is to a continued and speedy recovery for Jon.With love,Velez Family&Hilary Clark",330,484,14,363,2 months,14 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Upon the procedure, just days later, the surgery revealed 3 dark spots in which the doctor biopsied. In less than 1 week, we received Casey’s diagnosis of stage 4, Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Casey, due to severe pain and inability to swallow, has lost 33 pounds in about 6 weeks. He’s been unable to work since November 2017. The local Cancer Institute proposed their method for this aggressive deadly cancer. It involved minimal chemotheropy AND TOTAL removal of Casey's tongue. Additionally he will receive heavy radical radiation, surgical addition of a permanent lifetime airway tube and a feeding tube.  The success rate of this method is 40% and life expectancy of only 3-5yrs. After frantically researching for a treatment with a more positive outcome, Casey and his family were directed to University of Chicago Medical Center. The Oncology team, after meeting Casey, projected hope. A 6 session plan of simotanious  chemotherapy and radiation for 5 days. He will receive 6 sessions of these 5 day treatments, one week on and one week off. Casey announced he is ready to fight and undergo the intense, painful treatment to try to save his tongue and his life. The Chicago Cancer team has started fighting Casey's deadly cancer 1 week after meeting in April 2018. Casey will undergo 10-12 weeks of ""In & Out"" treatment and quite a bit of time rehab and recovery. The family is working diligently, with help from the hospital and friends, to secure living quarters while he is relocated for treatment in Chicago. Donations will help with travel, medical treatments, therapies, and living expenses. Casey may not be able to work for 9 -12 months due to the treatments and therapies to help save his life. The family is struggling to pay Casey's medical and personal expenses which have been mounting since November 2017. With faith, hope and determination to support Casey's decision, we are reaching out to our communities for immediate support for this wonderful young man.",154,1.1k,4,152,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Jessica has returned to work for the last month to preserve medical insurance for our family. This has been extremely mentally/physically taxing on her to juggle work/going to the NICU/going home to Juliana. Mike has been unable to work so he could help balance being at the NICU and taking care of important appointments for Brenden while Jessica is at work.   Each day, specialists are seeing Brenden, evaluating him and making decisions...the nature of Mike's work would make it impossible for him to be there and work simultaneously. Now, we have found out that our insurance will not cover everything that Brenden will need to go home. While some  equipment is covered, he will need back up equipment (and back up for the back ups)....and 24/7 skilled nursing at home, among other expected expenses. We also will need to move from our apartment and get a different car to best accommodate Brenden’s needs. It’s going to take awhile to get him home. He has at least another 3-4 more weeks in the NICU (if all goes well). Then, he will be going to a rehab facility where they can train us on how to best take care of him. He had a tracheostomy on 6/12/18 and is going to have a gtube/feeding tube surgery on 6/19/18. He will require a ventilator at home. We need to become experts in how to care for all of that. During this time, neither of us can work, as we need to be present and with Brenden each day to learn...the faster we are trained, the faster he can come home. We don't know how long this part will take. A summer without Mike's income, after all of these months of him being unable to work while living off of one income and so many unexpected expenses, will definitely put us into a crisis financially.Then, once he can come home, depending on when that is, Jessica may need to take some days off from work to get Brenden settled.  She has exhausted her ""CAR"" days (personal/sick in bank) and already borrowed 18 days that she needs to repay to the DOE.  She has 4 weeks left of FMLA that she could take, if needed (which would be unpaid).  


At this point, the level of care Brenden will need after he gets home and as he grows older is unknown.So many people have reached out and asked how they can help...so here is our request. If you can’t donate, we would appreciate it if you could keep Brenden in your continued thoughts and prayers.

After a lumpectomy and lymph node removal surgery in March, her pathology indicated her cancer had spread. She is currently enduring 20 rounds of chemo, which will be followed by further surgery, radiation and then 10 years of hormone therapy. (Shelby is encouraging ALL her female friends to get mammograms. Her cancer was found during her 10th annual mammogram/sonogram. Her mother, a BC survivor, was diagnosed at 41 and her aunt was diagnosed at 35. Luckily, Shelby found out that she does not carry the gene). The really good news is that Shelby’s prognosis is for a full recovery.

Unfortunately, her recent rounds of chemo have made it too difficult for her to work. She recently had no choice but to leave her job. We don’t see her being able to work again until next year.

After almost 10 years together, you can imagine that Shelby’s cancer diagnosis has been such a blow to our family. We are all fighting and amazingly, Shelby is in good spirits most of the time! But with this sudden change of events we cannot survive on just one income. It’s quite hard for me to admit, but we have to ask for help. These times have shown me that I cannot do this alone. We are so blessed to have some great people surrounding us with love, prayers and support; however we can’t make it through without further assistance.

·     Medical bills

·     Emery’s daycare tuition

·     Childcare and healthcare during Shelby 2nd surgical recovery

·     Grocery delivery


I’m hoping we can all come together some way and make a big difference. Every penny counts and we appreciate each one!

Your generosity will help ensure that Neha and her parents, along with her healthy brother, have as much quality time together as possible.  Your contributions will also help purchase critical medical equipment that Neha needs to live as dignified and as comfortable a life as possible, as the illness continues to take hold of her. Neha is a sweet, smart, and funny 13-year old girl whose body is deteriorating while her mind remains perfectly intact. Her increasingly limited mobility poses a challenge to her loving parents’ ability to serve as caretakers and the demands of her disease have introduced extreme financial stress into their lives. Neha is in immediate need of critical and costly medical equipment, the claims for which insurance has unfathomably denied.  Specifically, Neha’s care requires specialized equipment for showering and personal care (a specialized toilet seat and a “stander” device will help Neha stand in the shower).Beyond medical equipment, Neha requires care beyond what her parents can provide. Her condition requires non-stop medical attention to ensure she’s breathing, so her parents alternate between working daytime and night-time hours so that one parent can be constantly by her side. Neha’s father works days as a pharmacist and stays up all night to assist her; Neha’s mother works the night-shift at the US Postal Service, comes home and sleeps for just a few hours, then tends to her daughter throughout the day.  Your support will allow Neha’s parents to purchase medical equipment and bring on part-time professional help that will enable them to focus on enjoying the only gift that matters – precious and limited time with their beloved daughter.  How you can help:1. Please give generously to help Neha get the medical devices she requires and the quality time with her family she deserves to enhance the dignity of her life.2. Please forward this GoFundMe campaign to at least 5 people.MORE ABOUT NEHA (from her Physical Therapist):Neha is a 13 year-old girl who has a degenerative mitochondrial disease where she is deficient in POLG, a part of her genome. When I started working as Neha’s physical therapist four years ago, we would walk down the block together.  I stood close by to make sure she wouldn’t fall, but together we walked. Today Neha is confined to a chair, unable to sit up alone, and her voice barely rises above a whisper as she does not have the strength to project loudly. Neha’s family is one of strength and kindness. No matter how hard the day, her mom meets me with a smile and thanks me for coming to see her daughter. Her mother does not complain that she barely sleeps, that she’s already lost one daughter, and is watching another slip away.  Instead she worries  that she has used all her sick time to take care of Neha and now any additional days off go unpaid. Everyone in the home understands that Neha is declining, and her mom just feels saddened over lost time with her daughter.In an incomprehensible ruling, her parents’ insurance rejected both a stander and a shower/toileting chair for Neha. Her parents worked with a hospital to file all paperwork correctly and yet insurance responded they are not responsible for her toileting or standing needs. Neha now cries when her family puts her in the bath. Her mother goes into the shower with her and holds her head as they quickly try and wash her. It also takes 2 people to toilet her as there is no way to support her body and head without a specialized chair. Neha is fed through a tube that goes straight into her stomach. Almost every other week, she will now go 2-3 days without speaking, constantly grimacing due to extreme gas pains. A stander would help with her digestion. I have previously asked Neha’s parents if they would allow me to help raise funds. Proud and self-sustaining immigrants, her parents always said no, that they would manage. When they received the notice of rejection for the chair and stander, they agreed for the first time to allow a fundraiser, as time is of the essence.  Neha’s future is uncertain but together, we can help give her family the comfort she so deserves right now.

Greg has a long road to recovery. As many of you know his livelihood is the CE business which requires him to travel for work on a weekly basis. However, this is not an option right now. He has overcome so many previous obstacles, such as open-heart surgery, but this will be another lengthy road to recovery in terms of weeks in the rehabilitation center and extended home care. Greg’s determination to overcome this continues to amaze everyone around him. He is still positive and thankful for his life and his spirits are up that he will win this fight. If you can contribute to help Greg, please do so. Your donation will allow Greg to focus on his difficult recovery. If you cannot contribute financially, please continue to send positive thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to him and his family. Please share this campaign with your friends, family, and colleagues.If you would like to send a card or personal correspondence to Greg please feel free to send it to the following; Greg Keys, 9 Sunset Lane, Patchogue, NY 11772.  Thank you for considering donating to Greg’s recovery and as Greg always says, “Rock Your Day!”",139,738,8,132,2 months,21 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

My name is Kathlyn Carney and I am so blessed to be able to call Trish Churchill my best friend for the last 9 years. Trish and I met freshman year of high school at Archmere Academy and quickly became inseparable. Even though we both ended up at different colleges and in different cities, we have remained extremely close. Trish is currently studying at the prestigious Thomas Jefferson University’s College of Pharmacy where she is completing her Doctor of Pharmacy degree. She is one of the hardest working people that I have ever met, so it was no surprise to me when she was accepted to the Jefferson College of Pharmacy. I know I speak for so many people when I say that Trish is one of the most dedicated, resilient, selfless and kind people I have ever met. Trish always puts her friends and family first and she has taught so many of us what it means to truly care about someone. In the midst of finishing her last didactic year at Thomas Jefferson University and enjoying her favorite city, Philadelphia, Trish received unexpected news. At the end of February, Trish was diagnosed with the rare autoimmune disease Myasthenia Gravis and more recently stage 4A Thymoma. A thymoma is a tumor that is found in about 10% of patients with Myasthenia Gravis. Trish’s tumor is currently too large to surgically remove, so she is estimated to undergo 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor; in hopes that it can be surgically removed following treatment. When Trish told me the news, I was devastated and couldn’t believe this was happening to her. However, I have never met a stronger person than my best friend and I know if anyone can get through this, it’s her. Her attitude since she found out about her recent health conditions has been incredibly admirable. She is determined to complete her final semester of academics on time and begin her final year of rotations as planned in May. Every time I talk to Trish, she is positive and encourages all of her friends and family to have the same optimistic attitude. Despite her situation, Trish has never once asked for sympathy and has continued to be the same resilient and compassionate woman that we all know and love.  By creating this page, we’d like for the Churchill family to solely focus on Trish’s healing process. It is our goal for her to receive the best possible treatment without insurance limiting the medication options available to her. Please join us in supporting Trish’s journey to a cure. All donations will be used for any medical out-of-pocket expenses that the Churchill’s will endure. Thank you so much for your time and donation - it is greatly appreciated.",376,1.3k,2,371,5 months,20 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

She met with Neurologist the following week who put her on a 7-day steroid and scheduled an MRI for 6/25. The steroid finally relieved the pressure and pain for the first time she first started feeling it a week so prior.  At this point, the Neurologist was not expecting to see anything abnormal on the MRI, but just scheduling for due diligence. After the 7-day steroid pack, the headaches returned. The Neurologist then prescribed a migraine medication. That only partially worked. Last week they called the Neurologist office every day seeking a consistent pain relief management strategy. The Neurologist said there was nothing more she could prescribe until after the MRI and advised if they need relief to go to the ER so they returned to the ER last Thursday night. Megan received an IV with a steroid where for the second time she finally had relief from the pain. She was discharged that night, but once the steroid subsided, the pain returned. They scheduled an MRI for yesterday at 6:30 AM dressed in their work attire, not expecting to find abnormal results. But the results unfortunately showed a sizable malignant tumor in her right brain, bigger than a golf ball, pressing on her brain stem and pushing into her left brain. This was the reason for the constant pressure and headaches. She was immediately admitted back to ER and surgery scheduled for Thursday to remove the tumor. The Neuro Surgeon explained that the cancer is not curable with surgery, its just the first step.  After surgery, she will start treatment.Please consider donating to help show your support and love for these two IG family members. We will be arranging for meals and other supportive activities to help them through this difficult time and to help Megan win this fight. Help spread the word!",475,622,0,473,2 months,2 months ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Hello everyone! 

My name is Ai Sonomura. I have been a good friend of both Megumi and Hiroyasu Nunokawa since high school in Chiba Japan.  Former residents of Utah, work opportunities took them to Indiana about three years ago.  They have five children ranging in age from 18, with plans to head off to college in the fall, to 5.  Over the years I have seen how much they have extended themselves to others, opening up their home, resources and hearts, helping freely and unconditionally.    

They have recently learned of a serious medical condition afflicting Megumi that will significantly impact their family's lifestyle and livelihood for the foreseeable future.  Hiro provides for the family, but they are not wealthy by any means, as Megumi has juggled raising the kids and finding ways to bring in additional income. 

I am copying a portion of her own explanation of the situation from a Facebook post, so please read below to understand the more in-depth details. However, I truly believe it is time they become the recipients of some good will in this uncertain and challenging time for them.  Many who are aware of their recent circumstances have asked how they could best assist, including being willing to send money, which is how we collectively decided this would be the most effective and convenient way to help them at this time.

 

Hi, Families and Friends!Some people might be curious about my situation so I will share a brief of it !I am hospitalized now because they found tumors in my heart and between the heart and lungs. The one in my heart is about 5 cm and the other is 3 cm and tangled in some tubes that connect the heart and lungs, making it hard to breathe, but I'm surviving for now.I am so blessed to have great doctors to take care of this severe issue and they are trying to figure out the best treatments for me. There were some options, like open heart surgery or chemo therapy . Since this is a really rare case, the doctors are discussing from every angle every day.  And for now, chemo looks like the best option to try. (UPDATE: Doctors have been determined that surgery is not possible. They are pending various test results to determine when and how to proceed with the chemotherapy).It might seem like a huge trial, but I have already received so many blessings through this experience! 1️⃣ I am feeling that I have THE BEST family and friends and they love me soooooooo much!(Hiro stays with me all the time. Mia takes care of the other kids and so many families and friends are supporting us) 2️⃣ I am in the right place to receive great treatment!Please include my name in your prayers.  That would be extremely powerful help for me!I love you all  ❤️I will try to update when possible as long as I am able to hold my phone !

布川夫婦は、5人の子供を育てる中で、どんなに忙しくても、困っている方がいるとすぐに助けに行くような、奉仕の人たちです。

個人的にお知らせが難しいので、こちらから少しだけ現状報告を！

ただ今入院中でして、その理由は心臓の中に5センチ大、肺と心臓の外側に3センチ大の腫瘍が見つかり、多分リンパ腫ではないかと。外側にある腫瘍が心臓と肺をつなぐパイプに絡みつき圧迫しているせいで、呼吸が苦しいですがちゃんと生きています。恵まれた事に素晴らしいドクター達のチームが私のために毎日検査と話合いを色んな角度からしてくれて、最も良い治療法を模索してくれています。 あまりにレアなケースなだけに、開胸手術か抗がん剤治療かで意見が二転三転しましたが、今のところは抗がん剤治療の可能性が高いようです。一見、厳しい試練のように見えますが、それでもすでに沢山の溢れる祝福を受けています。

1️⃣ 私には最高の家族と友達がいて、ものすごく愛されていること。（ひろくんは常に私と居てくれて身の回りのことをしてくれます。美愛は自宅で子供達を家事をしてくれています。沢山の素晴らしい友達が毎日色んなサポートをしてくれています）2️⃣凄腕のドクターたちのチームが見てくれている事（一人のドクターから、もし僕があなたの状況ならこのチームで診てもらいたいと言われました）

私には信じる宗教があり、信仰に寄って生きる者なので、どうぞ、どんな形でも言葉でもいいで、私のためにお祈りしてくださいね。お祈りの偉大な力を知ってます。皆さん一人一人が大好きです❤️携帯を持てる限り、また報告します！",279,1.1k,5,283,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We were told that without immediate treatment he would live only a couple months. April 11th he was admitted to the hospital for anywhere between 30-40 days, until complete remission occurs. At that time he will be allowed home for only a short time, before he will undergo a bone marrow transplant, followed by another 3 months in a secluded living space near the hospital.It goes without saying that this news has thrown our worlds into a complete tailspin. It has been devastating, scary, confusing, and it's all happened so incredibly fast. No one has had much time to really think about the financial crisis this is going to be for Brad and Cindy. Truth is, not very many people could live for 5-6 months on less than 1/2 their income plus a medical bill that is inestimatable. My whole life my parents have stretched slightly beyond their means, relying on faith and frugality, to continually provide me and my brothers opportunities that allowed us to become the people we are today. We are forever indebted to them, and because of this; and like many of you, we want to do whatever we can do within our control to be there for them when life gets really, really  hard. That time has very unexpectedly come, and we want to ask something very big of all of you. Some have known my parents since they were born, some met them when you were all young kids, some are relatives both near and far, co-workers, acquaintances, some of you are my friends, or Luke and Josh's friends. So many people have shown such support, and asked how they can help, we are truly blessed by the company we keep. We cannot say thank you enough for the sincerity we have felt.Can we come together financially to support two of the most humbled-hearted, compassionate, generous, loving, and most genuine people we have ever come to know? What we can say we know for sure is that cancer is awful, and it really can strike anyone at anytime. It is REALLY unfair, and it has the power to destroy a person and their family in more ways than one. You never think it will happen to you, but then one day you wake up and it's all you think about. We are all forever even more compassionate and ready to help others in our situation than ever before. We did a little math, and if we can find 200 people who would be willing to donate $100 dollars each, we can help my parents pay the medical side of this beast. They would be blown away, and it would offer them reprieve from the daily stress and allow them to focus on my dad beating leukemia. Whatever your finances may allow you to afford, we come full of gratitude to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",137,253,5,139,4 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN. - Leonard CohenIf I could go back in time and shake the Cecily who cried every time her heart got broken by some frat boy, or comedian or writer of bad movies (sorry ex boyfriends) - I would. I'd say, ""You think your heart is broken now? Cut to 15 years in the future, when a cardiologist will tell you - No….it's really, really broken."" Last month, I was told I had a heart aneurism, which is the cause seemingly of one of my heart valves to have completely malfunctioned. Scarier, the root of my aorta is apparently crumbling and the tissue that basically holds my heart in place in my body is breaking apart. Eventually, it can burst and ya know, that's kinda it.This month, aside from having to re-build the aortic root, they have to fix the valve by most likely replacing it with another one. I'm just going to be honest…I am terrified. What has confounded this is that one of the ""helpers"" at the hospital (after my MRI) found out I live alone and kept saying, ""This is so hard, because you are so so so so alone. How WILL you DO this ALONE?"" I of course know I'm not alone. (My beloved Beagle mix just can't drive or help me with finances.) But a few nights ago, when I was writing my will and thinking ""who would even WANT my 1993 Mazda"", I felt a sense of existentialism never quite described in high school philosophy class. It feels so scary and that’s just the truth. The ""why"" of it can't be answered. I haven't eaten red meat in 10 years, I have never once smoked a cigarette, I'm not a heavy drinker. The only thing that's ever gone up my nose was probably a marble, but that was in the 70s! Aside from these fears, I'm equally terrified of the expenses about to land in my lap. I have health insurance, of course. But even insurance can't keep up with the demands of today's healthcare costs. Open heart surgery is obscene. I do know there will be a lot that's not covered by insurance. There already is. And because I'll spend time in the ICU  and re-habbing after. I won't be able to work one of the many extra jobs I do to make ends meet…for months.  So I'm trying to make myself feel better by putting it like this: I've never had a wedding or a baby. So think of all that could have been spent flying out to see me get married. Or the wedding gifts. Or the baby gifts. Since Bloomingdales won't let me register for ""Aortic Root Replacement"" or Bed, Bath and Beyond does not have a ""pig valve"" or ""aftercare"" section, think of this as a registry.In truth, I'm putting this out into the universe in hopes of easing some of the horror of this. Physically and emotionally, I feel underwater. I have no idea what my financial ""goal"" should be, but if I could just write ""life raft"" up there, I would. Even the tiniest bit of help will help and so from my crumbling heart to yours, I thank you for reading, giving or sharing.",198,584,2,192,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

They were t-boned on the driver’s side, causing significant damage to the vehicle. Emergency responders had to cut both Jordan and Lillian from the vehicle using special equipment. They were flown out to separate hospitals as a trauma. Lillian was flown to Children’s Hospital and although is bruised and sore, has been medically cleared! Her guardian angel certainly was looking over her.Jordan was flown to Washington Hospital Center, endured multiple traumatic injuries, and is currently in critical condition. The first few hours consisted of repairing an aorta tear and stabilizing her blood pressure and heart rate. Over 1,200 images have been obtained, demonstrating the thorough evaluation by the specialists at Washington Hospital Center as they evaluate her body millimeter by millimeter.  Jordan has stretched ligaments in her neck and an injured blood vessel, which with time, will heal on its own. She has a hole in her diaphragm, which is scheduled to be repaired on Wednesday, May 2nd. She has a tube in her left lung and is having a tube placed in her right lung on Wednesday, May 2nd. She has broken ribs and has multiple fractures in her pelvis in both the front and back. She is scheduled to have pelvic surgery on Thursday, May 3rd. She has a bruised kidney and they are beginning to feel a pulse in her leg. Doctors remain optimistic and are so proud of her improvement and stability.Jordan has endured the most traumatic injuries, and although intubated, her vibrant personality has never left. She is awake, and can write but does not remember the accident. Jordan has a long road of recovery ahead of her. There has been an out-pour of positive thoughts and lots of prayers. Your thoughts, prayers and generous contributions allow Dustin, her husband to be with Jordan and Lillian as Jordan embarks on a long recovery.

We were told that without immediate treatment he would live only a couple months. April 11th he was admitted to the hospital for anywhere between 30-40 days, until complete remission occurs. At that time he will be allowed home for only a short time, before he will undergo a bone marrow transplant, followed by another 3 months in a secluded living space near the hospital.It goes without saying that this news has thrown our worlds into a complete tailspin. It has been devastating, scary, confusing, and it's all happened so incredibly fast. No one has had much time to really think about the financial crisis this is going to be for Brad and Cindy. Truth is, not very many people could live for 5-6 months on less than 1/2 their income plus a medical bill that is inestimatable. My whole life my parents have stretched slightly beyond their means, relying on faith and frugality, to continually provide me and my brothers opportunities that allowed us to become the people we are today. We are forever indebted to them, and because of this; and like many of you, we want to do whatever we can do within our control to be there for them when life gets really, really  hard. That time has very unexpectedly come, and we want to ask something very big of all of you. Some have known my parents since they were born, some met them when you were all young kids, some are relatives both near and far, co-workers, acquaintances, some of you are my friends, or Luke and Josh's friends. So many people have shown such support, and asked how they can help, we are truly blessed by the company we keep. We cannot say thank you enough for the sincerity we have felt.Can we come together financially to support two of the most humbled-hearted, compassionate, generous, loving, and most genuine people we have ever come to know? What we can say we know for sure is that cancer is awful, and it really can strike anyone at anytime. It is REALLY unfair, and it has the power to destroy a person and their family in more ways than one. You never think it will happen to you, but then one day you wake up and it's all you think about. We are all forever even more compassionate and ready to help others in our situation than ever before. We did a little math, and if we can find 200 people who would be willing to donate $100 dollars each, we can help my parents pay the medical side of this beast. They would be blown away, and it would offer them reprieve from the daily stress and allow them to focus on my dad beating leukemia. Whatever your finances may allow you to afford, we come full of gratitude to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",137,253,5,139,4 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN. - Leonard CohenIf I could go back in time and shake the Cecily who cried every time her heart got broken by some frat boy, or comedian or writer of bad movies (sorry ex boyfriends) - I would. I'd say, ""You think your heart is broken now? Cut to 15 years in the future, when a cardiologist will tell you - No….it's really, really broken."" Last month, I was told I had a heart aneurism, which is the cause seemingly of one of my heart valves to have completely malfunctioned. Scarier, the root of my aorta is apparently crumbling and the tissue that basically holds my heart in place in my body is breaking apart. Eventually, it can burst and ya know, that's kinda it.This month, aside from having to re-build the aortic root, they have to fix the valve by most likely replacing it with another one. I'm just going to be honest…I am terrified. What has confounded this is that one of the ""helpers"" at the hospital (after my MRI) found out I live alone and kept saying, ""This is so hard, because you are so so so so alone. How WILL you DO this ALONE?"" I of course know I'm not alone. (My beloved Beagle mix just can't drive or help me with finances.) But a few nights ago, when I was writing my will and thinking ""who would even WANT my 1993 Mazda"", I felt a sense of existentialism never quite described in high school philosophy class. It feels so scary and that’s just the truth. The ""why"" of it can't be answered. I haven't eaten red meat in 10 years, I have never once smoked a cigarette, I'm not a heavy drinker. The only thing that's ever gone up my nose was probably a marble, but that was in the 70s! Aside from these fears, I'm equally terrified of the expenses about to land in my lap. I have health insurance, of course. But even insurance can't keep up with the demands of today's healthcare costs. Open heart surgery is obscene. I do know there will be a lot that's not covered by insurance. There already is. And because I'll spend time in the ICU  and re-habbing after. I won't be able to work one of the many extra jobs I do to make ends meet…for months.  So I'm trying to make myself feel better by putting it like this: I've never had a wedding or a baby. So think of all that could have been spent flying out to see me get married. Or the wedding gifts. Or the baby gifts. Since Bloomingdales won't let me register for ""Aortic Root Replacement"" or Bed, Bath and Beyond does not have a ""pig valve"" or ""aftercare"" section, think of this as a registry.In truth, I'm putting this out into the universe in hopes of easing some of the horror of this. Physically and emotionally, I feel underwater. I have no idea what my financial ""goal"" should be, but if I could just write ""life raft"" up there, I would. Even the tiniest bit of help will help and so from my crumbling heart to yours, I thank you for reading, giving or sharing.",198,584,2,192,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

It was so hard for everyone in our family and so many of our friends. As the holidays approached and we were still grieving the loss of my Dad, we got news no one could have dreamed we would hear.  Kerri was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer after a check up to address some digestive issues she was having. We were all devistated, but Kerri and Bob rose quickly.  They had a plan and quickly acted upon it as 2018 started.Kerri started chemotherapy almost immediately and has endured months of treatment, while consistently being strong and positive for herself and family. Watching her over the past few months has been a solid confirmation to me that she is beyond a doubt one of the toughest people God has placed on this earth. Her determination is phenomenal. Everything she does, her family drives her determination. My brother and their boys have also been determined – to keep Kerri and each other moving forward!After a recent scan, we learned that the cancer has grown and the chemotherapy was only marginally effective. Chemotherapy has been stopped and the option of radiation is now being explored. Kerri was refered to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where they specialize in late stage colorectal cancer. This is the BEST place in the country for her to receive treatment and she was fortunate to get an appointment.  Without a doubt – she needs to go, NOW!The CostsRight now, and the reason I am opening this page, is they need your help. This open-ended trip, as well as what lies beyond, all have an unknown price tag. It stinks that money has to be considered right now – because peace of mind is something everyone deserves.

In February, Janelle fell outside our home on her way to class and began having pain in her lower back. After a month or so she went to the hospital to see what was wrong, as it couldn’t possibly be from falling a month prior. Doctors thought it was a bruised bone, maybe a slipped disk, or possibly a kidney infection... Come April, after spending 10 days at Mass General Hospital, undergoing multiple scans and tests, Janelle had a biopsy done revealing the pain was from cancer. She was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare bone cancer most often found in children and adolescents. When I found out it was cancer, I said to myself, “Of all people to get cancer… I am absolutely stunned it’s Janelle.” If there is a poster child for healthy living and positive energy, it would be her. Before her diagnosis, Janelle was either at the yoga studio, tearin’ up the mountains in the winter, whipping up a delicious healthy (usually vegan) meal in our kitchen, or hanging with friends at the Ski and Board house. She also spent the last two years working with the UMass Amherst based nonprofit, Protect Our Breasts, an organization that focuses on sharing the conversation about chemicals in products that contribute to cancer, and empowering women to make safer choices to protect their health. Janelle is currently the co-president of the UMass Ski and Board Club, and will be beginning her senior year online this fall.  Janelle is still on track to graduate from UMass Amherst in May 2019. As Janelle continues this long journey, she needs your help!

My name is Laura Boyle and I am 27 years old from Smithfield, Rhode Island. Last year I was diagnosed with Von Hippel Lindau Disease. VHL is an extremely rare genetic condition where blood vessel tumors can form in up to ten areas of the body. These tumors can be benign or cancerous. So far, VHL has affected my adrenal glands, my pancreas, and now my brain.My first tumor was discovered when I was in college, just 19 years old. Last year they found a malignant tumor on the head of my pancreas that was resting on my small intestine. Just one short, hectic week after finding this out, my life was uprooted and I was in the OR at Rhode Island Hospital, having pancreatic surgery known as the whipple procedure. A whipple procedure entails removing part of the pancreas, stomach and small intestine, as well as the gallbladder and liver duct. The entire digestive system then needs to be rerouted. After the surgery, they determined the tumor to be pancreatic cancer called a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This led them to discover that I have a cancerous genetic disease called VHL.After more testing, they also found that I currently have three brain tumors, known as hemangioblastomas that they continue to monitor. These tumors rest on the back of my brain and spine and continue to cause symptoms like nausea and migraines. Throughout recovery, maintaining a healthy weight has been most difficult. I am severely underweight and malnourished and my tumors and digestive issues make it extremely difficult to maintain a normal 27 year old lifestyle. In recent weeks, I have had to take a leave of absence from my teaching career because of my debilitating symptoms. I have the most amazing seventh grade students this year and it breaks my heart that I am no longer well enough to teach them and spend their last few weeks of this school year with them. Right now, I ask you to please help me in any way you can. I am currently struggling to manage my symptoms enough to get back to my students, my life, my wonderful fiancé and my caring family. I am finding it more and more difficult to maintain my job, my health bills, my doctor's appointments, and pay off my student loans. If you can help in any small way, it will mean more than you know! Thank you for reading my story.  I will be using any money I earn on my medical bills and maintaining my student loans while out on leave. This is an inspirational poem I found that was written by a fellow VHL warrior. I couldn't explain my situation any better than she does!“To look at me you’d never knowBut the tumors in me just grow and growNo matter what I do or sayThey just won’t go awayAt first the feelings just flowedThe time stood still, it got very coldFrom a care free teen with my whole life aheadTo a dying teen lying in a bedThat night I lay awake till dawnAnd before I knew I had a new plan drawnI realized something in the dark of nightThat I was going to win this fightThe tumors the doc had foundThe news that put my parents on the groundThey said that I was going to dieBut I wasn’t prepared to say goodbyeSo I got myself ready for warAnd promised my loved ones I’d walk out that hospital doorAnd sure enough the road was roughBut I was never willing to give upI know my war is not over yetBut one thing I’ll never forgetTo smile in troubles remember I’m blessedGod gave me this imperfectionCause he knew I could handle the stressAnd in a funny way I’m glad for that dayfor the scars and the tearsI’ve gathered through the yearsFor all these things is what makes meMy von Hippel-Lindau, My Life, and Me.”",385,711,0,374,3 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Our nephew Calvin who's nine has been diagnosed with stage 4 / group 4 / high risk rhabdomyosarcoma, with the alveolar genetic marker. This is an aggressive form of cancer and has a 20 percent cure rate if the treatments are successful.  Because of the location of the tumors (which are pressing up against major blood vessels), surgery is not permitted at this time.  Calvin will need to undergo chemo in hopes of shrinking the tumors so that surgical removal can take place. They are still waiting on the results of the bone marrow biopsy which took place at the same time his chemo port was put in. A U.S. Army veteran, our brother Chris is the sole financial provider for his wife and four kids and has not left Calvin's side since that trip to the ER.  Chris is on family leave which unfortunately means he does not get paid.  This means there is no income to cover expenses.  Expenses that sadly won't stop adding up during this difficult and life-altering situation: gas, food, utility bills, car payments, mortgage, everyday living expenses.  These are on top of any medical bills that may occur.  This past week is just the beginning to a long battle ahead...physically, emotionally and financially.  Please help Chris and Tiffany by donating.  Any amount is helpful!  Along with your donation, prayers for Calvin are appreciated.  Updates will be provided as we learn more. We would be humbly grateful if you share our link to your social media timelines to help spread the word.

Medical,59,Stephanie Rothbauer,https://www.gofundme.com/stephanie-rothbauer,"PASO ROBLES, CA","May 30, 2018","$50,000","$31,260","Stephanie, Our Warrior Queen, has entered the ring for the fight of her life and she is going to need the support of her army and beyond to get through this, as she was recently diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML. FLT3). On Thursday, May 17, 2018 Steph was sent to Stanford Medical Center after results from a local blood test came back with dangerous levels of white blood cells. The tests were a result of Stephanie seeking medical attention after experiencing a recent series of issues that she had believed to be related to her Multiple Sclerosis. Severe headaches, debilitating in nature, a terrible ulcer on her tongue that made it impossible for her to eat and she even blacked out at one point. It was then that she realized this was beyond the challenges that she already dealt with and considered part of her “normal” with MS. Upon her arrival at Stanford they immediately began chemotherapy treatment and told her that she had cancer. It took a couple of days and a very painful bone marrow biopsy to reveal exactly what form of leukemia she would be battling. Given the seriousness of Stephanie’s already highly compromised immunity, the treatment plan for her is very individualized and she is being taken care of with extra care and attention.Tad has not left Stephanie’s side since she was admitted almost two weeks ago, and he plans on supporting her continually in the time ahead. Stephanie is currently undergoing induction chemotherapy with the hopes of putting the cancer into remission before undergoing a bone marrow transplant. If, or should I say when her marrow test comes back clean of the cancer cells, she will undergo stem cell therapy and that will then have them staying in Palo Alto an additional 100 days for 24 hour care and treatment. Much is uncertain at this point, but we do know that the Rothbauer family could use the help of each and every one of us to get through this scary, unpredictable, and very expensive journey.This Go Fund Me account is being set up to go directly to the family to pay for the many costs associated with Stephanie’s current and future treatments.ABOUT STEPHANIE:To know Steph is to love her. Her vibrancy and genuine love of life is present in everything she does. Even during these difficult times. What would cripple many has only displayed her strengths even more. This passion is displayed in everything she is a part of. She has been a supporter of the national and local MS Foundation, she’s a well-recognized interior designer (which class studies she completed in the initial stages of battling her MS), she’s an amazing participant in the county Big Brothers and Big Sisters project where she was recently honored as Big Sister of 2018. Steph received this honor because like everything she commits to she has been committed to her little sister and it is a commitment that she plans to see through the young lady’s time in school and beyond. Steph’s family is her biggest passion and her focus is and always has been to ensure that TJ (age 14), Brayden (age 12), and Mia (age 8) are happy, loved and know their place in her heart. The battle ahead is not going to be easy and the only option is that she comes out the champion, but Steph and her family are going to need all of our support facing this future of uncertainty. For a woman that lives by a plan and a calendar you can imagine the strain and fear that she is feeling and yet she does so with smiles, jokes and making the rest of us still better for being a part of her life. Let’s help where we can and take whatever burden away so that her and her family’s focus can be on her recovery and time together that is and always will be a priceless amenity.WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR:Although Stephanie and Tad have medical insurance through his employer, there are many, many costs that are not covered through insurance. Your generous donations will go towards helping pay for a variety of costs associated with Stephanie’s treatment including:- Co-pays for medications and treatmentsMany of the treatments that Stephanie is and will be receiving are VERY expensive and insurance does not always cover everything. - Gas, hotel rooms and restaurant foodStephanie is currently being treated at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, CA, a 4 hour drive north from her family’s home in Paso Robles. Her future treatments and potential bone marrow transplant will also be at least a few hours from her home. Your contributions will go directly towards covering the many ancillary costs associated with a family of five living away from home for an extended period of time.WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:In addition to donating, you can help us spread the word!

Medical,59,Timothy Tolentino,https://www.gofundme.com/timothy-tolentino,"INDIANAPOLIS, IN","April 28, 2018","$50,000","$31,200","On April 4, 2018, while at work, co-workers recognized Tim was acting in a manner not normal to a young man with personality that was active, vibrant and most of the time amusing. At that very moment this 31-year-old man's life would change forever; he was suffering a stroke. He displayed all the classic signs, dropping face, tingling on one side of his body, slurred speech and total confusion. He was taken to the emergency room where the diagnosis confirmed that Tim did suffer from a ""mini"" stroke. He stayed overnight in the hospital and after further observation he was released the next day with instructions to return for further evaluation. Shortly after his release, while walking his dogs with his girlfriend, Tasmyn, Tim once again was suffering from another stroke, this time his condition was much more severe.Test after test, Neurologist were baffled and could not pinpoint a definitive diagnosis. After much research the experts saw traits in Tim's condition and tentatively concluded that he may have a disease called Moyamoya. This disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder caused by blocked arteries at the base of the brain. This was a first for Neurologist at the Kaiser Permanente of San Diego, so they were perplexed in how to treat it. During that time, Tim had worsened even more. To the point where he could no longer speak, had lost his ability to move his right arm and became very lethargic. Initially, doctors began a regiment of blended medications in hopes it would stabilize him. Unfortunately, the medication was not working so the ultimate and last resort was for the Neurologist to perform an angioplasty to the area of Tim's brain that was not getting enough blood flow.With the grace of God and the many prayers offered up for Tim, the procedure was successful. The doctors were able to open up the vessel and to get blood flowing back into the affected area of Tim's brain. After spending one week in the Direct Observation Unit and another week in the ICU, Tim was transferred to a Rehabilitation Center where he will have to relearn how to speak, walk and do many of the basic functions of everyday life that he was doing prior to his stroke.Tim's journey is long, but he is resilient and determined to get back to some type of normality. As you can imagine the cost of his stay in the hospital, the surgery, the treatment plan, the medications and all the other expenses you can think of will be another challenge for him to overcome.To our friends, family and anyone reading this message, your donation to assist Tim in tackling this debt will be greatly appreciated. We are humbled and words or actions could never repay your kindness and generosity.  However, if you are not able to make a monetary donation, please keep Tim in your thoughts and prayers. We are thankful for your prayers as well. We truly believe that the power of prayer is the ultimate gift you can give to anyone in need. We pray that no family should go through this life changing experience that Tim and our family and friends are going through now. Many blessings to all and may God keep you in his tender care always.",409,841,16,405,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,59,Kika's Pancreatic Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/kika039s-pancreatic-cancer-funds,"MIAMI, FL","June 26, 2018","$100,000","$31,161","Our dear friend Kika (Christine Garcia-Concheso) was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer, Stage III, on June 18th. At this point, the only treatment available is chemotherapy. If she responds well and if cancer has not spread, she might be able to have surgery after several rounds of chemo, but the doctor suspects there are a few cancer spots on the liver too. We all know Kika, she is in severe pain, but always in a great mood and is enduring all the tests exceptionally well. Housing SituationKika's house was severely damaged during the hurricane last year. There was significant flooding, and she lost almost all the renovations she had done to the house a few months before, including a brand new kitchen and flooring. She has been fighting with the insurance and just now got the approval to fix the house (although she did not get all the money she was asking for). She will start renovations soon and will try to sell the house as soon as it is done. Currently, her home has no kitchen, no living room, no washer/dryer and only one functioning bathroom. That was ""fine"" until she was diagnosed with cancer. Now she cannot stay there anymore, nor she can deal with the remodeling herself (to save money she was going to supervise it). We plan to rent her a small apartment, preferably near her son and his family immediately, since she will start chemo on July 13th. In the meanwhile and whenever she wants, she will stay at my house. She knows she is always welcome here (we set up a bedroom for her) and I will do everything I can to be with her at every medical appointment and treatment, but I know she would like to have her own place and be close to her grandson. By the way, Kika's son and his family live in a two-bedroom condo, so there is no space to accommodate Kika and her beloved dogs comfortably.Work and IncomeWork-wise; the situation is even tougher. Kika always worked as an independent contractor but has no new projects (nor she can take new projects right now.) So, she will have no income at all, but a very small retirement check.Health Insurance and Medical ExpensesHer health insurance is Medicare, and she will have several out of pocket expenses. We also would like to get a second opinion from MD Anderson or John Hopkins in Maryland and to join medical trials around the U.S. that offer hope. This gofundme campaign is to help us get through the next few months until her house is sold. She plans to use the house money to pay for her future expenses. Unfortunately, we cannot wait until she sells the house and, with no new project/work, she cannot afford to rent an apartment or pay for her mortgage, treatment, and medication. I know Kika has some great friends out there and that you all will help her through this. Any amount is highly appreciated. I plan to post a few updates here, but if you would like to contact Kika and/or myself directly, please email TeamWinKika@gmail.com. We both have access to that email so that I can send updates in her behalf. Thank you all so very much.",163,619,6,165,2 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
