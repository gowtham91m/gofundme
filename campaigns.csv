He's always been ready with a helping hand, whether it was introducing us to the wild world of Amazon, teaching us something new, or just being a great friend when we needed it. It's hard to think of someone who is more willing to jump in and be there to do the right thing.It’s our turn to help Ryan and his family however we can. As some of you may already know, Ryan had to have surgery to remove an infection that was next to his spine. Unfortunately the surgery ended with complications and Ryan came out of surgery paralyzed from the chest down. He will be in a rehab hospital for several months. The Leslie family home will need to be remodeled to accommodate a wheelchair and they will also need to purchase a different vehicle. It’s unknown what insurance will cover and what type of long term care will be needed.Any donation will go directly to Ryan and his family to help cover medical and home care expenses.",326,869,3,328,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

As a result Bill was paralyzed from the neck down and has lived the last 48 years of his life as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. Bill took on his disability the same way he played sports, with courage and determination, and has lived these years independently, graduating from, working for, and retiring from UC Berkeley, initially as an early medical retirement, and now, full retirement.However, upon his full retirement in June Bill lost a major source of income, UC sponsored Long Term Disability payments at $900.00 per month. Bill used these funds to help pay for his daily attendant care needs required for a quadriplegic to live independently. The loss of these funds threatens Bill’s ability to live independently in his home. In addition, concurrently with this loss of income, both his needs for, and the cost of, attendant care are rising. Bill anticipated this loss of income a year before it happened and diligently cut back on his expenses at home and researched other ways to replace the income in order to pay for attendant care, through social services and public benefits, but to no avail, as the options were either disqualifying or share of cost prohibitive.As well, recent serious illness, surgery, and hospitalizations have left Bill recovering in bed since January, and the need for attendant care increasing even further than anticipated and his newly reduced income will now barely cover the cost of basic attendant care, if that. In addition to Bill’s normal daily routine of an attendant getting him out of and into his bed into and out of his wheelchair daily, and helping with his morning and evening hygiene and medication regimes, attendant care is needed when he is bedbound to bring him meals, turn him in his bed to prevent pressure sores, help with the same daily hygienic and medication regimes but now including assistance with respiratory therapies and wound care.Bill’s need for financial assistance is immediate and will be ongoing for attendant care and possibly other needs such as adaptive equipment for everyday living that could help mitigate some of the attendant care needs by keeping Bill healthier, back in his wheelchair, able to do more for himself without help, and out of the hospital.Throughout Bill’s life he always thought of others before himself in his school, family, and work lives, whether through his kindness, his volunteer work, or his patient listening to our stories and complaints, and now it is our turn to think of and support Bill.",230,189,2,293,1 month,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are reaching out to our friends, family, well-wishers and looking at crowd funding options to raise money to help with the treatment costsHow it beganIt all started in 2009, when training for a half a marathon, Smitha noticed a sudden onset of fatigue. She went from running 5mi comfortably to needing breaks every half a mile.She also noticed that her flip flops would keep coming off her feet while she was walking.Within a week, she felt an odd tingling sensation in her fingers that spread to her arms.  Followed by cold wet droplets on her face and neck.As these symptoms worsened, she knew something was seriously wrongIn Sept2009, at age of 24, Smitha was diagnosed with MSWhat is MS?MS is an auto-immune disease that affects the central nervous system.Our nerves have a protective sheathing called Myelin. This ensures that electrical impulses can travel through the length of the nervous system. In MS, the patient’s immune system marks this myelin as a threat and starts to attack them. As the myelin gets depleted, the brain can no longer communicate with the rest of the body effectively.The loss of Myelin shows up as black / white scar marks in MRI. MS attacks in waves. And, each attack results in further myelin loss. This directly translates to increased physical disability in the patient.When Smitha was diagnosed with MS, she was still a student. Her Student Health insurance did not cover the treatment costs. She could not afford to pay for her medication, out of pocket.In just 4 months after her diagnosis, hit by a giant relapse. The severity of attack alarming and it affected her quality of life permanently After coming to terms with these new physical limitations, we decided to make the best of what life had to offer. We traveled when we could, added a dog to our family, fostered a few dogs, charted our future, and eventually started thinking about starting our own family. In Jan2016, we were blessed with not just one, but a set of Twin boys!In the 9 years since her diagnosis, Smitha’s condition has constantly been worsening due to multiple relapses. Each relapse has required her to change to the next strongest FDA approved meds in market and none of them have been effective. After another attack in May 2018, we found out that our options for more drugs were quickly running out.We are now at to a point where we need to make some hard choices. If left untreated, the next MS attack could happen any moment. And that can lead to vision loss, memory issues, complete loss of bladder control and even needing a wheelchair permanently.Our kids are only 2.5 years old. And, in these 2.5 years, Smitha has been forced to watch the kids growfrom the sidelines.She was NOT there when the kids took their first steps.She was NOT there when the boys entered the swimming pool for the first time.She has NOT been able to walk with them to the neighborhood parkAnd, she knows, she won’t be able to help them ride a bike,or , play ball with them in the evenings,Or, come running to their aid, when they need her help.After her recent relapse, she has been feeling so exhausted, that she cannot even pick up her kids or even talk coherently when tired.All of this can change though. And the answer is in an extremely promising clinical trial called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, or HSCT.HSCT is the first and only medical procedure that can not only stop MS, but also reverse the symptoms of MS, by re-growing the lost myelin. The idea here is to wipe out the faulty immune system in the body with Chemotherapy, then reintroduce the patient’s stem cells and build a new immune system from scratch. This hard reboot of the immune system is a rigorous procedure that takes about a month and a half to complete. It is a risky procedure and is only administered to patients that have an aggressive case of MS and who have not responded well to other FDA approved medications. Among such patients, the results from past trials have been very promising. In upto 87% of the cases, this reprogrammed immune system does not attack the myelin again and thereby stops further progression of the disease. It has also shown to significantly reduce the patient’s disability and patients show continued recovery even after 4 years post treatment.But, the best of the insurance programs do not cover this procedure, as it is not FDA approved yet, which has put the entire burden of raising the money for this procedure on us.The last time the insurance did not cover her treatment MS dealt a swift and devastating blow. We are fully committed to defeating MS this time around.And with your help, we will be a step closer to achieving that goal.We don’t have much to offer you other than our gratitude. All we can say, is thanks for supporting us in our fight. There are a few ways in which you can choose to donate and help us out. You can read about this in the More Info section.You can also help by sharing this link on social media. Tag your friends you think might help. Also share this with friends and family who might be suffering from diseases like Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, progressive scleroderma or other forms of autoimmune disease. The same treatment mentioned above can help turn around their lives too.If we do manage to go beyond our goals, we will donate all the excess money to the next patient who is eligible for this trial and for whom the insurance does not cover this life changing procedure.",600,1.2k,0,584,10 days,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,11,Help Patrick Fight Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/hud44-help-patrick-fight-cancer,"PHILADELPHIA, PA","March 29, 2018","$75,000","$67,895","Hello, my name is Crystal Nardone, and my husband, Patrick Connors, is a painter, art scholar, and an art teacher. He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate. Thank you.",565,1.6k,14,565,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are the fortunate friends of Jane Schiowitz and we are ready to move mountains for our fierce pal as she fights brain cancer, but we need your help.Jane is a mom, a wife, a daughter, and a sister, but to us she is our creative, fun-loving, loyal friend whose infectious laugh fills any room. (Jane & her husband Rick Brooks)She is a gifted artist by trade and an amazing Mom to her teenage son.(Jane & her son Julian)
In early March 2018, Jane started having strange symptoms: facial spasms, numbness, and weakness on her left side.  An MRI revealed a tumor on the right side of her brain.  Living close to New York City, Jane was able to get exceptional medical care. Surgery on March 14 resulted in the removal of 95 percent of the tumor. While her surgery was successful, the type of cancer she has — glioblastoma — is aggressive and may come back. Within the next month, Jane will undergo intensive treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy and a clinical trial at Sloane-Kettering. This next phase of treatment is arduous and costly.



After digesting this news, we decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf. Jane has not been able to work since her diagnosis and will not be able to work throughout the course of her treatment, which will also create a significant financial hardship for her family. She will and has already incurred significant expenses due to her recent neurosurgery, hospital stay and rehabilitation. These medical expenses are adding up quickly and will be prohibitive.Jane’s wonderful spirit has touched so many people. We hope that we 


can raise $75,000 to help defray her medical costs and ease her family’s financial burden which will allow her to focus on beating cancer.You can keep up with her latest progress and share your well wishes on her Facebook page.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking an interest in this very dear cause.   (Jane and her sister Nan)

The pregnancy was going well until complications started to emerge. Then the beginnings of a heart-breaking nightmare began to unfold. Little Aaron was born prematurely on Wednesday, August 1st and was delivered by emergency C-section. His health took a sharp downturn when he suddenly stopped breathing. Aaron was taken to the ICU where it was discovered he had an infection. Worse, Claire also came down with an infection that required immediate surgery. It was so aggressive, that Claire had four separate surgeries to remove all of it (it had invaded a large amount of tissue including several organs). The doctors worked frantically to eradicate the infection, but sadly, didn't expect her to live.  By a miracle, Claire has beat the odds, but she is still in critical condition. As with any medical treatment, the cost (so far) of treating her and her newborn son has been astronomical. Zack has been with his wife the entire time so their income has stopped. The continued treatment and recovery will take months and will certainly be financially devastating. It is hard to determine how much all the bills will add up to, but Zack and Claire are in urgent need of financial assistance to help them cover all the costs and stay on their feet. In the meantime, prayers are requested and much appreciated.

Medical,12,Detective Atkinson Needs Assistance,https://www.gofundme.com/detective-atkinson-needs-assistance,"WEST ISLIP, NY","April 29, 2018","$50,000","$63,978","Detective Jamie Atkinson is a highly decorated, 36 year old officer who has been employed with the New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department for the past 15 years.  On his days off, he serves on the Board of Directors for his local volunteer EMS organization and works as a Safety Officer at Northwell Health.  Jamie has always answered calls for assistance with a selfless enthusiasm, whether it was responding to ground zero as a volunteer EMT after the September 11th Terrorist Attack to provide countless hours of search and recovery operations, responding to and investigating crime scenes or organizing a local charity event.  However on Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Detective Jamie Atkinson answered the call that would change his life forever.  When he answered the phone, Jamie immediately knew that this call was different than the thousands of calls that he had answered in the past.  This call was from his doctor who, after advising Jamie to acquire a CT scan of his abdomen after examining him for chronic pain and swelling, called to inform him that he needed to immediately respond to a specialist for further testing.  The CT scan the doctor explained, had revealed what appeared to be multiple masses in his abdomen.  Further testing would later reveal the diagnoses of a rare condition known as Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP).  PMP occurs when a cancerous tumor in the appendix creates a high grade cancerous Mucin (cells that create a cancerous mucus) that eventually ruptures through the appendix wall causing the Mucin to fill the abdominal cavity, where it continually produces cancerous mucus.  This cancerous mucus then spreads to other organs where it creates new tumors.  It is estimated that this condition occurs in only 1 per 1,000,000 persons a year.  Doctors believe that Jamie’s exposure to the many airborne carcinogens during his countless hours volunteering at ground zero in the aftermath of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks has contributed to this cancer.At this time, Jamie is currently undergoing bi-weekly chemotherapy treatments in order to shrink the cancerous tumors in his abdomen prior to his upcoming scheduled surgery.  This invasive surgery, which could take up to 15 hours to complete, consists of the removal of several organs and the placement of “heated” chemotherapy directly into the abdomen during surgery in an attempt to destroy any remaining microscopic cancer cells.  The recovery from this surgery, which is referred to as the mother of all surgeries, could leave Jamie in the Intensive Care Unit for upwards of a month.  The surgery and recovery process will not only cause an incredible emotional burden on Jamie’s family, but it will also cause a steep financial burden on them as well.  Not only will the family have to take off numerous days from work to support Jamie throughout the surgery and month long recovery process, but the family will also have to travel or stay overnight near the hospital, which is located in New York City.Jamie has always answered the call for anyone who was in need of assistance.  Now it is our time to answer his call and to provide the family with as much support as possible.  Please know that this fund is being handled by fellow MTA Police Lieutenant Chris Nutter, who has worked with Jamie for the past 15 years.  Lt. Nutter in no way intends to benefit financially from this fund and 100% of the donations raised will go directly to the Atkinson Family to assist with any financial expenses incurred during the surgery and recovery process.  Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.",619,1.7k,8,624,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Jen was in the 31st week of her first pregnancy and thought of nothing but the baby’s health. Within two days, doctors located two embolisms-one in Jen’s heart and one in her lung, as well as a “mass” in her heart. The “mass” turned out to be angio-sarcoma, a very rare form of cancer.On Friday, April, 6, 2018, Jen underwent her first chemotherapy treatment. She will continue to have weekly treatments of chemotherapy until doctors are able to deliver her baby at 37 weeks. Her treatments will resume two weeks after the baby is born. There are simply no words that can adequately describe the fear and the heartache Jen and her husband Matt have endured these past two weeks.Jen and Matt were made for each other. They met while volunteering for Youth Group, a program designed to provide academic opportunities for children in need. Through their shared love of history (they are both teachers), travel, education, and volunteerism, they fell in love and married in 2008. I met Jen when she started teaching at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Currently, Jen teaches Advanced Placement U. S. History and Psychology, a demanding schedule for any veteran teacher, but Jen’s dedication and hard work quickly made her one of the most respected members of the faculty.Jen is the type of teacher who spends countless hours before and after school helping students, some of whom are not even in her classes, with their schoolwork. She is constantly organizing fieldtrips, advising clubs, and volunteering her time to those in need. Every year Jen lets her hair grow, only to cut and donate it to The Jimmy Fund’s program that provides wigs for cancer patients. Just last year, Jen was voted the “Most Inspirational Teacher” and was also awarded “Teacher of the Year.” As a person, Jen is the most selfless person I know. She’s never too busy to sit down with a colleague. Take today for instance, while in intensive care Jen sent out a group text to our department reminding us of a colleague’s birthday, even apologizing for not being able to make his favorite dessert. There has never been a birthday or special occasion Jen has not remembered and celebrated.When Jen and Matt found out they were expecting a baby, it was a dream come true for them. Their excitement was infectious, both had dreamt of being parents. But since March 31th, their life will never be the same. Jen and Matt are both teachers and the medical bills are starting to pile up. Matt works in Providence, RI and has been making the daily trip from Providence to Boston to be with his best friend. Unfortunately, there is a long road ahead.With all the anxiety and fear they are experiencing, the financial burden is one that we are hoping to alleviate. Please consider donating to help Jen and Matt on their long journey but most of all, please pray for them. Thank you and please share this message, as I know Jen would be doing everything in her power to help anyone else in this situation.Sincerely,Mindy Morin",954,1.7k,12,956,4 months,19 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

As you know my favorite things to share are my kids and people helping people. My goal in to show you how awesome my family is or to make you smile. There is so much negativity in the world i like to share the good things. I don’t share much personal stuff on here so this next post is going to be quite hard for me. There is a part of my story that I have kept silent for some time now. Every time I open up about it I seem to gain a new understanding or some knowledge that may help me. I am not ashamed, I was just hoping to tell this story from the other side but it’s taking a little longer than I hoped. If you’ve been wondering why i haven’t been around or as involved as much as usual, here’s why! So….Feb. 23rd 2017, I got a phone call telling me that I had metastatic melanoma. Yes, a phone call! I had a swollen lymph node on my right side, went to a surgeon and had it removed. Feb. 23rd they called and told me what it was. If you want to hear about how horribly they delivered the news I can tell you in person. But, lets not dwell on the lame parts of this story!. So, here’s the deal. I got some scans immediately and nothing else showed up. I was elated!!! The doctors at SCCA at Evergreen put me on immunotherapy as a “insurance” plan. It’s called adjuvent therapy. Well, this therapy made me super sick last summer. I was sick from the 5th of July until about the 15th. (103 degree temp etc…). They took me off this therapy and gave me a high dose of prednisone. That is the worst good drug out there. If you’ve ever had it, you know what i am talking about. It makes you feel like you drank 16 cups of coffee and you are severely agitated. (sorry Jessie)Sept. 2017 we did a scan and found 6 new locations of potential disease. Two of which are on my liver (no bueno). I started a new immunotherapy called pembrolizimab (same as Keytruda ads on TV) and this had a mixed response but was not working as well as we hoped so, they placed me on a “clinical trial”. I tried that for a while, it sucked; bad side effects and had to get shots in my stomach daily for a while. The side effects have been rough. I had some serious migraines (which I never suffered from before), hearing loss, ringing in my ears, cluster headaches with stroke like symptoms etc… (Thank you Mercer Island Fire Dept., I hoped I would never have to call you but you were great). Needless to say some of the side effects have sucked! Good news, almost all of them have reversed!!! Yeah! I did some scans after being in the trial for a while and they found that I had 26% tumor progression. They allow up to 20% but 26% was too high so they took me off of the trial. The good news is my tumors were really small so 26% progression means they are still small. This brings us to now. I recently got in touch with some friends who encouraged me to go to CA to get some opinions. I have seen doctors at UCLA and MD Anderson in Texas. I have been to Texas two times in the last two weeks and have had a couple of tumors removed in the event we try T-cell therapy in the future. Right now I am eagerly awaiting to find out what my next treatment plan will be. I had surgery last week and am still recovering. It has been very painful but getting better slowly. The good news is that although my diagnosis is ""stage 4 metastatic melanoma"" there are a number of different treatment options still available to me. (the stages are based off of the last 10 years of survival rates. The medications today were not even available 2 years ago) I am an optimist to a fault as you all know. This has been a hard battle and will continue to be hard but I WILL WIN! I repeat, I WILL WIN!. I would love any and all support you can spare. I am a helper and i am terrible at asking for help when i need it. I want to give a big shout out to my wife Jessie and my Family. There is no way i could do this without them. Jessie has taken care of all the paperwork (there is TONS) so i can just focus on being healthy and not thinking about it until i need to. Jessie is a rockstar and i am thankful for her daily. My parents and in laws have helped us with airfare and hotel stays while traveling to all these appointments. I didn't think having an illness could require so much travel and travel is expensive, especially when it's last minute. Not worrying about the financial burden of these trips has been amazing. Thank you to everyone that already knows and has been helping silently. There are many of you that have provided prayer, hugs, dinners etc. This is the first time in my life i have been dealt something i can't ""handle"" on my own. I have learned a lot over this past year and continue to learn daily. first and foremost i have learned i need to lean on other people when i need them. Don’t be offended if I didn’t tell you about this. I shared this with few people hoping it would be a quick battle and i could tell my story when it was over. What can you do/How can you help:-I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP, IM TERRIBLE AT ASKING FOR HELP!-DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF MY KIDS!(they know but let me handle any discussions about it)-DON’T TREAT ME LIKE IM SICK(if you do, i may punch you in the throat and ask how you are This is a part of my story now, what it means to be Kirk Robinson, K-Rob, Kirky, Nino, hollywood, surfer boy or whatever you may call me. I wouldn't have picked this part of the story line, that's for sure. No sense being upset at the cards your dealt, just play them the best you can! I have met several people along this journey that i wouldn't have met otherwise. I am thankful for their support and their encouragement to share my story! Jim Brown, Ann Jarris Adam Throop, Melinda McKinley-throop, Rob Sweet and my ""text prayer group"". One group of people Monster and Sea heard my story through a friend and i found a card in my mailbox with some money to help us out. Timing could not have been better! I was so choked up that a group of people would want to help like this. It meant more than you can imagine!Please keep me and my family in your prayers! I know God has control over this. I pray daily that my eyes are open to the things around me and that i will be healed. I am a Blessed man, I am so lucky to have the family and friends that i do. I am thankful daily!HERES TO KICKING CANCERS ASS!!!!!

Medical,12,Help for special needs kid/moving,https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid,"MACON, GA","May 25, 2018","$75,000","$63,210","https://youtu.be/_Owd9bx-RCUHello, thank you for taking time to read my campaign for our son, David. Like any family, when our son hurts, we hurt. When my husband wakes up our son for school in the mornings it tears my soul apart when he tells me when I get home from work that David has vomited in his sleep because he had a seizure. The thought that he could have died right there in his bed is the worst possible nightmare that We could ever have and the fear of it becoming reality set us in motion to save our son. A kind service dog has eased, but not erased the worry and dread by standing guard of him and being able to detect and alert to the oncoming seizures so  that my husband can now half way sleep knowing that he will hear her cries for help when David’s voice is gone.The Doctors tried him on many medications (some all at once) to try and stop the seizures as he was having them daily. These medications almost cost him his life just because of their chemical nature. We trusted these Doctors that their medical expertise with these medications were in David’s best interest, past my own knowledge, my husband researched them and wow the side effects, and then watched these dangerous chemicals that are prescribed in good faith have a different chemical reaction in our son that could not have been foreseen, the seizures got worse, our son has fought many times for his life with Doctors fighting to bring him back and keep him here. David has a service dog, seizures, seizure medications, and Doctors. What he doesn’t have is the ability to be a child because the seizures have stolen his childhood from him. He cannot even ride his bike to the park with friends. What would happen if he had a seizure crossing the street? He cannot go to school and enjoy when he is so tired and recovering from days of seizures to the point he was going to have to be isolated even more and taught at home. David cannot just go be a kid with his friends because “What if this is THE seizure that We have been tearing our hearts and brains  apart to stop, and prayerfully begging that never comes. Neither of us can protect him in his own bed, let alone away from home. His dog helps detect and alert, but she would not be able to render the medical care that he would need. We would have to just trust that some stranger would recognize it, and call for help. Also hope that someone driving the street where he fell did not look down at the radio, or to another distraction for a split second and hit David or Malory. Can any father or mother  in good faith trust their child’s life to the hands of potential strangers? If a parent did, would they have their child’s best interest? Are we really doing the right thing by imprisoning him for any reason and watching his childhood pass him by? How do We keep from hating ourselves because we are supposed to be able to fix this and protect him? What can We do? Nobody can save our son, and neither of us are willing to accept letting him go, or his innocence of catching lightening bugs and bringing me a wilted flower that he had in his pocket for an hour or the dead bug to his dad that he accidentally sat on die in our faces. His eyes search us for help, and we have none.In February 2018, after my husband did some researching and wrestling with the idea, asking myself about the law, the thought of giving something illegal to our child that was for our entire childhood “a bad and dangerous drug,” we started treating him with Marijuana. Unfortunately it is still illegal here in Georgia. We had plans and hopes of getting him on a good track with school, and referred out of state to better and broader medical practices. We both demanded to know what is going into our child, and while we did everything we could to know, neither of us had any legal access to a Doctor’s experience with different kinds. We knew the risks that we read, the medical research that We both had to pour over for hours fighting what is right/legal/safe/moral, I informed all of his medical team because we wanted our son to be safe. I was not advised to stop treating him this way along with safer medications from the Doctor. The Doctor did not comment exactly why, but I think she wanted to see for herself. The combination granted our son 71 days seizure FREE!!!!! For 71 days our son rode his bike, woke up, went to school, played with friends, played outside, and the terror for his life that gripped our hearts and souls began to lift. The smiles on our faces reflecting our child getting to be a normal child. Safe in his bed. Doing better in school. Having a great quality of life. We were breaking the law. We saved our son. We were fixing the fragments the best way we could of him being that little boy that was taken away from him by these seizures. This is our job as parents, to protect our child even with our own lives. As I wrote above, I kept his medical team up to date. As we felt we had found his miracle, and anyone else who saw his medical history would see this too. We also felt like his entire medical team truly cared for him and wanted the same things we did, and with honesty on my part and his safety forefront of every visit, we were winning. This transparency also meant informing a new therapist who did not share our joys or beliefs that allowing him access to marijuana was worth this new life he had begun. I was reported to DCFS, and on April 19, 2018 their representatives along with deputy sheriff’s entered our home with our cooperation and full truth of what and why, and despite the evidence, demanded that I stop “abusing” our son by giving him this “dangerous” marijuana. Allowing him to have debilitating seizures that threaten his life and any quality of that life was quite okay as long as he was not using marijuana. They did not even apply his medical team’s observations and findings to their opinions. If you are unsure what is worse, look up seizure medication side effects. Then look up medical research for marijuana usage as seizure treatment. Compare the two with success rates, side effects, birth defects that are known, long term effects that are known, what class of drug they are in by abuscability, pretend David is your child, and tell us honestly that following the law, but risking his life is better than trying something that is illegal, but with mountains of medical data as to it’s worth as a treatment to the point on becoming legal in certain states. We stood behind our decision to save our son’s life even though we had not made the move yet, and openly admitted to allowing him to use it for the treatment of his seizures. We have never lied about where he got it, or our intentions. The DCFS demanded that we cease this immediately. Against our better judgement, we did. They were not there for the times my husband had to drag our son to the truck because it takes 45 minutes for help to arrive. They were not there for the times that we carried him out of the house to break the traffic laws to get him the help he so desperately needed. They were not there to see my husband loose several jobs because we were rushing our son to get medical help. They were not there when we spent almost 3 months in an emergency room everyday because our son was being transported because he’d done had another seizure either at home or at school, or that 2 weeks out of those 3 months was spent at a hospital in Atlanta begging the doctors to take him off the medication that was killing him. There was no way we could afford to get him to a state that could help him fast enough to stop what we both knew was coming and even told the DCFS representative and officer. Even working two jobs as I do and the 4 that my husband does. There was a small hope that once they could see his seizures returning, and his Doctor’s recommendations that they would see we were not any of those other types of the parents that they see so often it hardens their hearts to only seeing laws and what the state deems acceptable parenting. Maybe they would allow me just enough time to get him to the help of a medical center in an appropriate state. Within14 hours of the marijuana being stopped without consulting his Doctor, even with the safer seizure medications still administered, his service dog was alerting my husband as I was filling out paperwork for the DCFS office, David’s eyes filled with dread, fear, and hopelessness as all Matthew could do was watch it happen and get him to the hospital, and before my heart could even beat, he was in the grips of this horrible, evil, monster that threatens his life again. We felt sure they would see now. We felt sure they would not be able to ignore the obvious and blatant evidence in front of their faces, and the loss of childhood in our son’s face. This was not correct. While our son fought for his life, officially in DCFS custody and flatlining 15 times according to medical records, my husband was arrested, they tore me from my baby’s side and told me they were going to take custody of him as I was arrested too. They say he is not safe with us while a medical team tries to start his heart again because they have stopped his treatment by what they know of the law and their opinion. Then by opinion of the hospital’s police staff, my son’s service dog was removed and put into the city pound without allowing me the federally mandated, and legally protected, reasonable amount of time to seek someone to take custody of her. The officer from what I understand of the service dog laws outlined by the ADA website, violated federal law that protects these working animals and their handlers. We broke a state law in hopes of saving my son. In turn, our son’s federal rights as protected under the ADA laws were violated because of ignorance of what the laws state regarding service animal identification, and the federal laws dictating how a service dog with an incapacitated handler must be treated. How do we at the least help this department repair their ignorance of the federal laws? I asked people who advocate for the understanding of laws concerning service animals if I was incorrect in what I read. They explained what the laws state for each thing specifically that happened. They cannot legally tell me who was right or wrong as we all have a right to tell our own side of every story without the assumption of guilt. On my own reporting, I did, in fact, understand the laws that I believe were violated. I now have an obligation to become an advocate myself when our son is back in our arms and living his beautiful, young life.She is our son’s link to the conscious world when he is trapped in the grips of those seizures and cannot cry for help himself. She is his voice, his hero, and his Angel. She has a job that has improved all of our lives from him choking on his own vomit in his sleep because she will make sure someone hears her and gets to him. Instead of being treated as a valuable life and life saving dog, she was thrown into her own type of prison for 7 days. “Actually innocent, but decidedly guilty based on ignorance of the law” is what I would name that kind of charge. Seven days this life saving animal went without anyone she knew, strange foods, strange scheduling, strange dogs (who knows if they were friendly or not), exposure to a myriad of diseases, and was treated like an animal thrown away.  Vaccinations are our first line defense, but they do, on occasion fail our dogs. She risks that when she leaves our house. Just as we risk being attacked by a shark if we swim in the ocean. We know the risk, and that is why we do not jump into known, high shark activity laden waters with an open wound. Pounds cannot help except to be a possible breeding ground for diseases. They must house stray dogs whether they know the histories of the dogs or not. They cannot deny going and picking up a dog reported just because they do not know if it has had vaccinations. They can quarantine if equipped for that, and if the pound has adequate space and vet staff. Our son’s service dog is priceless in alerting to get David help, and she was cast aside just like our son’s childhood and quality of life. She has this way that is unique to them to speak to his whole mind and assure him that he is going to open his eyes to her again. She is amazing, and deserves to always be treated as such. We do not want to risk losing the only link we have to him to assure him that Matt and mommy are fighting for him when he cannot see and hear us. This wonderful, furry, angel tells him so. She wants her boy back almost as much as we do.Because of all of this, we want to move our child and family to a state with the medical resources to help him. We have found a lawyer who is the best of the best. She has reviewed and has been very optimistic in her ability to help us get our son back, and move him to a place where he can be monitored with regulated, specially grown marijuana that is designed to treat his individual needs uniquely. Our son deserves life. I am asking for help to save our son. Please donate if you are able so that we can hire this attorney and save him. If you are unable to donate, please understand that we are in deepest appreciation of prayers for our son to be okay and be a little boy riding his bike, and looking forward to going to school again, and so proud and excited when he learns new things and makes good grades. This just hurts so badly. We feel so afraid for him, and everything in both of us cries and screams to save him. We do not know if he is being cared for like a child or a case number. We only hear things that bother us deeply, and all we can do is turn it over to the lawyer to now fight the greatest battle of our lives in having our heart returned to us safe and sound and knowing that we now know the correct path of helping him, and can do this the legal way. It has proven to be the correct way by the medical evidence of only 71 days alone. Please, help us if you are able. We only want our baby back and to see him play and grow without fear of these seizures that were stealing him away from us before he was taken away by DCFS. We want all of him back, and have proven that we will do anything to protect him. The difference is that now, we are educating ourselves on the correct way, and imagining an even better outcome for his health with the proper care.Thank You! https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid?sharetype=teams&member=227462&rcid=r01-152732054834-745a05a4a60247a6&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m",988,2.5k,20,959,3 months,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Among many things, SJS attacks the mucus membranes and left his lungs severely damaged. He went from being a successful multisport athlete and student, to one that struggled aerobically on the field. Not willing to quit, he trained to become a Goal Keeper hoping he could reduce the cardiovascular demands on his body and hoping he could continue to play the game he loved. Dylan adjusted to his new base line of 50% lung capacity and still competed at some of the highest club and high school soccer levels. His teammates will remember him as the player who finished the runs long after the rest of the team, but he always finished. His determination and commitment to everything he did was admirable. Over the past 4 years his lungs declined further from a MRSSA infection and then Pneumonia. At 18%, he had to make the hardest call of his life to the college coach he had committed to play soccer for in Minnesota; his primary concern was not himself, but for the teammates that he knew would depend on him. Evaluation began in September 2017 at University of Washington Medical Center for potential Bilateral Lung Transplant. On Saturday, July 14th Dylan received the incredible gift of new Lungs from a donor, something he can only repay by making the same commitment to life he always has. This type of organ transplant is a very intensive surgery that comes with life-long requirements for medications and treatments. The love and support of all his family and friends has gotten him through this and his motivation to use this gift in positive ways is evident in everything he does.""Want to succeed as bad as you want to breath"" ~Dylan",142,383,9,142,1 month,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

My husband’s name is Stephen Boulanger and he has been struggling with brain cancer since November 2008. If any of you know Steve personally then you would know what a fun, amazing person he is. He has always been really smart and witty. He is a loving husband and father to two young children and a great friend to many. I think one of my favorite things about Steve is that he can always make me laugh. I mean really laugh like until your sides start to hurt laugh. I love this about him! Steve has gone through so much in his young life and it really hasn’t been fair, but he has still found hope despite the challenges.   I honestly don’t know how he has managed to stay so upbeat and positive. He keeps fighting and I admire him greatly for this.  I will never forget when Steve was first diagnosed with a brain tumor. I was actually with him when he had a sudden grand mal seizure in a coffee shop. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and we later discovered that the seizure was caused by a golf ball sized grade 2 oligoastrocytoma. This discovery would change our lives forever. Steve had an awake craniotomy (brain surgery) in December 2008 to have the tumor removed.  The surgery was successful, but the tumor began to return a few years later in October 2011, at which time Steve wasrequired to undergo six weeks of radiation treatment. I have to brag and say how strong my husband was during the radiation treatment. He received radiation every morning before work and then worked a full day of work without skipping a beat. It really amazes me how he did this without complaint.  You would never have known that he was receiving radiation treatment.   After a few stable years, the tumor began to grow again, and Steve underwent a second awake brain surgery in  September 2016.   A portion of the tumor was removed, but they couldn’t get it all without risking paralyzing him.  Unfortunately, the tumor started to grow again and Steve underwent another series of radiation treatments. This was followed by chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful.  The tumor was growing. Steve started experiencing alarming symptoms that were caused by the tumor. His right arm and right leg became very weak.  He began a new chemotherapy but again the tumor was spreading. Steve had to stop working and continues to be unable to work.  He has lost mobility in his right arm and right leg.  He is also experiencing short term memory issues. We are waiting to see if we are eligible to receive an experimental chemotherapy drug that is very expensive. We may be able to receive this drug as a charitable donation through the company.  Please pray that we do.  Steve has also started eating a Keto diet.  There have been some successful studies and testimonials that show that the Keto diet can help people with brain tumors and we are praying that Steve’s tumor shrinks while on this new way of eating.  Right now, I am Steve’s primary care giver.   I am unable to work because Steve needs daily care.  It has been heartbreaking to watch the person you love the most go through so many struggles.   My children are also watching their Daddy struggle and this is tough as well.  We are asking for donations, however big or small, to help with medical expenses, food for his new diet, and living expenses.  We feel so blessed to have supportive family and friends.   Please consider donating to this fund and if not, then please pray for Steve.   We are praying for a miracle.

Backstory:  As many of you know, 6 months ago, our Dad (Dan Frost), was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. His particular type of cancer is rare and more complex than the majority of prostate cancer cases. Because of this, choosing the right treatment has taken time. The last 6 months we have watched our parents spend countless hours researching, meeting with multiple oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and looked at almost every alternative medicine path available. After much prayer and seeking wisdom in an extremely difficult decision process, our Dad has finally felt peace and made a decision to move forward with 7 weeks of radiation treatment at UCLA Medical Center. He will have two different kinds of radiation that will both target the tumors on his prostate and the area surrounding the prostate, where cancer cells may have migrated.We are a family that believes in the power of prayer and a God who is more than able to heal cancer completely! While we cry out daily to see our Dad healed in this way, we know that he is faithfully walking out the course the Lord has him on for now. Plot Twist: One week away from his scheduled treatment, Dad and Mom received a 30 day notice to leave their home of seven years. Their landlord is selling the property they have been renting in Redding, CA. Because they need to be in LA for 2 months of treatment for Dad, they now only have two weeks to be out of their house. They are quickly packing up their home and placing all their belongings in storage. A few of us kids are taking some time off work to fly out to help them pack and take care of the heavy lifting. They will head to LA with just their suitcases and car, but expectant for God to show them the next steps toward a home. Strongest people we know need help:If you know our story, you know that 17 years ago our parents were called into full time ministry working with political leaders on Capitol Hill. They’ve poured out their life and finances to serve the kingdom. They haven’t skipped a beat in spite of cancer and are continuing to serve. Through this season so many of you have asked us how you can help. As their family we would love if you joined with us in covering them in this process.Prayers:We first and foremost need your prayers. Will you join us as we cover our Dad in the following areas: - Seeking God with us in seeing our Dad’s body completely healed. - Pray for God’s presence and wisdom to guide every doctor in this complicated treatment. - Pray that treatment attacks cancer in every location of our Dad’s body and that it won’t return. - Pray for both our parents to have supernatural strength and that the stress of all the details won’t take a toll on their spirits or bodies.Finances:Cancer not only comes with a heavy burden health wise, but also with a hefty price tag. We are watching our parents bills grow with medical expenses, scans/treatments that are not covered by insurance, cost of travel to appointments out of state, lodging, prescriptions and now the expenses of moving and finding a new home. It is our hearts to go above and beyond to help cover all the extra costs associated with this journey. We would love if you considered joining us by helping them financially. Every little bit helps and will give them one less thing they have to worry about during this incredibly difficult time. Thank you:We also want to recognize and thank all of you who have showed up for our parents in the most profound ways.  Your prayers, notes, phone calls, texts, financial support, houses, helping hands and so much more has so deeply touched the hearts of our parents. We often receive phone calls with our parents in tears from the kindness and generosity that has been shown to them from so many. We can confidently say they have felt so surrounded and loved in this process. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us hold up our parents arms up during a time when they are needing it most!

Medical,22,Healing Hendrix,https://www.gofundme.com/HendrixTorres,"SAN DIEGO, CA","May 20, 2018","$50,000","$49,491","Dear Friends & Family, Most of you are aware that our son Hendrix has been having a pretty rough time the last couple of months. We now think everything began this past November when he was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. Soon after that diagnosis, we noticed he started having motor tics and began complaining of neck pain, nausea and stomachaches. About that same time he started having difficulty at school, pulling away from friends, sports and all of the things he normally loved to do. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of our story. On February 13th, with no previous warning, Hendrix began shaking uncontrollably, slurring his words and making jerky, uncoordinated movements. His eyes were dilated and he was exhibiting the signs and symptoms of a stroke, brain tumor, or a seizure disorder. As you can imagine, even though Jalayne is an RN, we were very scared, especially since Hendrix himself asked to go to the hospital because he could not control his own body. We drove him to the ER, but on the way Hendrix became extremely confused and did not remember where we were going or why. By the time we saw a doctor, Hendrix returned to normal and after a short assessment, he was discharged. Unfortunately, over the next week, Hendrix deteriorated rapidly and was unable to attend school and both of us were unable to go to work.  On the night of the 22nd, Hendrix became so unhinged that we called 911 and left for the ER in restraints in an ambulance. Two hours later, he returned to normal and the hospital discharged him again with nothing more than another basic exam. The next morning, we took Hendrix back to his pediatrician’s office and begged for help and for them to admit him to the hospital for further testing. Finally, Hendrix was admitted to the hospital for three days. After his tests showed relatively normal/benign results, we were told that our son was medically cleared and that we had a behavior issue on our hands and he was discharged. Three hours after that discharge, we had to call 911 again because Hendrix became worse than ever before.  Once again we arrived to the hospital via ambulance with Hendrix on a stretcher. We requested readmission to the medical floor for further testing, but our request was denied since Hendrix had just been medically cleared. We were then advised that the best place for him was the psychiatric unit. We spent three days and two nights in the ER with him waiting for a room to open up on the psychiatric unit. As you might imagine, there are no words to explain the stress, confusion, despair and guilt we felt during that time. Knowing this was a medical issue, we agonized over the best thing to do for our son and ultimately decided to follow our instincts and asked to be discharged immediately.  We returned home and at this point were now in the middle of a full-blown crisis. Our family was completely overwhelmed. It has been devastating for us to helplessly watch the Hendrix we know and love decline and deteriorate physically, mentally, and emotionally right before our eyes. There are no words to describe the nightmare our family has been living. We just wanted our little boy back. After months of dealing with non-responsive caregivers here in California we chose to get on a plane and take Hendrix to the East Coast to see specialists at NYU and St. Peter’s Hospital at Rutgers. So many wonderful souls went out of their way to help us with this complicated, expensive and risky journey traveling across the country with a very sick child. Thankfully the trip was the right decision because Hendrix has finally been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis (along with PANS and Neuropathy) and received his first treatment infusion of IVIG on May 11th just in time for his 10th birthday.  Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain. The doctors believe that the walking pneumonia infection triggered Hendrix’s body to attack his brain causing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as cognitive, memory and movement dysfunction. Hendrix has been plagued with a wax and wane of debilitating symptoms including memory loss, confusion, severe separation anxiety, hallucinations, altered personality and behavior, psychosis, movements that he cannot control, clumsiness, difficulty walking, talking, chewing and swallowing, auditory/sensory issues and sleep disturbances. Basically, his brain is on fire, resulting in a sickness that is nearly impossible to describe. Because of this, we have not been able to leave Hendrix’s side, he has not been able to return to school and we both have been unable to return to work. The positive news is that many children have recovered from encephalitis and the brain has an amazing potential to heal. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment greatly improves his chances of improving. That said, we have a very long and difficult road ahead for all of us. Hendrix needs multiple infusions and extensive cognitive, physical and psychological therapy and at this point we do not know when we will be able to return to work. It's a very scary situation to face.  We continue to live day-by-day and sometimes minute-by-minute. Some days we see more of Hendrix and other days we wonder if we will ever have our son back. We remain positive and are ever hopeful that Hendrix will recover and we will not rest until we have tried everything to save him. We have come to realize that this is more than we can handle alone and are now reaching out to our friends and family asking for help in regards to Hendrix’s medical care and expenses.  We will be grateful for any donation but we completely understand if you are unable to contribute. Prayers for Hendrix and for our family are needed as well.  Thank you!  Beau & Jalayne",359,1.9k,15,367,3 months,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Jason is a light to those who know him; everything he touches feels brighter with his presence. And now it’s our turn to shine a light on him.In the summer of 2013, Jason went for a routine physical and came out with a stage 3 melanoma diagnosis… a battle that continues to this day.

Surgery followed, along with months of PET scans and close monitoring by a team of doctors. Through this all, Jason continued to work and support the family he loves.This spring, doctor’s confirmed Jason’s melanoma had come back with a vengeance (stage 4). As I write, his cancer has spread to his muscle tissue, brain, lungs and heart, and it’s wide-spread in his lymphatic system.

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them. Thank you very much.Dmitry.",429,1.2k,8,435,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Duodenal Atresia is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum (in the small intestine). It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. At one day old, Billy had emergency surgery to correct the “kink” in his small intestine. The surgery was successful though Billy spent 5 weeks recovering in the NICU.Fast forward 30 years later, Billy has been able to live life to the fullest. He graduated Dickinson College with a degree in English. Pursued his passion by attending and graduating Tribeca Film Academy in Chicago. Got his dream job at Cutters Studio working his butt off to become Editor, which he achieved January 2018. He met his best friend and the love of this life, Briggs. Not only did he convince his Southern Belle to move from Atlanta to Chicago but he quickly knew to never let her go and married her on March 28th, 2015. I know Billy would still say that was the best day of his life. Until this year. On March 21st, 2018, Briggs and Billy welcomed their beautiful daughter Ann (Annie) Maynard Montross, named in honor of Annie’s grandmothers. If you asked anyone who knows Billy, they would say he is the nicest, kindest, most thoughtful and patient man they know. An accomplished film editor, golfer, hockey player, baseball player, artist, drummer, food enthusiast. I think my grandmother said it best when we were growing up, Billy is the angel in our family. And he is the rock for his two girls, Briggs and Annie. On Thursday, May 24th, Billy admitted himself into New York Presbyterian Hospital suffering from severe stomach pains, soon to be discover it was stemming from his small intestine. Over the next week, Billy underwent 4 surgeries on his small intestine. The initial surgery was to remove the buildup of scar tissue; however, as his condition evolved and his body attempted to recover, his small intestine did not survive his surgeries. Billy is now left with approximately 2 inches remaining of his small intestine (for size reference, the small intestine can range from 9 feet to 35 feet). He is being administered TPN (total parenteral nutrition) through an IV to provide his body the essential nutrients, as he cannot eat or drink, and has a G tube connected to a colostomy bag to continually drain his stomach.He is still in the hospital in NYC. He is making progress with regaining his strength and we hope to have him home within the next week or so.  Billy, Briggs, Annie and the Montross family has been so appreciative of people’s love, support, thoughts and prayers over the past month. Billy has a very long road ahead of him. Thank you for visiting and please keep checking back. All donations made on Go Fund Me will go to assist in paying for Billy's medical bills / small intestine transplant.

This was followed by a setback, when an artery in his brain burst and caused localized bleeding in the surrounding tissues. Doug is currently in rehabilitation hospital in Denver. He was released there after two weeks at the hospital. He is expected to return home for continued therapy there  on April 20th. From there it is expected he will have months of therapy before there is hope of a full recovery.Many of you know Doug as a long-standing Aspen Valley resident and manager of Rustique. Anyone who knows Doug knows him as a generous and kind person. My sister and I are so lucky to have him as our brother, he's always there for support and encouragement. He selflessly offered his time and energy to take care of our mother after her medical problems, taking her into his home. Recently he has had such happiness come into his life- a beautiful fiancé named Nok, a growing family (four kids), a new house, a new baby and an exciting new job as a Director of Food and Beverage for a hotel in the Snowmass area.  This stroke can be devastating for Doug and his family. Doug is a fighter!

He was 24 and newly married to his wife, Amanda. By the grace of our loving Lord, he enjoyed almost three years of clear scans. As of November 2017, Matt has been in another intense treatment phase. The tumor has regrown and for the moment, continues to grow. BUT GOD. He is making ways in the wilderness, streams in the wasteland. (Isaiah 43:19). We serve a miracle-working God who has already payed the price for our salvation and our healing. (1 Peter 2:24) The unconventional treatment that Matt is in now offers a lot of hope. It is a 12-hour a day job for both he and Amanda, but it is where God has led them, and that is all they need to know to stay on the path He has directed. He is currently into the newest protocol which includes 140+ pills a day, 96 ounces of fresh-pressed juice, multiple doctor’s appointments each week, ongoing consults with doctors across the southeast and outside of the country. The treatments being pursued are not covered by insurance and the costs are staggering. But God always provides. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.” - Matthew 10:29-31 Be steadfast in prayer. We believe we are weeks, days, even minutes away from seeing complete healing in Matt’s body. And that may sound crazy, BUT we know He has already commanded it. He is able and willing. God doesn’t change. He is the same God he was in the Bible. His love for Lazarus, the leper, the blind man, is the same as His love for Matt. He doesn’t deny help or any good thing to those who walk uprightly. (Psalm 84:11) Matt and Amanda do not view the costs of his treatment as anyone else's responsibility but our their own and should people choose to bless us financially, any amount is seen as the greatest gift.

Whether it be his podcast The Shoot, his YouTube channel, or his Instagram, Matt has been promoting, educating, and sharing his love of photography for years. He’s given so much to the photographic community at large, and now it’s time we showed our appreciation and gave back to him.I could try and explain what’s going on, but I think it’s best if it came from Matt’s wife Molly herself:“As many of you know, Matt has had a rough few weeks. I just wanted to get the full story out there to fill in the gaps:Last Friday (6/29/18), he told me he had a migraine. When I got home from work Sunday morning, he apparently had been vomiting all night and couldn't tolerate loud sounds or any light, so I took him to the ER for some fluids and a migraine cocktail. This helped for a while, but that night he started to have fevers. By Tuesday, the headache was worse and he had been consistently vomiting and not voiding, so he went back to the ER where he was treated for dehydration and they considered a lumbar puncture, but decided against it at that time and sent him home. He continued to have high fevers at home, and on Wednesday afternoon, he came out of our room and was covered in a rash and confused. I took him back to the ER and he ended up being admitted. All night his vitals were off. He received lots of fluids to bring his blood pressure up and his heart rate down. He had to be placed on a cooling blanket to bring down his fever. He was eventually moved to the ICU stepdown unit where he has been ever since to closely monitor him. Infectious disease is confident that this is a result from either a tick-borne illness or West Nile virus. He has received doxycycline for the tick illnesses. He is experiencing quite a few complications. He now has pneumonia, a UTI, and inflammation in his brain. His vitals are better now, but today he is experiencing some neurological symptoms that are concerning, so he will be transferred to Riverside. He is stable and talking, he just needs a higher level of care at this point. Thank you so much to all of my wonderful coworkers who have given him THE BEST care. Thank you to all of our friends and family for your help with kids and animals. Thank you for all of your prayers and good vibes sent. He certainly needs them right now. ❤️”Thoughts and prayers are certainly appreciated, but I know we can do more for the Day family right now. The medical expenses for Matt’s treatment and hospital visits are tough on any family, so let’s rise up together and show some monetary support! I reached out to Molly to make sure she was okay with launching this and she has given her blessing. So donate knowing that all money will go right to the Day family.Any size donation/contribution will be appreciated. And if you can’t donate, please spread the word!

Jeremy and Joslyn were finally blessed with their first pregnancy in 2017 after about a year of fertility treatments because they weren’t conceiving on their own. Joslyn has wanted to be a mommy forever. Joslyn and Jeremy had their first child on Monday 6/18/2018, but it was not the fairytale birth and celebration that every parent hopes for. Joslyn had to be induced early (about a month) and during the preparation for induction, Joslyn began having severe breathing issues. She lost consciousness and she flatlined for 15 minutes. They were able to get the baby out within five minutes of Joslyn flat-lining. Both mom and baby are fighting hard for their lives. Joslyn remains in an induced coma to allow her brain and body to heal from all the trauma. Baby is also in an induced coma. Both mom and baby are stable at this time, but the prognosis is still completely up in the air at this point. Staying in the hospital in ICU and NICU for a day is insanely costly and both Joslyn and baby have been in the hospital about five days now.

It was determined the bacteria entered her system through an ear infection she had been battling.  As of today, August 9th, she remains in a coma.  My sister Kristen is the loving mother of two young children Rylie age 9 & Grayson age 5. Together with her husband James, they lived a simple life in the hills surrounding Waynesville, North Carolina. With simple means, they lived in a rental house they’ve made their own. With what they lacked in means, they made up with love. The four of them are inseparable, and now tragedy has struck their lives.  It’s been two weeks now, and Kristen remains unresponsive.  With her family by her side, her doctors are not giving up hope for improvement.To make matters worse, last night, August 8th, as rains continue to fall in Western North Carolina, a massive tree fell on their home making it uninhabitable. They are now homeless. While their mother lays in bed unaware, her two children and husband face another setback. They need help. They need housing.  I'm starting this page because people have been calling me and asking ""what can I do?""  As someone who has always tried to help organizations and causes in my community, I am now asking the community for help back.  Any help you can give will help us secure a temporary rental for James and the children, pay medical bills that will mount and bring some sense of normalcy back to my niece and nephew's lives.  I leave this in your hands, the reader, to give what you can.  This tragedy has reminded me that family is first.  If there is any silver lining to this dreadful story, it's inspired me to be more present in my family's lives.  Let this be a lesson for all of us.  God bless.  Thank you.",430,1.0k,5,424,24 days,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,23,Help Matt Cremen,https://www.gofundme.com/help-matt-cremen,"Bronxville,","July 18, 2018","$45,000","$48,585","Back in June of 2016, little did Matt know that life as he knew it would change forever. Now, Matt needs an Intestinal Transplant.Matt has been diagnosed with a condition called myopathic pseudo-obstruction .  This means that the smooth muscles that move food along in his digestive tract, have stopped working.  As a result, he can no longer eat and has daily episodes of extreme vomiting.  Since he cannot eat, he needs to be fed intravenously with TPN (Total Parental Nutrition) .  Each night he is hooked up to his TPN and it runs over the course of 12 hours, in order for him to live.While TPN is a lifesaver, it comes with some serious long term complications.  TPN is extremely hard on the liver and many people that are on TPN for an extended amount of time will go into liver failure.  In addition, line infections are quite common (Matt has already had two) and can lead to sepsis.  Other health issues associated with long term TPN are developing osteoporosis, cholecystitis and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.The only “cure” for myopathic pseudo-obstruction, is an intestinal transplant.   An intestinal transplant  is the most complex and rare of all the organ transplants.  To give you an idea, last year there were only 109 intestinal transplants compared to 19,850 kidney transplants in the United States.  Due to it rarity and complexity, it is also the most expensive single medical procedure in the U.S., costing a whopping $1.2 million dollars.While Matt has health insurance that will cover the bulk of the medical expenses, there are many additional financial aspects of care and recovery, which are not covered by insurance.  He will spend the first five days in the ICU and is expected to be in the hospital anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks.  During this time his wife will need to take unpaid time off from work, especially in the very beginning.  Dana will be able to stay at a “transplant house” for the first few days after his surgery that is just blocks from hospital, but it is not free.  Once Matt is stable and moved from the ICU, Dana will return home to get back to work and be there for their two girls, Madison and Alexis.During the remainder of his hospital stay Dana and their daughters will commute into the city as often as possible to visit Matt.  Whether it’s by car or mass transit, the costs of going into the city will quickly add up.  Once Matt is finally discharged, he will be coming home on approximately 20 medications, which will cost around $1250 - $1,500 a month out of pocket.  He may also need in home nursing care, which is only partially covered by insurance.  Matt will also need to make weekly trips back into the city to ensure he is progressing and not having an issues with rejection or graft vs. host disease.  With intestinal transplants, there can be many ups and downs over the course of the first year and additional hospital stays are not uncommon.  In addition to the upcoming expenses, his existing medical bills are just under $8,000.  Thank you for considering donating, it's greatly appreciated! It doesn't matter how big or small the donation is, everything helps!",318,986,14,319,1 month,1 hour ago,26 days,2018-09-03

Steve is an inspiration to me and I’m sure to many of you as well. As many of you are aware, Steve and his wonderful family find themselves battling cancer for the third time. He’s been receiving monthly chemo/immunotherapy treatments at the Mayo Clinic since August 2017. While the treatments have stopped cancer growth in some areas, other areas continue to grow. As a result of genomic testing of the cancer, it was discovered that his cancer is most likely being driven by a specific mutation in the BRAF Gene. While there is no FDA approved targeted therapy for this specific BRAF mutation, MD Anderson is running a Phase 1 clinical trial with a drug that they believe has a chance to work on his cancer. Steve and Wendy traveled to Houston this week where he has been going through 3 days of multiple tests and a biopsy of one of the tumors. Fortunately, Steve has passed the screening and has been accepted into the trial that is testing the drug LXH254. This drug was developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. His first day on the trial will be Monday, April 16th. Steve and his family are grateful to his team of doctors at Mayo Clinic, who referred him to MD Anderson.While these treatments provide Steve with hope, they also bring forth tremendous costs, and I am hoping as a community we can assist the Rogers family in this battle against this awful disease. All funds raised will help with the living, travel, and out of pocket treatment costs the Rogers family will incur on this journey to defeat cancer for the final time!We will be updating the Post Hope website many of you are familiar with during Steve’s previous fight.  https://posthope.org/steve-rogers",172,158,4,171,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The Poulsen family received news that Chris had two masses in his brain and one in his lungs. After a biopsy and imaging, Chris was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic melanoma and has since began radiation treatment. Chris and Jenny have four beautiful children: Riley (16), Ashton (14), Aiden (11), and Anders (7). Everyone that meets Chris is struck by his warmth, gentle soul, and humility.
Chris worked for 10 years in the advertising industry. At 34, Chris decided on a career change and spent the next four years in dental school followed by a periodontal residency. Chris wanted to provide the best life for Jenny and their children. Of course, this came with great sacrifice for Chris and Jenny, not to mention hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans. 
In 2014, Chris purchased Post Falls Periodontics and has been tirelessly working to get the practice off the ground and establish a life  in North Idaho.  Chris was just beginning to make his mark in  the periodontal field and realize some return on his sacrifice and investment when the family received this terrible news. With his livelihood in jeopardy, it is uncertain how the family will cover the crushing medical bills that are sure to come, the rent on their home,  and basic day to day needs.

My wife Jules and I are shocked and saddened utterly devastated to announce that our lives have been completely upended by the discovery of what looks to be stage 4 neuroblastoma in our amazing 15 month old daughter Karin Quinn aka “Kiki.”Whether you call her Karin, Quinn, Kiki or Baby Q, the fact remains- she is amazing and uniquely fun, smart, and beautiful- our only daughter and the center of our world. On June 14, Jules and Barbara Dockery took Quinn to her pediatrician to check out whether Baby’s cute pot belly was anything to worry about.  He recommended an ultrasound to be sure. She immediately underwent an ultrasound procedure at Tarzana Children’s Hospital which revealed a large mass on her liver. Julie and Quinn were transported via ambulance to UCLA for admission. Here we remain. An MRI and CT scan revealed that Quinn has what appears to be a rare, aggressive and particularly lethal form of cancer known as neuroblastoma, an evil disease that lurks in healthy babies and then strikes. In diagnosing this disease, Kiki underwent two biopsies, one on the mass itself (about the size of potato, located next to her liver), and another sample from her pelvic bone. They are anticipating that the cancer has spread to her bones.  It will take more time to confirm this, but what is being discussed now is the reality of stage four neuroblastoma. This is as bad as it gets. In our future is the entire spectrum of aggressive cancer treatments. Our precious baby will be subjected to Chemo, radiation, surgery, stem cells, and possibly be brought to the brink of death in order to heal from this terrible disease.  No less than 3 lives are on the line. The outpouring of support we’ve received from our friends and family is incredible.  Many have asked what, if anything can be done to help. First, hug your loved ones and be kind to them. Second, donate blood, if you can. Third, send healing thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to baby Quinn. We really really need to catch a lucky break. Without prompting, Julie’s sister Crystal initiated this gofundme page in support of Kiki.  We are NOT expecting donations but we understand that for many, donating to be a part of Quinn’s fund will feel like a concrete step on the road to recovery, and we are grateful for the support.

This is a man who doesn't leave the house without singles in his pocket so that he always has something to give street performers or just someone in need. And now we're asking for that same spirit of generosity he shows everyone around him to be paid forward to Nikki and his growing family. Nikki and Annie are approaching this daunting year ""with as much hope, determination and positivity as possible.""  Let's help them keep positive and focused by lightening the load of medical bills, trips to the hospital, general expenses and possible time off from employment to focus on healing.  Prayers for a full and easy recovery are also deeply appreciated.  Thank you.",356,859,4,359,1 month,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

After numerous operations attempting to relieve the pressure in his brain, we find ourselves on the edge of our seats in the ICU. Because his pressures (both brain and blood) are still too high, the doctors have had him sedated throughout the process, and we have no idea as to what type of damage has been done to his brain and body. For those that don’t know, my dad has operated his own family run, small business for the last 20+ years as a Chiropractor, earnestly seeking to improve the quality of life of everyone he comes into contact with. Famous for providing more care for less money, dad did whatever it took to leave his patients better than he found them, while still providing for his family. However, because my family’s only source of income was my father’s business, we now need your help in this difficult time. As we continue to pray for a miracle, my mother has not left his side, and my brothers and I continue to do all we can to ease the pressures of this situation. Though the amount may seem high, the cost of care is already enormous, and even the most optimistic of outcomes leads to at least another 2-3 weeks of 24/7 care in the ICU.

He stole his parents’ hearts as well as many of his Instagram followers with his adorable personality and courageous attitude. At three months old, he underwent heart surgery to repair large hole in his heart. Doctors informed his parents that a second heart surgery would be necessary in two months in order to repair another hole located in his pulmonary valve. This repair will assist Noah with his breathing and overall quality of life. Noah’s parents are doing their best to provide all the necessities that he needs. They recently had him fitted for a cranial doc to repair the shape of his head which is due to his condition.

We live in The Colony, TX and decided to start his cancer treatment in Dallas, Texas in hopes that a few rounds of chemo would be the answer. After 3 rounds of BEP we thought we had the “all clear” but, just before Jan 2018, we found out that the cancer was back and had started to spread. We decided to seek a second opinion and made the drive to MD Anderson in Houston, TX for further treatment. They started Michael on an aggressive treatment of TIP chemo in hopes they could slow the cancer from spreading. After a week-long stay in the hospital we were discharged with the news that the TIP chemo was not effective. The doctors at MD Anderson suggested an RPLND surgery to physically remove all traces of the tumor.The RPLND surgery occurred on 4/13/18 and Michael recovered well. His blood work seemed to show we were cancer free. Towards the middle of May, Michael was having severe back pain accompanied with abdominal bloating. We traveled down to MD Anderson for the post-op appointments and found out Michael’s cancer was back and more aggressive than ever. They started Michael on chemo right away to try and slow down the cancer’s progression.Michael’s doctors at MD Anderson have told us that traditional cancer therapy (chemo, radiation, etc.) will not cure his cancer and that we should seek alternative therapy. We are currently working with a holistic doctor in Denver, CO to develop a treatment plan for Michael. Unfortunately, this alternative treatment is not covered by insurance, but Michael and I are willing to do whatever it takes to find a cure for his disease.

Medical,25,Juniper's Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/juniper039s-journey,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN","June 23, 2018","$15,000","$47,035","Juniper’s Journey:After meeting in college (CSB/SJU!), Colin and I became best friends and fell in love. From the early stages of our relationship, it became clear that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We got engaged in Alaska and had an amazing wedding nearly five years ago. We’ve been together for over ten years now. We’ve always dreamt that our life together would include children, and over two years ago, we started trying for our first child. That was a journey of its own...as many can attest to, we (naively) did not anticipate difficulty in conceiving a child. The morning after Thanksgiving in 2017, I was brushing my teeth and decided to take a pregnancy test. It was positive. Have you ever felt a joy so electric that it completely takes over every fiber of your being? This was that feeling, and that feeling continued to grow as baby grew too. At our 21-week anatomy scan, we found out that it’s a girl! Luckily, we had already agreed on the perfect name for our sweet summer daughter - Juniper.The days following that scan turned our happiness and excitement into what can only be described as primal fear. We received a very unexpected call that we would need to have a follow-up appointment with the maternal fetal medicine clinic for a level 2 ultrasound, as they were not able to get images of all four chambers of her heart at the anatomy scan. (Cue panic.) What resulted from the level 2 ultrasound raised more specific concerns regarding June’s heart, including a suspected diagnosis of heterotaxy. (Cue confusion and more panic.) We were then referred to the pediatric cardiology team at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, where a fetal echocardiogram revealed yet more details on Juniper’s congenital heart defects and provided us with a clearer pathway to treatment. The incredibly high quality of care we’ve been receiving at the University of Minnesota has helped bring some relief back into our lives; we know we are in great hands there. From what Juniper’s care team can currently determine (in utero), she has several congenital heart defects specific to her condition including HLHS/single ventricle, VSD, ASD, malposition of the great arteries and pulmonary atresia, in addition to her stomach being on the right side of her body. Essentially, this means that she will need a series of surgeries in order to maintain function of her heart and other organs to be able to live out her life like she very much deserves to do. Currently, she is projected to have four heart surgeries throughout her life...the first of which will happen soon after she is born. Since success of the first surgery will be dependent on a multitude of assessments made at birth, we are looking at a lengthy first stay in the hospital for recovery time before we can take our daughter home.The time we will both be able to spend with our new baby while she is in the NICU/CICU will be so important for many reasons; being present to make important medical decisions regarding her recovery and future outlook, gaining knowledge and skills to be able to care for her special needs in and out of the hospital, and of course, loving on her as much as is humanly possible.We’ve wanted this beautiful baby for so long and we have been saving up the best we can, though we could never have anticipated our version of parenthood to look quite like this. Though I am fortunate enough to have qualified for 12 weeks of FMLA leave and can use what little sick time I’ve accrued in my first year of teaching, the remainder is all unpaid. Colin can use some hours he’s saved up to take some paid time off, but he has recently been informed of an unexpected transition in position which has resulted in a reduction of pay. I had intended to teach summer school, but following the advice of our care team, I will instead take these last few weeks of pregnancy to focus on my health. Colin will be working overtime as he can in the weeks left leading up to June’s birth to help supplement our sudden change in income. We are navigating it all the best we can given the cards we have been dealt, but we anticipate that being in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time will prove challenging in more ways than one. During the months of my maternity leave following Juniper’s birth, we will undoubtedly face financial difficulty with bills coming in from all angles, month-to-month expenses on a single, reduced income, medical supplies and medications we will need when we make the transition home, hospital life (meals, parking, etc.), and very importantly, saving up for all of the above when we go through this yet again for future surgeries. We are being reminded, over and over again, that life never stops, even when you’re in desperate need of a pause button. If we could alleviate at least one of the difficulties our family will face in the uncertain times ahead, it could really help us adjust to our new normal in the long run, whenever that may be. If you know us, you know that we’ve put off setting up this GoFundMe for quite some time. (Turns out it is really difficult to ask for help when you’d much rather give it than put yourself out there to receive it...especially when it involves financial support.) But, after a lot of encouragement and strong suggestion from our loved ones in light of recent events, we decided to open it up and accept any and all assistance offered to us. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. We appreciate all of you.So much love from our family to yours,Chelsea and Colin Clark",256,876,15,258,2 months,14 hours ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Nathaniel set off to hike and climb Forbidden Peak, a famous climbing destination in the North Cascades. During his climb, he fell over 150 feet and sustained a severe spinal cord injury. Due to the actions of his climbing partner and another pair of climbers, Nathaniel was safely airlifted off the mountain to Harborview Medical Center. He underwent a successful surgery to stabilize his injuries, but the current prognosis is still dire - due to the damage on his C2-C7 vertebrae, he initially had no sensation or mobility below his neck.  But we’ve been witnessing small miracles this week, as he is now able to move his left arm, so we’re still hopeful for more improvements. He is currently still in the ICU, and is unable to breathe on his own at this time. Nathaniel had just completed his first year at the Dental School at the University of Washington, and he was passionate about many subjects and his thirst for exploration pushed him to pursue a life in the outdoors. He spent many hours in the calmness and beauty of Washington’s wilderness and climbing areas. Our hopes and dreams as a family is that he may one day return to the great outdoors.

Medical,25,Colleen Stevens &  Family,https://www.gofundme.com/colleenstevens,"SPRINGFIELD, IL","March 18, 2018","$50,000","$46,990","Colleen is a 34 year old mother of three young children ages 6, 4, 1 and is married to her loving husband Joe.  On January 31, 2018, she went into respiratory arrest due to a very rare autoimmune disease called Wegener's Granulomatosis.  This caused a complete blockage in her airway that caused her to then go into respiratory arrest and caused an ischemic stroke.  She was in ICU for several days and then admitted into the hospital for weeks where she lost her ability to speak, was blind for several days, lost movement of her legs and hands.  She was finally moved to the physical therapy floor of the hospital where she worked to regain her speech, learned to walk again, and was regaining her movement in her hands, legs, and vision was slowly coming back.  After 27 days, she was released to go home and entered out patient therapy.  We thought this was the end of her hospital story,  and we were looking forward to watching her regain her independence back....but it wasn't even close to the end of the story.Last Saturday, Colleen's husband Joe rushed Colleen to the ER with shortness of breath and another restricted airway.   She was released and the following day they headed to St. Louis to see her specialist at Barnes Hospital.  On their way, Colleen had ANOTHER blockage of her airway and her husband had to perform the Heimlich Maneuver to move the large obstruction.  Her specialist put her on high dosage of steroids to try and help the blockages that were forming.  They went home and the next morning (TUES.) she woke up and felt like her airway was BLOCKED again.  We took her to the ENT where she was checked and released but two hours later felt that the blockage was still there.  We took her back to the ENT where they discovered a 98% blockage was below her vocal cords not above them as we have always thought.  She was immediately rushed into surgery and released the next day to go home on Wednesday.  By Thursday morning, she again woke up at home to a feeling of another blockage of her airway.  We rushed her to the ER, where they discovered another blockage under her vocal cords. These blockages were being removed and coming back within 24 hours and blocking her entire airway.  They immediately took her for her SECOND surgery and put her into the hospital to be monitored 24 hours a day.  They gave her high doses of steroids hoping that might help but by Friday morning these blockages were back and Colleen was going in for her THIRD surgery in THREE days.At this point, we were devastated by this news.  We needed help.  Her doctors at Memorial Hospital and her doctor at Barnes were working together to find out as much as possible regarding Wegener's and what could be done to help her.  Her doctor at Barnes was able to contact doctors at Harvard and Cleveland to find out some good information on treatment. By Saturday morning, Colleen had her FOURTH surgery in FOUR days to remove yet ANOTHER blockage.  After a lot of discussions by the doctors at Memorial, Barnes, Harvard, and Cleveland they removed the blockage and also injected steroids and topical chemotherapy into the trachea.  They also started Colleen on a chemotherapy drug, which will be given once a week for four weeks to try and help her.  She will continue to be in the hospital so that they can monitor her 24 hours a day and be sure she has a clear airway daily and hope that the chemotherapy treatment along with the steroid injections all work together to put her Wegener's in remission.  Colleen's husband Joe has been out of work for over a month now and will continue to have to stay with her until the doctors give the okay for her to go home.  They are going to need to add a system to their two home heating and air systems that adds moisture into their house.  The stress alone of being in the hospital away from your kids would make it hard on any family and then add in regular bills, the doctors bills and the continued physical therapy Colleen will still need when she does come home, and the heating/air system that is essential for her to have that this family just needs some help from family, friends, and maybe even the kindness of strangers.  So many of you have reached out to help, so I think this would be a great way to help alleviate some of the stress that the Stevens family  has due to this horrific disease that has turned this family's world upside down. Thank you to all those willing to help them during their time of need.",451,925,5,455,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

The most devastating was to see that all of the cancer was sitting on her aorta which made the procedure life-threatening if they continued. With top experts on the phone from all over the county, and those in the operating room, the collective decision was to not proceed and leave everything as is. Onto the next treatment plan she went which included more chemo as soon as her body was able to handle it.One can only imagine how strong the fight is, and has been. And if you know anything about the Torosyan family, you know what a unit they are. Through the aftershocks, much time has been taken from work to focus on what is most important - family, and the time spent together supporting one another.Many have asked how they can join in their support.

I have been suffering debilitating motor symptoms including tremors, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems as a result of Early Onset Parkinson’s Disease for many years. During this time I have continued to work full time to provide for my son John's care and multiple therapies as he grows up with autism.  Just recently, I have taken advantage of a small window of opportunity to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure for Parkinson's patients that requires several steps, each with mounting medical expenses.  A battery-operated device is implanted in the chest (similar to a pacemaker) to deliver electrical stimulation to the areas of the brain that control movement. The hope is that ultimately, I can continue to be an active participant in John’s life.   On June 19, 2018, the first surgery was successfully performed where a thin, insulated wire was inserted into my skull and implanted in the brain. On July 3, an implantable pulse generator (IPG) will be implanted in my chest. The IPG will then be programmed to block abnormal electrical signals and alleviate the Parkinson’s Disease motor symptoms.  I have developed this GoFundMe Page to help offset some of these out-of-pocket expenses.Please forward this email and link to anyone I might have forgotten.  Thank you so much for your generous donation.",185,175,3,189,2 months,1 month ago,1 month,2018-09-03

It was VERY big, so big I was a few days away from it crushing my heart and causing it to stop.I need to get radiotherapy to ensure the cancer doesn´t return BUT, radiation to the chest (mediastinum) has a high probability of causing heart disease and secondary tumors--cancers caused by radiation that pop up 10-20 years after receiving the radiotherapy. I discovered that the most advanced form of radiotherapy is called ""Proton Therapy"" which reduces exposure to radiation of healthy tissue, almost eliminating the toxicity of traditional radiotherapy and it´s side-effects. There are very few places around the planet that offer it (less than 50 as far as I can tell) which makes it extremely expensive. I´ve found a place in northeastern Italy which does it for a fraction of what it costs in the US and other places.I need the funds ASAP so I can secure my spot, since I need to start treatment on August 16th, 2018.  I am 48 years YOUNG! and a father to a sweet, loving and smart 3 year old boy and husband to my beautiful and wise wife, and I NEED TO BE AROUND FOR MANY DECADES MORE!I´ve spent the last 32 years of my life doing my best to help people learn how to have more fulfilling lives, and I feel like I´ve just gotten started.

In Connor's 10 short years on this earth, he touched more lives than most of us will in the 7 or 8 decades we are given. Connor suffered a ruptured AVM (brain) three weeks ago. In true Connor form, he miraculously was recovering from what most people die from. His mother, Alaina, used her fast-acting mom and nurse skills to contribute to the early interventions that gave him a fighting chance. Unfortunately, Connor developed a fast-acting pneumonia while hospitalized which spread to his bloodstream (sepsis).   Connor was re-intubated and once again fighting for his life. The NJ hospital recognized the critical nature of this illness and accepted they could no longer care for a child this ill. Connor was helicoptered to CHOP where they did everything they could to save his life. Due to lack of oxygen from multisystem organ failure (to make a long story short), Connor's brain suffered. Alaina and Dan made the hardest decision of their lives which was to end Connor's suffering and chose to save the lives of other children by donating Connor's organs. Heroes....an understatement. All of them. As my best friend and hero-mom is preparing to bury her only son, this go-fund-me has been established to help her with Connor's medical bills (3 weeks in the ICU at various hospitals not to mention a helicopter transfer), help with funeral costs (which no mother should have to endure), and help get her and her daughter, Brianna, back on their feet after enduring every mother's worst nightmare. Alaina, a single mother, has been out of work this whole time, and quite frankly deserves time with her daughter to heal and find a ""new normal"" once life calms down. Any help you can give is much appreciated. Trust me when I tell you, kindness is contagious and Alaina will surely give your kindness back to the word once her life calms down. My Baby Connor ..... you are our hero. We love you and miss you so much already.",421,1.1k,7,419,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

He also has a significant hole between the right and left ventricles as well as an enlarged pulmonary artery. Shortly after birth, Oakley had his first heart surgery where a stint was put on his artery, which was a temporary fix to give more time for his heart to grow bigger and stronger. He has now outgrown this stint and underwent his second open heart corrective surgery on May 25th at Boston Children's Hospital (a few days shy of his 1st birthday on May 31) in order to reroute the arteries and patch the hole. Early signs are that the surgery was successful and he is now beginning a long recovery process which will include an extended stay at the hospital for up to a month.  It has been an emotional and trying time for MaryEllen and her husband Shant, but they are doing their best to remain optimistic and praying for the best possible outcome. In response to the outpour of concern from many family and friends asking ""How can I help?"" knowing the amount of surgical expenses from little Oakley's first surgery still piling up and the inevitable amount of bills that will continue to come in that are not covered by insurance, we wanted to provide you all with this path to direct your love and support.

She has had at minimum 10 spinal taps to inject chemo into her spinal fluid to ensure the Leukemia can never travel to her spine and/or brain.  She has spent many a night in the hospital due to fever, dehydration, regular viruses that you and I could fight off easily and a terrible bout with c-diff. Emelina is doing amazing and has gone through all of this like a true warrior princess.  Her happiness and spunk are and always have been in full effect.  Her prognosis is wonderful and at the end of this journey she will be a happy, healthy, thriving 5 year old.  Please consider donating to her fight and to the family to aid in her hospital bills and travel expenses, as they will continue on this journey for the next two years.  No child should ever have to endure this and no parent should have to watch his or her child go through this without any control to take the pain away.  Thank you so much!!! #EmmatheBrave",388,735,20,391,1 month,6 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Doctors told his parents that this was not to be worried about but that they would do another scan in 5 years to check that it hadn't grown. About 2 months ago, Mikey asked if he could try out for football. His mom insisted that he couldn't until another MRI was done to check on his aneurysm. She had some convincing of his medical team to do because she wanted the scan done earlier than they had recommended but they got it done. What they discovered was an absolute shock... there was a new aneurysm, a fuseiform aneurysm in the basilar artery (middle of the brain stem) which was significantly larger in size than his original carotid artery aneurysm. His doctors and parents worked to figure out a plan for almost a month for this rare and difficult diagnosis. His parents were advised to come back in 3 to 6 months to do another check-up and discuss putting in a stent instead of risking surgery to remove the aneurysm from this delicate location.4 days later, on July 4th, Mikey suffered a stroke in his brain stem from a blood clot that had formed. No one could see the blood clot in CTs or an MRI until they did a CT with an angiogram and by then the damage was done. The doctors said it happened within 5 minutes and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. Mikey has been in the ICU ever since.He has now been diagnosed with Locked-In Syndrome with paralysis. This means that the damage done by the stroke in his brain stem has paralyzed him to the extent of no longer being able to move anything except his eyes, and only vertical movement and blinking at that. This is a paralysis that is rare and is unlikely to resolve. The Plan (so far) To provide him with any encouragement and support to recover any of his voluntary muscle movement that he can, (especially in his face and throat). Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy as soon as possible are a must in encouraging any of this recovery.His mom and step dad (Dezaree and Matt Corwin) are already working out the details to renovate their home so that Michael can come home and have the space and access for his supplies and comfort that he needs AFTER he has grown strong enough to be discharged from the ICU and successfully completes a stay in rehabilitation.However, there will be tremendous unforseen costs moving forward with Michael's care that include everything from communication devices, therapies, rehabilitation, etc.Can you help?Any amount of donation and/or support you can give is appreciated more than we can express. Or if you know of anyone or any treatment that we can look into to help our boy, please share your stories with us!PLEASE pass this information along to family, extended family, best friends, friends, friends of friends, charities, do-gooders, etc. in the area and beyond to put their positive vibes, prayers, experiences and donations toward this mighty feat to help our family provide the best support and comfort to him that we can in this life-changing moment.All you have to do is click the donate button above and/or share this link through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, text, etc. Thank you so much, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.#unshakeableMikeyTrent #Mikeystrong",550,4.8k,38,534,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I started working with him, helping on bids and project management, trying to learn everything I could from him.He poured his heart and soul into his work; he cared more than anyone I have ever met. Anyone that knew Shea, knew that when he was right, he was right, and wouldn’t back down. He was warrior in his work and his life. And all the while, he lit up the room with his smile and warmed it with his kindness. As many know, Shea was diagnosed with a brain tumor in the Spring of 2012.He went through countless surgeries and chemo treatments, yet continued to work throughout it all.I’m pretty sure he had some kind of superman powers. But work was what he loved to do.This spring Shea’s cancer took a turn for the worse.He fought to continue, refusing to take rest or leave. He fought until he literally was unable to speak, until he physically could no longer work.In all his stubborn relentless commitment to his work, he cared more about contributing to the success of our division.To make matters worse, he was unable to qualify for any coverage due to his then established illness.As such, Shea and his family have had to fight this battle without any medical assistance whatsoever. Now, despite all his efforts to continue, he is no longer able to support himself or his family.Shea’s wife, Tasha, and their family need to be with him 24/7 now.With this little time Shea has left, there are medical costs accumulating. Shea is a strong, proud, hard-working man that would never ask for your assistance or support. Which is why I am. The hours we work, the heart and soul we pour in to these demanding roles, our work life is our family life, and Shea is family. I’m hoping that we all can come together as family, to help Shea, Tasha and his loved ones in covering the expenses this illness is costing them so they can focus on providing him with the love and support he deserves in his final days.I’m not asking for much, every little bit helps. All I ask is that you consider what it would be like if you were in his shoes, and show some compassion for a man that gave everything he had to help us all succeed.",189,226,0,190,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Medical,28,Kelsey and baby Maxley,https://www.gofundme.com/kelsey-and-baby-fergie,"PRIOR LAKE, MN","June 10, 2018","$100,000","$44,200","My sister, Kelsey, has been through more devastation in the last year than some people deal with in a lifetime.  First, Kelsey and Scott started trying for a baby as soon as they got married in March 2016, but after a year of negative pregnancy tests, they sought the help of a doctor who eventually put Kelsey on fertility meds.  Amazingly they helped and Kelsey was pregnant in July 2017.  Unfortunately in  August 2017, Kelsey and Scott got their first devastating news, they had lost the baby at about 9 weeks.  Kelsey went back on her meds when she was given the all clear from her doctor, and they were lucky to conceive again quickly. They announced to friends and family in November that they were expecting again, due in late July 2018.  They celebrated cautiously knowing what had happened the last time.  When they hit the 20 week mark, they felt relief having made it that far, and announced they were having a boy!  However during their 20 week ultrasound, the techs were not able to get all the images they needed, so Kelsey and Scott needed to go back in at 24 weeks for a follow up ultrasound.  It was during that appointment that their world came crashing down.  They were told that the baby had a heart defect, and that the baby was measuring almost 4 weeks behind in size.  Those 2 items are symptoms of a couple chromosomal abnormalities, and the specialist told Kelsey and Scott that it was very likely that he had an abnormality that would be fatal.  Most babies are stillborn, and if they do happen to make it to term, they dont survive long outside the womb.  Kelsey and Scott were devastated.  They both wanted nothing more than to be parents, and had been trying for 2 years at this point to make that happen. Doctors ran blood tests that day, and for a week while they waited for the results, they thought their dreams of this baby were gone.  However those results ended up coming back negative/low risk of the 5 most common abnormalities.  Kelsey and Scott's dreams were reignited.  Doctors determined Kelsey's placenta was not working like it should, so that was most likely the reason the baby was measuring small.  They then transferred her to Abbott for future tests and appointments. She was told that most growth restricted babies require extra monitoring, and that at some point she could get admitted to the hospital for constant monitoring.  It would help them determine exactly when the right time would be to take the baby out.  The longer they wait, the healthier the baby, but then if they wait too long then the baby could die from lack of blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.  Kelsey continued monitoring for several weeks.  However the weekend of June 1, at 32 weeks, Kelsey wasnt feeling the babies movement as much, so doctors gave her a shot of steriods and told her she will most likely have the baby by 34 weeks. On Monday June 4, doctors decided that it was time Kelsey be admitted to the hospital.  Scott helped get her checked in, and went home that night.  At this point, Scott had been dealing with multiple symptoms over the last several weeks, cough, body aches, fever, joint pain, etc.  He had seen a couple doctors, and had tried a few meds, but nothing had helped, and no one seemed to be sure exactly what was going on.  They thought he had rheumatoid arthritis, all the symptoms fit, and he had an appointment set up for that Wednesday to start treatment.  After Scott left Kelsey on Monday night though, he went home and he was having a hard time breathing, he could not stop coughing, and he even started coughing up blood. He drove himself the the ER in Shakopee, and they did Xrays and thought it was pneumonia.  They decided to transfer him to another hospital to see a lung specialist, they gave him a choice of Methodist or Abbott, and since Kelsey was at Abbott, they transferred him up there.Once he got checked in there, doctors determined he had a rare autoimmune disease called Vasculitis or Wegeners, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. They started his treatment and on Wednesday he felt so much better.  Kelsey was able to visit him a few times a day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On Thursday however, Scott was still not able to get his oxygen levels up and was still having difficulty breathing.  They wanted to try a few procedures to help, including putting him on lung bypass to help give his lungs a break.  Unfortunately during that procedure, Scott suffered cardiac arrest.  They were able to resuscitate him after 45 min, and after a long while they were able to transfer him up to the Cardiac ICU.  Kelsey was able to be with him, but doctors told her they were not able to stop the bleeding into his lungs, and there wasn't anything else they could do.  Scott passed away just after midnight on June 8th, at just 30 years old.Kelsey was still in the hospital for her high risk pregnancy, and after regular monitoring 3 times a day over the weekend, on Tuesday June 12, doctors determined it was time for her baby to meet the world, just 4 days after his daddy had passed away.  Maxley Russell Ferguson was born via csection at 11:56am on June 12, 2018 and he weighed just 2 pounds 4 ounces.  They had warned Scott and Kelsey that the baby would most likely need to be resuscitated after birth and intubated to help him breath, but little Maxley came out crying and never needed anything to help him breath. He is thriving in the NICU and is just cute as a button.  He will be in the NICU for several weeks as he learns to grow and regulate his own temperature, and once he learns to eat consistently, he will be able to go home, though doctors think that will still be closer to his due date at the end of July.  He will still require heart surgery for his heart defect (which they had learned was an AV canal defect) but doctors anticipate that surgery will be when Maxley is about 4-6 months old.What Kelsey is having to deal with right now, no one should have to go through that.  The birth of your child should be the best time of your life, instead, she is having to mourn the loss of her husband, plan a funeral, and care for her preemie baby in the NICU.  That is a lot for any one person to have to deal with. And obviously with the death of a spouse and parent, several financial burdens come with that.  This campaign is here to help my sister with all that comes with raising a child on her own, daycare costs, bills, not to mention the funeral costs that will come, and a new mortgage as Scott and Kelsey had JUST bought a new house in March after renting an apartment for several years, they wanted a home to raise a family in.Please consider donating what you can to help Kelsey and baby Maxley.  We cant take Kelsey's pain away, but we can help prevent additional burdens by helping her financially.Please visit both caring bridge pages for more detailed information for both Scott and baby Maxley. https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/scottrussellferguson https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/babyfergie",656,3.6k,7,616,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

As everyone knows, Eric is just shy of 31 years old, looks like he is in the best health, always has a smile on his face, and has an energy about him that leaves an impression on everyone he meets. At the beginning of the year, Eric started developing pains in his abdomen and back. He started feeling tired and then caught a cold. They called/met with their doctor and got a z-pac for his symptoms. The cold went away. A week later, the pain started again and nausea developed. We thought it was his pancreas or gallbladder. After going to the ER they ran tests and said everything was fine, except a small mass that appeared in his liver that was  about 4 cms. They then met with a liver doctor and decided it would be best to get a biopsy and proceed with a liver resection if in fact it was a tumor while operating. During his surgery, the mass was found to be cancerous and when the doctor went in further he discovered multiple tumors and was diagnosed with Cholangiocarcinoma. The doctor could not resect the tumors due to the severity of it spreading. Eric and Danielle have been married just under 4 years and thought that IVF was their journey, however, God had other plans. While in the hospital recovering from his major surgery; Eric and Danielle found out for the first time in 3 years, that they were going to be parents. This was his first sign of hope to motivate him through his journey!Currently, Danielle and Eric are meeting with a team of doctors to determine the best treatment plan.  Eric needs to begin chemotherapy immediately in hopes to shrink the tumors to give the doctors an opportunity to go back in and resect areas of his liver.

As most of you know, she is a bass player extraordinaire/singer and we started actually by playing ukeleles together as kids in the Philippines, and singing our hearts out (we are Philippine-Amercan). We moved to acoustic guitars, and then electric instruments with a band in high school (Sacramento, the 60's!). That morphed into the band Fanny, and although our paths diverged a few times, neither of us ever stopped playing. I just need to say that Jean is a national treasure in my opinion - few people can play as she does. And sing, while playing bass!When she had her stroke, it was also discovered that she has diabetes (runs in the family). So her care is complicated - she's home now, but needs continued care and physical therapy. The house has needed to be retrofitted ... and so on. Please give when and as you can and let other people know. You might be surprised at who might already know of Jean Millington through her rich musical history - and/or will be delighted to know of how she's already contributed so much to our joy and happiness by playing with so many - both live and on recordings.A new album has just been released with bandmate (and high school pal from our band the Svelts!), Fanny Walked the Earth: that's Jean, me, and Brie Darling - we need to all go out there and play together again!With endless thanks,June Millington*A note to all our friends: Jean's daughter Marita is the stated beneficiary to make it easier to manage the funds you are so gracously and lovingly donating - it's a joint account, to be clear, and all the funds are directed in such a way that Jean is fully involved. So much thanks!*Photo of Jean during a Svelts (our high school all-girl band) photoshoot at Santa Cruz around Spring of 1968. We were living in a band house in Los Altos at the time, playing as much as possible and learning all the time. Some of the songs on our setlist? ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""Spooky."" We did it all! (oh, yes, ""the Letter"" and ""Funky Broadway,"" too - not bad, to cut your teeth on! We loved every minute of our wild, musical freedom.The house where it all started, Portola Way in Sacramento, CA - photo courtesy Tamara Reynolds.At first, we had a bedroom on the first floor with 2 single, metal beds. When we got a transistor radio in there, we started to learn songs on acoustic guitars - those hits of the day were fantastic! (""We'll Sing In the Sunshine"" and ""End of the World"" come to mind). Then, the attic was renovated just enough for me and Jean to move up and into, and with that our world changed - we had privacy! (it had a trapdoor you could pull up ...). We even had full-on band rehearsals up there, with drums! One of the songs? ""Do You Believe in Magic?"" SURE  we did - we were living it! Later, Fanny did gigs with John Sebastian - we're in touch still. Now, THAT's magic.By 1965, we had started our first all-girl band, the Svelts, with drummer Kathie and fellow folksinger (we switched to electric guitars and bass pretty quickly!) Cathy. SO fun and exciting ... from left: Jean, drummer Kathie Terry, June, and singer-guitarist- Cathy Carter.Several personnel changes later, the Svelts included Brie Darling (née Berry) - who quit a year later but kept playing with us off and on anyway! She ended up at with us in Hollywood at our band house Fanny Hill, and after I left the band in '73 played on the very last Fanny album that had Fanny's biggest hit: Jean's song ""Butter Boy."" Talk about a Long and Winding Road! (drummer Alice de Buhr left shortly after I did, and both Brie and guitarist Patti Quatro joined the band - it was with a different producer and record company, but the band definitely, as the saying goes,  played on). 49 years later we were recording as Fanny Walked the Earth at IMA, a non-profit organizaton for women and girls in Goshen, MA! Here, Jean is shown entering the Control Room where her son, Lee, was working as one of the engineers. We were doing vocals for ""Girls on the Road,""  a sort of song diary of the early Svelts days:""Let's go back to where it all began: 17, then we started a band. Lugging our gear up and down the stairs, making so much noise, we didn' really care! Girls on the road, Girls on the Go, doing what we knew was gonna save our souls ... Riding the wave, coming 'round the bend, onece you feel the beat you got to do it again."" That's absolutely ALL true, and I love those lyrics - they're true to the soul and spirit of our times.We had done so many gigs between '65 and '68 that we felt seasoned and confident, ready for anything that came along. After all, we could back up a trailer and set up a PA ourselves! In top photo left: Brie, June, Cathy and Jean pose as the Svelts just after a personnel change - our manager Dick pasted Brie'a head over Kathie's; the band had to go on and we had no money for promo!We always wanted to play!During out first ""International"" tour - the Svelts, that is. We were kind of having a hard time as Brie quit the band just before we were to set off, and we had no real drummer - here, in Winnipeg, we followed a topless band called ""8 of a Kind,"" who had four band members. I think everyone was so excited at the thought of another topless band (we were not:)) that they barely noticed we were missing a drummer - Jean and Addie Clement, who was also in the Svelts for years (she tore it up on lead guitar and vocals) in their hotel room, in the doldrums. What was gonna happen? This was around July 1967.The Svelts, late Spring 1968 - our house in Los Altos. A nice moment, from left: Wendy Haas (keyboards/vocal), Jean, Brie, and June. Photo by Steve Griffith, thank you.The Svelts, late summer 1968 - nothing would stop us! By now, we'd magically  morphed into the group Wild Honey. In tree,  from left: Alice de Buhr, drums; Jean, bass/vocals ; Wendy, keyboards/vocals; June, rhythm guitar/vocals; and Addie Clement, lead guitar/vocals.Hollywood, finally! We got our record deal in the Fall of '68 with Richard Perry, producer/Reprise Records, and loved our house just above Sunset Strip (dig the landlord's castle, just beyond, complete with courtyard). Who cared about the smog? We promptly scoured the floors, cleaned the basement, installed lava lamps and candles down there with our equipment as a rehearsal lair, and named the house Fanny Hill - as soon as we re-named the band Fanny, which didn't take long. It was a girl's name, and we were gonna conquer the world!

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoLvdnToHMgA portion from my audiobook ""Land of a Thousand bridges,"" my autobiography. Here, I'm going to UC Davis'66-'67, in a band and learning theory for the first time.Ah well, for some reason I can't get that clip to play, but you got the link! Here's our very first busness card, created by the boy who sat in front of me in biology class at McClatchy High in Sacramento, where we'd moved from Manila in 1961. I wish I remembered his name!p.s. the best compliment we got back in those days was ""Not bad for chicks!"" We just smiled and dug in harder ...I love this shot - we literally climbed outside the back windows at Fanny Hill (it had been Hedy Lamar's house - believe me, electric! (look her up as an inventor) ...One of our very early rehearsals in the Fanny Hill living room - Jean bass, Alice de Buhr drums, June guitar. The doors behind us opened up to the porch that overlooked Sunset Strip just beyond. (this would be circa 1969).We would play our hearts out, anytime day or night. Here, we're tightening up an arrangement before heading down to the Whiskey a Go-go (not far from Fanny Hill, maybe 15 blocks down the strip) to play that night. From left: Nicky, Jean, Alice and June.When Nicky Barclay joined the band, pretty soon we were joined by piano and a B-3 organ. Our sound just kept getting bigger and bigger!As we hit the road in 1971, press was as important as people hearing us on records. Next: for them to hear and see us LIVE. Promotion was handled by Derek Taylor,  press officer to the Beatles who was at the time on leave and mostly in LA. He was for a time known as the ""Fifth Beatle,"" and I wouldn't argue with that. Truly one of the most iconic and magical people I ever met. (June)We did it all! Look Magazine, and ironic that we're looking through bars. We needed to bust through! From left: Jean, Alice, Nicky, and June.Jean practicing backstage at the BBC set for the Old Grey Whistle test, Dec 1971. We did the song ""You're the One,"" and people went crazy - even today, the reaction is off the charts. No wonder, it's starts with a closeup of Jean on her bass! We always made sure we warmed up before every appearance, whether live or on television. Playing Fanny material is not for wimps!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukOcZ4Tjk0To hear Fanny backing Barbra live on ""Where You Lead,"" pls go to  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGA_Abhvnc - you can hear Jean and me contibuting to the backup vocals at Verse 2: ""whoo-ooh-ooh""s. Definitely the Millington vocal sound!IN THE EARLY DAYS, THE BEST WE HEARD FROM AUDIENCES WAS ""Not bad for Chicks!"" BY THE TIME WE GOT TO PLAYING SCOTLAND, IN 1972, HORDES OF BOYS WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE STAGE CHANTING ""FAN-nny! ""FAN-nny! ""FAN-nny!"" louder & louder. WE HADN'T REALIZED THAT WORD MEANT SOMETHING COMPLETELY IN THEIR WORLD! BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY, AND LAUGHED RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.  AS LONG AS THEY WERE BUYING RECORDS ...More of that vocal sound on Ella Fitzgerald's version of ""Ooh Baby Baby""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pLTQAXx61E - 1969, and not only did we sing on this (with some earlier members of Fanny, which was called Wild Honey at the time), we watched her do the vocal. Early days LA for us, and meeting such an amazing singer, and public figure, who was so humble and real ... was a transcendent experience (we had the same producer, Richard Perry). THAT - is how you learn to record. xxJust as the first Fanny album was getting ready to be released, we did warm-up gigs to the big tours ahead, around LA. Here, at Knottsberry Farm.Jean at far left, mugging with our mom, our brother Richard and me on an outing in the Philippines, sometime in the 50's.40 years later, rehaearsal with our bad the ""Slammin' Babes,"" in Bodega California! Those were fun times. (photo karen Semanek, thank you)Guess who? We spent so much time in airports, finally we just started mugging on the median strips!Jean with Danny Blakkolb, who'd popped by during a break from Vietnam. So, bopping around and going to music stores Hollywood? Heaven. Danny was the bass player in the Psy-kicks, with  whom we did a lot of gigs in Sacramento: same age, different sexes. But we got along just fine! The music was the thing ... hip, hip, Hooray for the innocent '60's! xxIt took a minute to get used to us ...When we got to London in Dec 1971 to record ""Fanny Hill"" at the Beatles' Apple Studio, they would send a limo for us every day. Our lives sure changed!While we were getting our sound and tour chops together,  Reprise/WB assigned us empty movie lot stages in which to rehearse. Here, Alice Jean and Nicky during a break. We got a lot of work done! (Fanny, circa Fall 1970, photo Linda Wolf).Our mom always remained our staunchest supporter!

This has been the recurring question we all want to know. While the Heines have greatly appreciated everyone’s prayers, meals, cards, and healing thoughts, it is now time to move to the next step of helping them financially.Brian, husband to Julie, and father to Mackenzie and Maddie, has always been a vibrant, quick-witted,  full of life, fun man. He knows no strangers.  In mid-January, Brian was leaving for a business trip and slipped on a patch of ice in the airport parking lot. He landed on his back, but luckily was wearing a backpack which broke his fall. Immediately after, Brian started having neck pain and thought it was from the whiplash of his neck during the fall.  Two weeks passed. Brian woke up on a Saturday morning and noticed his walking gait was different.  A quick trip to the Urgent Care showed scans and bloodwork were clear.  The Urgent Care told Brian to call his physician to schedule an MRI.  The next day, Brian's walk didn't improve, so he went to the E.R.at Missouri Baptist. After a 3-hour MRI, the radiologist misdiagnosed the results as cancer that metastasized . Brian was admitted to the hospital.  Brian and Julie were devastated.  Luckily, Brian's sister found information online about how cavernomas (lesions that several of his family members have) are often incorrectly diagnosed as cancer. They immediately informed Brian's nurse of this information and she consulted the doctors. After reviewing the MRI scans again, Brian was correctly diagnosed with familial cavernous malformations. They found 2 cavernous hemagiomas/lesions attached to his spinal cord at C3 and C4 near the brainstem. In order to receive the best care, Brian was transferred to Barnes where the amazing neurosurgeon, Dr. Chicoine, performed surgery. Dr. Chicoine removed 80% of the C4 lesion, but didn’t feel it was safe to operate on the C3 lesion. Unfortunately, post-surgery, the C3 lesion bled and created many challenges for Brian.  He has remained in the ICU since January 29th and has since had several procedures following surgery including a pacemaker, breathing tube, tracheostomy, and feeding tube.  Currently, Julie is on a leave of absence from her teaching job to be by Brian’s side. She is Brian’s biggest cheerleader and advocate. Between the two of them, Brian and Julie have always been there for others organizing benefit trivia nights, securing silent auction donations, and emceeing the events. It is now our turn to give back to them as a family. Brian, the ultimate life of the party, is currently immobile and can only silently mouth words to communicate. They just received word that Brian will begin rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in Denver, which specializes in helping spinal cord patients..  Any gift you can give will greatly help to defer the cost of current and future medical bills, and living expenses. Thank you all in advance, and Let’s Cover Their “Heine”!Follow Brian's journey at:  https://brianheinerecovery.blogspot.com Add your comments on the blog and I will be sure to read them to Brian.  He will love hearing from all of his supporters!",324,952,3,327,5 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,28,Anna Jeter's Transplant Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/anna-jeter039s-transplant-fund,"EXCELSIOR, MN","August 4, 2018","$85,000","$44,140","On July 29th, Anna Jeter and her mother, Laurie, moved from their home in Minnesota to Palo Alto, California, so that Anna could be listed for a lifesaving heart-lung transplant. This is the only option left to Anna, after 19 years of living with Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). PH is a progressive and terminal illness that impacts both the lungs and the heart, growing more severe with time. Despite a daunting prognosis at the age of four, Anna was responsive to intravenous therapies, which are delivered directly to her heart through a central line 24/7. Although her health has instilled many significant limits upon her life, Anna’s days have been filled with faith, wonder, and community. After finishing high school, Anna’s illness continued to progress, and it became clear that her medications would no longer be enough to sustain her long term. At this time, she was accepted as a candidate for heart-lung transplant at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Without knowing what would come next, Anna began college and continued to push forward. Through four years of hard work and frequent doctor’s visits with her transplant team, Anna was able to graduate in 2017 with a nursing degree from Bethel University. Since finishing college last year, Anna’s health has continued to decline. After a full year spent developing a plan of care with her transplant team, Anna and her family have decided that her best chance for organs is at Stanford Medical center, in California. Now that Anna is listed at Stanford, it is unknown how long she will have to wait for the right match. In this time before surgery, Anna and her family are facing months of many overwhelming financial burdens, including rent and medical costs associated with care prior to transplant. After surgery, the financial pressure will only increase as they face the cost of hospital bills, many new medications, flights for family members so that relief support can be provided, and additional assistance for Anna so that she may lead an independent and productive life as she recovers in the year following transplant. ANY help during this time is incredibly appreciated. Unfortunately, transplant is not a cure-all for Anna’s condition. While she will no longer be living with PH, she will be a transplant patient for the rest of her life. This will bring forth a whole new set of risks and concerns. With that said, Anna’s new organs will allow her to live life in a new way. Her physical endurance will hopefully be greatly improved, so that Anna will be able to travel, hike, and exercise in ways that have never been an option to her in the past 19 years. Ultimately, Anna and her family are optimistic about the second chance at life that a heart-lung transplant could provide.Despite the chaos of this year, Anna’s faith in God throughout this process is unwavering, and she is fortified to know that He is walking with her always. If you are not able to contribute financially, please know that prayer is just as precious to Anna and her family in this season. Please lift her name up, and please share her story so that she can continue to be an outlet of light and hope for others. While Anna has been unable to begin pursuing a career as a nurse, she has instead chosen to push towards her calling as an artist and a writer. If you are looking for another way to support Anna, her artwork can be found for purchase on her website ( www.annalisabeth.co), or at GOLDEN RULE in Excelsior, MN.",197,1.6k,2,191,29 days,13 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Before her diagnosis in January 2017, she was busy helping her four sons - who range in ages from 14 to 6 pursue an Eagle Scout rank, navigate the wonders of boyhood and even prepare for kindergarten. She did all this while working as a full-time editor. Kendra has undergone radiation, chemotherapy and is now receiving an infusion treatment, along with antibiotics to work against her aggressive form of cancer. Her treatment was paused recently due to unexplained infections which brought on high fevers. The complications haven’t stopped with the physical. There are new financial concerns and worries about ongoing hospital stays to manage her everyday care and recovery. You would never guess this because Kendra’s smile continues to light up any room. This Texas native keeps her dry wit even on the darkest days. Kendra is as strong as she is funny. Her faith defines her. While in her early twenties, Kendra was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission when she met her future husband Travis.  After 15-plus years of marriage, Kendra and Travis have a steady partnership and continue to be everyone’s favorite couple to be around whether on the ballfield cheering on one of the boys or sitting in the audience of a school play. Kendra and Travis, who served in the US Air Force, have lived in Northern Virginia since 2000. Kendra inspires many of us - not only by how bravely and fiercely she’s fighting cancer for the second time, but also for the loving, accepting Christian she is in everyday life, for the fun and playful mom she is to four active and kind boys, for the devoted and caring daughter, sister, friend and wife she is. Care for Kendra has a goal of raising $50,000 to help with Kendra’s medical and related expenses. With questions swirling about Kendra’s infections, insurance coverage, and potential surgeries in her future, Kendra faces many unknowns. Please join us in caring for her by whatever means you feel led. You may offer financial support of any amount or give the gift of prayer or both. Whatever you do, please help spread the word on your Facebook page, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and any other venues at your fingertips. Thank you in advance.

Craig HospitalAttn: Rio Peterson Room #4033425 South Clarkson StreetEnglewood CO. 80113-----------------------------------------------------------------------Update Sunday, May 6th, 2018KREM 2 out of Spokane, Washington has shared Rio's story. That story can be found heree: https://www.krem.com/article/news/local/cda-nurse-runs-bloomsday-in-solidarity-for-friend-with-spinal-cord-injury/293-549375307Rio PetersonPlease Help Rio Continue His Care at Craig Hospital#RioStrong Riostrong.com

On April 16 th, Rio was skiing Squaw Mountain in Lake Tahoe where he suffered a spinal cord injury, fracturing C5 and C6 vertebrae’s in his neck. Rio was transported to Renown Medical Center in Reno and underwent spinal surgery followed by 9 days in the ICU. Through donations and many helping hands, Rio was medically transported to Craig Rehab Hospital in Denver, CO for intense rehabilitation. At this point Rio has movement in his right arm, limited in his left arm and is working on weaning off the ventilator. Because the injury is new, we’re praying for great strides to be made during his rehabilitation. Prior to Rio’s accident he was working as a travel nurse. Rio was not content performing required nursing duties and strived to raise the bar. Outside of work he often helped the less fortunate in the community. The stories of his kindness have been overwhelming. Although he would deny it, his kind heart has touched many people.We are now asking for your generosity to allow Rio continued care at Craig Hospital. During his rehabilitation, Craig will aggressively work with himphysically and psychologically. He does have insurance, but as most know, that only goes so far. Rio’s greatest chance at regaining physical function and generalhealth is to stay at Craig Hospital for one year. Rio’s insurance will cover only minimal physical and occupational therapy.

He tries with everything he has to get his body moving. Today they will do a swallow evaluation. We need his nasal tube out so he can be transported. That tube is feeding him now. We give him full body massage 2 x’s a day, pray around him and do a lot of energy work. He loves to read his email & text msgs. He’s on top of his care - he knows every med he’s given (the 5 rights- nursing language). He’s requested a lot of alternative treatments and herbs to reduce inflammation, promote stomach health and nerve pain - of course he gets turned down. No problem if he wants oxycodone or morphine, but god forbid if he wants B12. He cried and cried when he saw gofundme. He said “people are good”. The most amazing thing is that it will get him transported to Denver! Thank you, thank you! We’ll know more tomorrow when that will happen. Please, please keep praying for Rios lungs to start breathing on their own and we’ll set our goal higher after that one! #Riostrong. We love you all!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------Update #2 from Saturday, April 21st,I just got off the phone with Tawni, and my good friend Rio. How encouraging that was. Today hasn't been easy, but they're staying incredibly strong during the ""push through,"" and pushing through, they are. Rio has very much enjoyed the text messages that everyone has been sending him. He has his phone propped up in an area where he is able to read them. Please continue to send him your love and text messages. It helps to get him through.Rio's phone number is 208-899-9312. Please share it with his friends.---------------------------------------------------------Update from GoFundMe, Saturday April 21st.(Please see Tawni's latest update from Yesterday below this update)

This is amazing.  Rio's campaign has been noticed and is now under verification review by GoFundMe. This doesn't affect anything, they're just working on some details on the backend for verification purposes.

The verification review comes because of the tremendous love, support, and backing you have shown towards Rio.  There are many thousands of GoFundMe's that get created everyday, however they don't typically get this kind massive notice. GoFundMe has specifically recognized this.  Rio, and the Peterson Family have clearly made a massive impact on us all.

As part of the verification process GoFundMe has asked me to clarify a few things.

First, my name is Tony Agenbroad from Nampa, ID.  I still drive by the Peterson's old Nampa house everyday.  The house is looking great guys.I'm Radley's age, and grew up with the boys, and the Peterson family.  From elementary school, church, 4H pigs, ski trips, camping trips, college and beyond, I've been blessed to have been able to spend so much quality time with the Peterson Family.The funds from this campaign will be used to medically transfer Rio from Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV, to Craig Institute in Denver, CO.  Craig specializes in spinal chord trauma and rehabilitation.  It's where the magic happens.  Tawni has said that it is vital that we get him there. Denver is over 1,000 miles away from Reno. 

We will work with Hobie and Tawni, Rio's parents, as a part of securing the funds.  Words cannot thank everyone so much for your love and support.  Please stay strong. We know you will.Let's get Rio to Denver.

#RioStrong

-----------------------------------------------------Update from Tawni, Friday, April 20thHere we are on day 4. A bit of a roller coaster with more ups then downs. The High 5 foundation that supports injured athletes came in and met with Rio/us yesterday. It gave us the boost we needed. Rio’s intubation tube was removed and he was given a Trach for ventilation breathing. That’s given him tons of comfort plus we’re becoming good at lip reading. Tuesday he acquired ventilator pneumonia so he’s currently fighting that. A representative from Craig Rehab hospital is flying in Monday to meet with us. Because of the gofundme donations Rio has received, he’s got some money to be medically transported. It’s incredible to think this is becoming a reality. He could be transported as early as next week to their vent unit. Please pray that Rio comes off the vent and his lungs start working on their own. We’ll move on from there— baby steps! In the meantime, every person that comes to his room has to hug him, he thanks everyone and often will mouth, “you the man”. Continue to send the positive thoughts and prayers. We need them more now than ever.------------------------------------------------------------Update from Thursday, April 19th.Thank you SO very much to all of you, and the incredible amount of support EVERYONE has shown.  The Petersons can feel it, and it's positive energy like this that will make all the difference. Right now a priority is to get Rio to Craig Institute in Denver, CO. Craig Institute specializes in Spinal Chord injury.  It is the place Where the Magic Happens. It will not be easy to get Rio to Craig.Rio has some movement and sensation in his upper body.  He has some ability to move his arms, and we hope and pray that this will continue to improve. This is amazing progress so far.He is aware of the love of his family and friends that surround him, even from many miles away.  He is in good spirits, even sharing some ""brotherly love"" with Radley and Rabon, who have both made it down to Reno.Rio's accident happened on Monday, at Squaw Valley Ski Resort.  He was then transported to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV. Right now, Rio's mailing address is: Renown Medical Center, C/O Rio Peterson1155 Mill St. Reno, NV 89502 Rio PetersonSierra Intensive Care Unit Rm 110Throughout this week I (Tony), was approached by many different people talking about this campaign.  Everyone approached me saying the same thing. Everyone is saying ""It's crazy that the campaign is getting this kind of traction! With that though, I'm not surprised because Rio and The Peterson's are such great people."" I too am not surprised by the overwhelming support.  You all have been great.Please continue to share what you can and send your positive thoughts.  Let's get him to Denver, and let this Magic Happen.With much love, on behalf of The Peterson's -- thank you, everyone.-----------------------------------------------------------------Post from Monday, April 16thStarting a GoFundMe with some bad, yet hopeful news.

Our good friend Rio Peterson was in a skiing accident today, and has a spinal injury.  He fractured his C5-6 vertebrae, and what happens this  next week will be crucial to his healing.

The Peterson family is the most humble, and positive, family I know.  I've always felt their support, and I know there are a lot of us who can say the same.

We are raising funds for the Peterson family to be with Rio.  Please contribute what you can, and please always keep your thoughts positive.  Prayers for Rio",406,1.5k,0,422,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The newlyweds planned to enjoy their honeymoon in Spain a few days after their vows; however, their plans were interrupted due to an unexplainable and excruciating pain in Yelena’s left leg. Instead of a honeymoon, the couple visited the hospital several times with an unsuccessful diagnosis of her condition. Six days after her wedding, Yelena was unable to move her left leg, so Alfredo and Yelena’s mother drove her to the emergency room. Within hours of arriving at the emergency room, doctors discovered Necrotizing Fasciitis a flesh eating bacteria rapidly advancing through her leg.  An amputation was the only option to rid her body of the infection. This infection can be deadly, so immediate action had to be taken to save Yelena’s life. Newlyweds, Yelena and Alfredo, were not prepared for a tragedy like this. Yelena will need a prosthetic leg and intensive rehabilitative therapy, so she can live her life like she did before this tragedy. A marriage should not start with such a tragic experience and unexpected medical bills.  Yelena loves to dance, so we are hoping she can go straight to dancing soon after her recovery. Yelena is disciplined, dedicated, and determined. When she wants something, she goes after it. We know that with her loving husband, Alfredo, and all of us by her side, Yelena will come out of this situation stronger than ever before, and she WILL DANCE AGAIN!!!!!",230,709,15,241,4 months,29 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

The bills have begun rolling in and the family will be financially responsible for  long-term care within a week or so. (Fun fact: private helicopter rides are billed at $30,000!!!)  Any donations received will assist in the payment for treatment, any related costs incurred, and the upkeep of the Lichtenberger household.  Our family greatly appreciates any help you are able to give.  Keep praying for Carol, please, and we wish everyone peace and love.",193,290,0,198,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Needless to say, it has the possibility of affecting every organ in his body at any moment.  The care plan includes immediate and aggressive treatment with chemotherapy starting this Thursday, March 15th, 2018.  Art is presently battling high fevers and feeling very physically weak, not to mention emotionally and mentally drained about how his life has just been turned upside down.  He is overwhelmed beyond anything any of us can imagine after receiving such a devastating diagnosis.  If you know Art, you know him to be strong, funny, caring, and one of the most generous people you have ever met.  He is a doting dad to his twin daughters, Alyssa and Kalynn.  He is the eldest son of Auntie Rose and Uncle Art, protective older brother to Ryan and Lisa, and a great cousin and friend to so many people.  If you have ever heard of, or eaten at GrubShack in San Jose, you have most likely run into or spoken to him. To help Art during his time of need, we have set up this GoFundMe fundraising page and ask all those who know and care about Art to please pray hard for him, and if you are able, please donate any amount, big or small.  It will help greatly with enormous medical care and treatment costs not covered by insurance, living expenses, and various bills while Art's ability to work is indefinitely put on hold.We thank you all very much for taking the time to read about Art's situation.  Our ""Doctolero Ohana"" will continue to do our best to care for him, and with your help, it will certainly alleviate his mental anguish due to anticipated financial costs.   Your help and support will allow him to focus on getting through the chemo treatments, healing quickly, staying positive, and fighting his cancer to get back to a normal, healthy life.Thank you very much in advance.  We hope your generosity will come back to you tenfold!Warmest Regards,The Doctolero FamilyArt has authorized his aunt, Lita Doctolero-Tang, to manage the donation withdrawals from this fundraising campaign into a beneficiary bank account especially set up for Art.",245,1.2k,4,207,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Scoliosis is a disorder that causes an abnormal curve of the spine, or backbone and Ava’s curve was measured at 65 degrees. Because she is only 10 years old, there is great concern that the curve will continue to advance as she goes through puberty, resulting in alifelong disfigurement in her spine, discomfort and potential impacts on her lungs.Since being diagnosed, Ava has undergone a series of weekly                      non-surgical treatments, including a 2 week intensive care program in Orlando Florida over her Christmas Break. She has also been outfitted with a corrective brace that she currently wears 22 hours each day. Ava has traveled to the Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, as well as,several medical facilities in Georgia and Florida in search of the best treatment options going forward. To this point, health insurance hasnot covered any of Ava’s treatments and all expenses for treatment and travel have been paid out of pocket, creating a financial burden for the family.Looking ahead, Nemours Childrens Hospital in Jacksonville Florida offers a surgical procedure known a Vertebral Body Tethering that helps correct Scoliosis while still allowing for normal growth andflexibility of her spine. She has been scheduled for surgery May 9th.At this time the family is unsure how much their financial responsibilities will be for surgery and recovery but the current out of pocket costs for her treatments and pre-operative care are $25,000.Thank you in advance for your donations to help cover these costs and get Ava Grace on the road to recovery.Added by Jennifer to update for gofundme to be used correctly:

Medical,29,Penny and Orrin Freeman,https://www.gofundme.com/penny-and-orrin-freeman,"LOS ANGELES, CA","May 31, 2018","$20,000","$43,295","Family and friends, asking for help is incredibly difficult, but my mom and her husband, Penny and Orrin Freeman, are in need. Your contributions will go directly to ensuring that Orrin receives the care he needs to recover from a series of spinal infections that have caused him to lose the ability to walk, and for my Mom to be able to provide for his care while she undergoes chemotherapy for Stage 3 colon cancer. Mom and OrrinMom and Orrin met while they were both students at USC in the early 1970s. Orrin was a baseball player, and Mom was a musical theater actress in the theater program. While at USC, Orrin helped the team to 4 national championships, and is currently in the USC sports program hall of fame. Mom performed in numerous productions while at USC, including the West Coast premiere of The Who’s rock opera Tommy. After college, Orrin became a baseball coach. He coached at UC Santa Barbara, San Francisco State, and Sonoma State, before becoming a scout for the MLB. Orrin joined the Florida Marlins as a scout at the team’s inception in 1991 and has been with the team ever since. In his 27 years as a member of the Marlin’s franchise, he has helped the team win two world series titles and, in 2014, was awarded both Scout of the Year by Major League Baseball and received a lifetime achievement award from the Major League Baseball Scouting Association.After college, Mom graduated from law school and earned her Masters degree in Education and School Administration. She taught elementary school for 25 years in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and also became a Vice Principal and Principal at several schools before retiring in 2007. She continued to act and sing, performing with the Riverside Master Chorale, the Redlands Footlighters, the Riverside Community Theater, and many other productions.30 years after dating while at USC, Mom and Orrin reconnected, and were married in 2007.OrrinIn January of 2018, mom found Orrin incapacitated in his armchair. A lifelong diabetic, Orrin’s blood pressure had spiked and metastasized into a bacterial infection in his spine. He was hospitalized and intubated into a medical coma. Doctor’s found that he was too ill to receive an operation that would have given him a good chance of walking again, and in the meantime his insurance kept moving him from facility to facility. He can only be transported via medical transport (ambulance), and has been moved between the hospital, Skilled Nursing Facilities, and Assisted Living Facilities since January. His insurance also had him discharged from his Skilled Nursing Facility, determining that he was not making sufficient progress towards recovery due to “a possible problem with his brain”.Additionally, Orrin faces a difficult decision: he can undergo a full back reconstructive surgery due to the extensive damage done to his back by infection.  This is incredibly risky, but, if successful, would give him a much better change of walking again. If it fails, it would leave him in extensive pain without regaining the ability to walk. The other option is a spinal fusion procedure, which would potentially greatly reduce the amount of pain he is in, but would likely confine him to a wheelchair. Because of his condition, we are unsure whether or not Orrin will be able to return to work. Though he has been in Major League Baseball since 1982 and is entitled to a pension upon retirement, he must work until he is 70 to receive his full pension. He is currently 68 and a half, and may never work again, so while he is able to draw from his pension, he must do so at -48% what he would have received if he’d worked until the retirement age of 70. MomMy mom, Penny Freeman, has been Orrin’s caregiver and advocate since the day he entered the hospital. She’s there nearly every day, making arrangements, ensuring he’s attended to, and arranging his transportation to and from doctor’s appointments and various facilities via ambulance. In March 2018, that all changed.In March 2018, Mom was hospitalized in need of a blood transfusion. Though the transfusion initially helped, a couple weeks later she was hospitalized a second time. A diagnostic revealed that she had Stage 3 Colon Cancer, and though she had surgery to remove the cancerous growth in the colon, a biopsy revealed that the cancer had spread and she would need to undergo chemotherapy. She starts chemo on June 5th, and will have to be infused every two weeks until November. While her oncologist is confident that the chemotherapy will eradicate her cancer, the chemo itself will weaken her body and seriously lower her ability to fight off sickness and infection during the 5 months of treatment.While doctors had initially thought they had the infection under control, a recent test revealed that Orrin has a resurgence of infection in his spine. Because chemotherapy will drastically compromise her immune system, she is not allowed to be near Orrin until the infection is under control, meaning she cannot accompany him to doctor’s appointments.The NeedOrrin has exhausted his skilled nursing benefit through his insurance plan, so last month they had to pay $13,000 cash for him to be cared for. Because Mom is not allowed to be near Orrin while her immune system is compromised, he has been moved to an assisted living facility at a rate of nearly $6,000 a month. Because he is not able to ambulate or walk, or even sit up without intense pain, he has to be transported to and from doctor's appointments via ambulance, and since mom cannot accompany him, they must also pay someone to accompany him to and from doctor's appointments, all of this also out of pocket.

Medical,29,Help Teresa with brain cancer ,https://www.gofundme.com/help-7-year-old-teresa-beat-cancer,"SELLERSVILLE, PA","March 5, 2018","$50,000","$43,124","Teresa Sensinger of Perkasie, PA, daughter of Andrew and Michelle Sensinger is battling brain cancer. The family is requesting donations to help with mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses. Please read Teresa’s story below:Early in May of 2017, Teresa Sensinger was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She underwent surgery but due to the tumor’s location, total removal was not possible. From there, Teresa underwent vigorous physical therapy along with high dose chemo and radiation therapies. Her surgery had left her with some physical deficits, but her positive spirit was unwavering. By August, Teresa was able to come home from the hospital just in time to celebrate her seventh birthday with family and friends. Through the summer and fall, her doctors continued with the most aggressive treatment options possible to prevent the reoccurrence and spread of the cancer cells. Unfortunately, by fall of 2017, the doctors found that the tumors had returned. Through the help of the “Make-A- Wish Foundation”, Teresa was able to walk the beautiful beaches of Florida, visit Sea World, Disney, the Kennedy Space Center, and visit with family in Georgia.After returning home from her trip, Teresa continued with her chemo treatments. In January, a follow up scan revealed several new tumors extending down her spine. Her doctors determined that as aggressive as the chemo was, it just wasn’t working. The medical team decided to discontinue the chemo, and began a palliative course of radiation. Teresa completed this last course of treatment on February 20th, but was readmitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) just two days later with nausea and uncontrollable headaches. Her doctors have worked tirelessly searching for treatment options to give her relief. At that time, Teresa was experiencing severe balance deficits and had lost most of her hearing, and later her ability to speak, but the hope was that these were side effects of the radiation and would subside with time.This past Friday, Teresa’s parents, Andrew and Michelle, sat down with their team of doctors and received the worst news any parent could imagine. The latest scan showed the tumor had now wrapped around Teresa’s brain stem and there was nothing more they could do. This coming Tuesday, the hospital will be transporting her back home under hospice care, where she can be surrounded by her family and loved ones. Due to mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses not all covered by insurance, the family is requesting donations to alleviate the financial burden on Andrew and Michelle. Remember, every little bit helps and no contribution is too small as we read in Mark 12: 41-44.The family also requests your prayers during this difficult time. All donations will be given to the Sensinger family, Michelle and Andrew.￼￼￼￼￼￼",652,3.0k,17,673,6 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have Secondary Progressive MS, which is an aggressive form of the disease where I am able to enjoy some periods of relief and partial recoveries. Five years ago my friends got together to raise money for an alternative oxygenation treatment in Guayaquil.  I  was blown away by the love and support that I received from friends all across the globe that in many cases I hadn’t spoken to in years.  It was so uplifting and a huge motivation for me and I am forever grateful.  I will never be able to express how truly therapeutic the support and love was for me in that very dark time of my life.The oxygenation treatment was initially a success. I experienced an incredible improvement in mobility of my limbs, especially in my left side which is the side most affected by the disease.   A short time after the treatment was complete, however, I suffered a very strong relapse.  The journey since has been a difficult one.  I have alternated between alternative and traditional medicine and treatments. Although I have experienced some improvements from time to time, generally they were always followed by strong relapses and eventually I have ended up primarily in a wheel chair with very little mobility in my legs.  This past September it became increasingly difficult to do things on my own, it got to a point where I needed help doing everything including going to the bathroom.  I’ve learned how horrible it is to have to depend completely on people to help me even in the simplest of tasks.  At the beginning of this year I started seeing a Bio Energetic doctor.  Through his treatments, which include neural therapy, homeopathy, acupuncture, magnetic therapy as well as brain training we have managed to not only stabilize my regression but I have also regained a lot of energy and mobility to the point where I am once again able to restore some of my independence and do things on my own.  For the first time in a long time I have hope again.  I believe God has given me a second chance of life.I would like to continue the treatments with my current doctor which are helping me so much.  Unfortunately the situation in Ecuador is very difficult and health insurance doesn’t cover alternative treatments .  So I am here humbly asking for your support again.   Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated and if you cannot help, please don’t feel bad.  I appreciate your love and support just as much.  I am hoping as I get better that I will be able to make it to Miami and even NY and hope to see you all soon. With love,Reg",114,269,2,115,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Thank you. It means so much.Others have asked if they can still assist. Because things happened so quickly they didn't have time to respond. All I can say is we are walking a road we've never traveled and costs may exceed what we might have imagined. This surgery will cost over a million dollars.  We are thankful for insurance, however he will need to meet deductables, co-pays, etc, not covered by insurance. My father's post surgery meds may range from 5-9k a month (insurance covers up to 70%).  Whatever he receives in donations will be helping out immensely.______________David, has had a persistent cough. In the fall of 2016 it worsened noticeably. Justifiably concerned, he took his concern to a litany of doctors to ascertain the issue. The search came to an end in late November with a difficult diagnosis. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis was the cause. This condition is terminable. The only hope for survival, with any quality of life was to qualify for and undergo surgery for a lung transplant. Our family was, and is, stunned.With this devastating news,  we began to research in order to determine the best place to receive the transplant. The answer was the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. David began the work of getting on the list. Without going into detail suffice it to say this is an arduous task. The encouraging news is that he has now finally been put on the transplant list for both the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pittsburg Hospital.And that is what leads to my request for your help.You see our family lives in Coral Springs, Florida and while insurance pays for much of the medical costs many of our needs are formidable and out of pocket. We will need to establish a temporary residence near these cities. We hope to be able to travel from our full-time home to spend time as caregivers for our dad. Someone must be with him 24 hours a day. He is now on oxygen around the clock. Medication costs that are not covered by insurance are beginning to add up. Even after the procedure is completed it is required to stay close to the hospital in case of complications. He will be enrolled in a pulmonary rehab for two months following the surgery. This cost, too, is not covered by any insurance. We will live near the hospital part time and commute to our home part time. Obviously, this has altered our existence and placed extensive hardship on our family. But with grace we will survive. Together,  we will have it covered, will get it done, and pour our best into this as one family team.Would you be willing to help us through this medical crisis by providing a financial contribution to assist us with lodging and transportation during this season? When all is said and done we estimate it will cost somewhere around $26,000 to meet these expenses. It seems formidable, but we hold onto hope for the future.  Any gift would be greatly appreciated. Join our team. With many on the team, we are confident we can pull through. Thank you so much for your consideration. We will keep you posted about the progress as we move forward.This page was created by Ericka Underwood, the eldest daughter of David Underwood. Donations will cover:1.

He was having a lovely day with family at the beach in Florida, playing with his nephew in the water, when he was rolled by an unexpectedly large wave. He must have hit his head extremely hard and lost consciousness, we are not sure for how long. His nephew pulled him from the water and his father gave him CPR to pump seawater and sand from his lungs. He has been unable to breathe unassisted since then and we’re uncertain if he gained consciousness although it’s possible he did open his eyes at some point before going to the ER. He was rushed to the ER as a near-drowning victim where they discovered he had several fractured vertebrae. He is currently in a medically induced coma and has been in surgery for 8 hours. Information we have:His C1 and C7 vertebrae are fractured, C4 broke into the spinal cord, C2 is shattered, there may be skull fractures, and the spinal cord is severed. The surgery (expected to be over 8 hours long) is intended to prevent further damage and Don will be kept in a medically induced coma for an undetermined amount of time to try to promote as much healing as possible. Doctors are not yet sure of brain activity or possible damage, partly because they do not know how long he was unconscious underwater. They think maybe as long as 4 minutes. The prognosis is that the spinal cord cannot be mended so the best-case scenario has Don being a quadriplegic which would be irreversible. The next challenge for him to overcome will be to see if he can breathe on his own, which is unknown at this time. It could be as long as several weeks while Don is in a coma before anyone knows whether or not he can breathe without a ventilator.As you can imagine this is a devastating time for both Donald and Kelly, she’s a warrior for sure but the scenario is taxing all of her resources emotionally and financially. She has just left for Florida to be with Don and his family.

For those of you who know both Krist and Tasha, know that this time has been very challenging for them. They need our help. Krist was diagnosed in  April 2017 with a rare type of cancer; Ampula Of Vater. A tumor growing on his ampula blocked the common bile duct. Krist went in for a Whipple Procedure 3 weeks after his diagnosis to remove the tumor and then started a very difficult chemotherapy treatment from June 2017 through September. In September, Krist got very sick from a blood infection so the doctors decided to stop the chemotherapy as they knew it would be too hard on his body during that time. While Krist had been battling this blood infection, Tasha went in for an MRI that month upon finding a lump in her breast. Tasha was diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. The doctors opted for a double mastectomy, 8 chemo treatments and 28 radiation treatments. Just 5 months later, in Feb 2018, it was found that Krist’s cancer had metastasized to his liver. He went through more chemotherapy that went through the end of June 2018. The doctors said at that point that they have exhausted chemotherapy options at the facility. They suggested that he be a part of a trial at the University of Chicago of Medicine. During that same week they went to the Block Center for another opinion for treatment for both hormone replacement therapy for Tasha and other medical options for Krist. The day after the appointment at the Block Center, Krist ended up in the hospital with jaundice. He needs to get his bilirubin numbers down and figure out what the next steps are. 

Over the last year combined, Tasha and Krist have been indebted with medical bills. Please help this beautiful family. There is no amount too small. Every little bit will help take the financial stress off their plates while they continue to get treatment. Please keep this beautiful family in your prayers.

I Iove life and am determined to continue my journey in making a positive impact in people’s lives.With love, BalushkaFor ukrainian cards (для украинских карточек ) вы можете перевести на Карта Привата 5168 7555 3055 9539 Татьяна БалушкаШиро дякую!",324,1.6k,20,316,1 month,18 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
