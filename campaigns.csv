He's always been ready with a helping hand, whether it was introducing us to the wild world of Amazon, teaching us something new, or just being a great friend when we needed it. It's hard to think of someone who is more willing to jump in and be there to do the right thing.It’s our turn to help Ryan and his family however we can. As some of you may already know, Ryan had to have surgery to remove an infection that was next to his spine. Unfortunately the surgery ended with complications and Ryan came out of surgery paralyzed from the chest down. He will be in a rehab hospital for several months. The Leslie family home will need to be remodeled to accommodate a wheelchair and they will also need to purchase a different vehicle. It’s unknown what insurance will cover and what type of long term care will be needed.Any donation will go directly to Ryan and his family to help cover medical and home care expenses.",326,869,3,328,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

As a result Bill was paralyzed from the neck down and has lived the last 48 years of his life as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. Bill took on his disability the same way he played sports, with courage and determination, and has lived these years independently, graduating from, working for, and retiring from UC Berkeley, initially as an early medical retirement, and now, full retirement.However, upon his full retirement in June Bill lost a major source of income, UC sponsored Long Term Disability payments at $900.00 per month. Bill used these funds to help pay for his daily attendant care needs required for a quadriplegic to live independently. The loss of these funds threatens Bill’s ability to live independently in his home. In addition, concurrently with this loss of income, both his needs for, and the cost of, attendant care are rising. Bill anticipated this loss of income a year before it happened and diligently cut back on his expenses at home and researched other ways to replace the income in order to pay for attendant care, through social services and public benefits, but to no avail, as the options were either disqualifying or share of cost prohibitive.As well, recent serious illness, surgery, and hospitalizations have left Bill recovering in bed since January, and the need for attendant care increasing even further than anticipated and his newly reduced income will now barely cover the cost of basic attendant care, if that. In addition to Bill’s normal daily routine of an attendant getting him out of and into his bed into and out of his wheelchair daily, and helping with his morning and evening hygiene and medication regimes, attendant care is needed when he is bedbound to bring him meals, turn him in his bed to prevent pressure sores, help with the same daily hygienic and medication regimes but now including assistance with respiratory therapies and wound care.Bill’s need for financial assistance is immediate and will be ongoing for attendant care and possibly other needs such as adaptive equipment for everyday living that could help mitigate some of the attendant care needs by keeping Bill healthier, back in his wheelchair, able to do more for himself without help, and out of the hospital.Throughout Bill’s life he always thought of others before himself in his school, family, and work lives, whether through his kindness, his volunteer work, or his patient listening to our stories and complaints, and now it is our turn to think of and support Bill.",230,189,2,293,1 month,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are reaching out to our friends, family, well-wishers and looking at crowd funding options to raise money to help with the treatment costsHow it beganIt all started in 2009, when training for a half a marathon, Smitha noticed a sudden onset of fatigue. She went from running 5mi comfortably to needing breaks every half a mile.She also noticed that her flip flops would keep coming off her feet while she was walking.Within a week, she felt an odd tingling sensation in her fingers that spread to her arms.  Followed by cold wet droplets on her face and neck.As these symptoms worsened, she knew something was seriously wrongIn Sept2009, at age of 24, Smitha was diagnosed with MSWhat is MS?MS is an auto-immune disease that affects the central nervous system.Our nerves have a protective sheathing called Myelin. This ensures that electrical impulses can travel through the length of the nervous system. In MS, the patient’s immune system marks this myelin as a threat and starts to attack them. As the myelin gets depleted, the brain can no longer communicate with the rest of the body effectively.The loss of Myelin shows up as black / white scar marks in MRI. MS attacks in waves. And, each attack results in further myelin loss. This directly translates to increased physical disability in the patient.When Smitha was diagnosed with MS, she was still a student. Her Student Health insurance did not cover the treatment costs. She could not afford to pay for her medication, out of pocket.In just 4 months after her diagnosis, hit by a giant relapse. The severity of attack alarming and it affected her quality of life permanently After coming to terms with these new physical limitations, we decided to make the best of what life had to offer. We traveled when we could, added a dog to our family, fostered a few dogs, charted our future, and eventually started thinking about starting our own family. In Jan2016, we were blessed with not just one, but a set of Twin boys!In the 9 years since her diagnosis, Smitha’s condition has constantly been worsening due to multiple relapses. Each relapse has required her to change to the next strongest FDA approved meds in market and none of them have been effective. After another attack in May 2018, we found out that our options for more drugs were quickly running out.We are now at to a point where we need to make some hard choices. If left untreated, the next MS attack could happen any moment. And that can lead to vision loss, memory issues, complete loss of bladder control and even needing a wheelchair permanently.Our kids are only 2.5 years old. And, in these 2.5 years, Smitha has been forced to watch the kids growfrom the sidelines.She was NOT there when the kids took their first steps.She was NOT there when the boys entered the swimming pool for the first time.She has NOT been able to walk with them to the neighborhood parkAnd, she knows, she won’t be able to help them ride a bike,or , play ball with them in the evenings,Or, come running to their aid, when they need her help.After her recent relapse, she has been feeling so exhausted, that she cannot even pick up her kids or even talk coherently when tired.All of this can change though. And the answer is in an extremely promising clinical trial called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, or HSCT.HSCT is the first and only medical procedure that can not only stop MS, but also reverse the symptoms of MS, by re-growing the lost myelin. The idea here is to wipe out the faulty immune system in the body with Chemotherapy, then reintroduce the patient’s stem cells and build a new immune system from scratch. This hard reboot of the immune system is a rigorous procedure that takes about a month and a half to complete. It is a risky procedure and is only administered to patients that have an aggressive case of MS and who have not responded well to other FDA approved medications. Among such patients, the results from past trials have been very promising. In upto 87% of the cases, this reprogrammed immune system does not attack the myelin again and thereby stops further progression of the disease. It has also shown to significantly reduce the patient’s disability and patients show continued recovery even after 4 years post treatment.But, the best of the insurance programs do not cover this procedure, as it is not FDA approved yet, which has put the entire burden of raising the money for this procedure on us.The last time the insurance did not cover her treatment MS dealt a swift and devastating blow. We are fully committed to defeating MS this time around.And with your help, we will be a step closer to achieving that goal.We don’t have much to offer you other than our gratitude. All we can say, is thanks for supporting us in our fight. There are a few ways in which you can choose to donate and help us out. You can read about this in the More Info section.You can also help by sharing this link on social media. Tag your friends you think might help. Also share this with friends and family who might be suffering from diseases like Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, progressive scleroderma or other forms of autoimmune disease. The same treatment mentioned above can help turn around their lives too.If we do manage to go beyond our goals, we will donate all the excess money to the next patient who is eligible for this trial and for whom the insurance does not cover this life changing procedure.",600,1.2k,0,584,10 days,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,11,Help Patrick Fight Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/hud44-help-patrick-fight-cancer,"PHILADELPHIA, PA","March 29, 2018","$75,000","$67,895","Hello, my name is Crystal Nardone, and my husband, Patrick Connors, is a painter, art scholar, and an art teacher. He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate. Thank you.",565,1.6k,14,565,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are the fortunate friends of Jane Schiowitz and we are ready to move mountains for our fierce pal as she fights brain cancer, but we need your help.Jane is a mom, a wife, a daughter, and a sister, but to us she is our creative, fun-loving, loyal friend whose infectious laugh fills any room. (Jane & her husband Rick Brooks)She is a gifted artist by trade and an amazing Mom to her teenage son.(Jane & her son Julian)
In early March 2018, Jane started having strange symptoms: facial spasms, numbness, and weakness on her left side.  An MRI revealed a tumor on the right side of her brain.  Living close to New York City, Jane was able to get exceptional medical care. Surgery on March 14 resulted in the removal of 95 percent of the tumor. While her surgery was successful, the type of cancer she has — glioblastoma — is aggressive and may come back. Within the next month, Jane will undergo intensive treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy and a clinical trial at Sloane-Kettering. This next phase of treatment is arduous and costly.



After digesting this news, we decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf. Jane has not been able to work since her diagnosis and will not be able to work throughout the course of her treatment, which will also create a significant financial hardship for her family. She will and has already incurred significant expenses due to her recent neurosurgery, hospital stay and rehabilitation. These medical expenses are adding up quickly and will be prohibitive.Jane’s wonderful spirit has touched so many people. We hope that we 


can raise $75,000 to help defray her medical costs and ease her family’s financial burden which will allow her to focus on beating cancer.You can keep up with her latest progress and share your well wishes on her Facebook page.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking an interest in this very dear cause.   (Jane and her sister Nan)

The pregnancy was going well until complications started to emerge. Then the beginnings of a heart-breaking nightmare began to unfold. Little Aaron was born prematurely on Wednesday, August 1st and was delivered by emergency C-section. His health took a sharp downturn when he suddenly stopped breathing. Aaron was taken to the ICU where it was discovered he had an infection. Worse, Claire also came down with an infection that required immediate surgery. It was so aggressive, that Claire had four separate surgeries to remove all of it (it had invaded a large amount of tissue including several organs). The doctors worked frantically to eradicate the infection, but sadly, didn't expect her to live.  By a miracle, Claire has beat the odds, but she is still in critical condition. As with any medical treatment, the cost (so far) of treating her and her newborn son has been astronomical. Zack has been with his wife the entire time so their income has stopped. The continued treatment and recovery will take months and will certainly be financially devastating. It is hard to determine how much all the bills will add up to, but Zack and Claire are in urgent need of financial assistance to help them cover all the costs and stay on their feet. In the meantime, prayers are requested and much appreciated.

Medical,12,Detective Atkinson Needs Assistance,https://www.gofundme.com/detective-atkinson-needs-assistance,"WEST ISLIP, NY","April 29, 2018","$50,000","$63,978","Detective Jamie Atkinson is a highly decorated, 36 year old officer who has been employed with the New York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department for the past 15 years.  On his days off, he serves on the Board of Directors for his local volunteer EMS organization and works as a Safety Officer at Northwell Health.  Jamie has always answered calls for assistance with a selfless enthusiasm, whether it was responding to ground zero as a volunteer EMT after the September 11th Terrorist Attack to provide countless hours of search and recovery operations, responding to and investigating crime scenes or organizing a local charity event.  However on Tuesday, November 21, 2017 Detective Jamie Atkinson answered the call that would change his life forever.  When he answered the phone, Jamie immediately knew that this call was different than the thousands of calls that he had answered in the past.  This call was from his doctor who, after advising Jamie to acquire a CT scan of his abdomen after examining him for chronic pain and swelling, called to inform him that he needed to immediately respond to a specialist for further testing.  The CT scan the doctor explained, had revealed what appeared to be multiple masses in his abdomen.  Further testing would later reveal the diagnoses of a rare condition known as Pseudomyxoma Peritonei (PMP).  PMP occurs when a cancerous tumor in the appendix creates a high grade cancerous Mucin (cells that create a cancerous mucus) that eventually ruptures through the appendix wall causing the Mucin to fill the abdominal cavity, where it continually produces cancerous mucus.  This cancerous mucus then spreads to other organs where it creates new tumors.  It is estimated that this condition occurs in only 1 per 1,000,000 persons a year.  Doctors believe that Jamie’s exposure to the many airborne carcinogens during his countless hours volunteering at ground zero in the aftermath of the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks has contributed to this cancer.At this time, Jamie is currently undergoing bi-weekly chemotherapy treatments in order to shrink the cancerous tumors in his abdomen prior to his upcoming scheduled surgery.  This invasive surgery, which could take up to 15 hours to complete, consists of the removal of several organs and the placement of “heated” chemotherapy directly into the abdomen during surgery in an attempt to destroy any remaining microscopic cancer cells.  The recovery from this surgery, which is referred to as the mother of all surgeries, could leave Jamie in the Intensive Care Unit for upwards of a month.  The surgery and recovery process will not only cause an incredible emotional burden on Jamie’s family, but it will also cause a steep financial burden on them as well.  Not only will the family have to take off numerous days from work to support Jamie throughout the surgery and month long recovery process, but the family will also have to travel or stay overnight near the hospital, which is located in New York City.Jamie has always answered the call for anyone who was in need of assistance.  Now it is our time to answer his call and to provide the family with as much support as possible.  Please know that this fund is being handled by fellow MTA Police Lieutenant Chris Nutter, who has worked with Jamie for the past 15 years.  Lt. Nutter in no way intends to benefit financially from this fund and 100% of the donations raised will go directly to the Atkinson Family to assist with any financial expenses incurred during the surgery and recovery process.  Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.",619,1.7k,8,624,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Jen was in the 31st week of her first pregnancy and thought of nothing but the baby’s health. Within two days, doctors located two embolisms-one in Jen’s heart and one in her lung, as well as a “mass” in her heart. The “mass” turned out to be angio-sarcoma, a very rare form of cancer.On Friday, April, 6, 2018, Jen underwent her first chemotherapy treatment. She will continue to have weekly treatments of chemotherapy until doctors are able to deliver her baby at 37 weeks. Her treatments will resume two weeks after the baby is born. There are simply no words that can adequately describe the fear and the heartache Jen and her husband Matt have endured these past two weeks.Jen and Matt were made for each other. They met while volunteering for Youth Group, a program designed to provide academic opportunities for children in need. Through their shared love of history (they are both teachers), travel, education, and volunteerism, they fell in love and married in 2008. I met Jen when she started teaching at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Currently, Jen teaches Advanced Placement U. S. History and Psychology, a demanding schedule for any veteran teacher, but Jen’s dedication and hard work quickly made her one of the most respected members of the faculty.Jen is the type of teacher who spends countless hours before and after school helping students, some of whom are not even in her classes, with their schoolwork. She is constantly organizing fieldtrips, advising clubs, and volunteering her time to those in need. Every year Jen lets her hair grow, only to cut and donate it to The Jimmy Fund’s program that provides wigs for cancer patients. Just last year, Jen was voted the “Most Inspirational Teacher” and was also awarded “Teacher of the Year.” As a person, Jen is the most selfless person I know. She’s never too busy to sit down with a colleague. Take today for instance, while in intensive care Jen sent out a group text to our department reminding us of a colleague’s birthday, even apologizing for not being able to make his favorite dessert. There has never been a birthday or special occasion Jen has not remembered and celebrated.When Jen and Matt found out they were expecting a baby, it was a dream come true for them. Their excitement was infectious, both had dreamt of being parents. But since March 31th, their life will never be the same. Jen and Matt are both teachers and the medical bills are starting to pile up. Matt works in Providence, RI and has been making the daily trip from Providence to Boston to be with his best friend. Unfortunately, there is a long road ahead.With all the anxiety and fear they are experiencing, the financial burden is one that we are hoping to alleviate. Please consider donating to help Jen and Matt on their long journey but most of all, please pray for them. Thank you and please share this message, as I know Jen would be doing everything in her power to help anyone else in this situation.Sincerely,Mindy Morin",954,1.7k,12,956,4 months,19 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

As you know my favorite things to share are my kids and people helping people. My goal in to show you how awesome my family is or to make you smile. There is so much negativity in the world i like to share the good things. I don’t share much personal stuff on here so this next post is going to be quite hard for me. There is a part of my story that I have kept silent for some time now. Every time I open up about it I seem to gain a new understanding or some knowledge that may help me. I am not ashamed, I was just hoping to tell this story from the other side but it’s taking a little longer than I hoped. If you’ve been wondering why i haven’t been around or as involved as much as usual, here’s why! So….Feb. 23rd 2017, I got a phone call telling me that I had metastatic melanoma. Yes, a phone call! I had a swollen lymph node on my right side, went to a surgeon and had it removed. Feb. 23rd they called and told me what it was. If you want to hear about how horribly they delivered the news I can tell you in person. But, lets not dwell on the lame parts of this story!. So, here’s the deal. I got some scans immediately and nothing else showed up. I was elated!!! The doctors at SCCA at Evergreen put me on immunotherapy as a “insurance” plan. It’s called adjuvent therapy. Well, this therapy made me super sick last summer. I was sick from the 5th of July until about the 15th. (103 degree temp etc…). They took me off this therapy and gave me a high dose of prednisone. That is the worst good drug out there. If you’ve ever had it, you know what i am talking about. It makes you feel like you drank 16 cups of coffee and you are severely agitated. (sorry Jessie)Sept. 2017 we did a scan and found 6 new locations of potential disease. Two of which are on my liver (no bueno). I started a new immunotherapy called pembrolizimab (same as Keytruda ads on TV) and this had a mixed response but was not working as well as we hoped so, they placed me on a “clinical trial”. I tried that for a while, it sucked; bad side effects and had to get shots in my stomach daily for a while. The side effects have been rough. I had some serious migraines (which I never suffered from before), hearing loss, ringing in my ears, cluster headaches with stroke like symptoms etc… (Thank you Mercer Island Fire Dept., I hoped I would never have to call you but you were great). Needless to say some of the side effects have sucked! Good news, almost all of them have reversed!!! Yeah! I did some scans after being in the trial for a while and they found that I had 26% tumor progression. They allow up to 20% but 26% was too high so they took me off of the trial. The good news is my tumors were really small so 26% progression means they are still small. This brings us to now. I recently got in touch with some friends who encouraged me to go to CA to get some opinions. I have seen doctors at UCLA and MD Anderson in Texas. I have been to Texas two times in the last two weeks and have had a couple of tumors removed in the event we try T-cell therapy in the future. Right now I am eagerly awaiting to find out what my next treatment plan will be. I had surgery last week and am still recovering. It has been very painful but getting better slowly. The good news is that although my diagnosis is ""stage 4 metastatic melanoma"" there are a number of different treatment options still available to me. (the stages are based off of the last 10 years of survival rates. The medications today were not even available 2 years ago) I am an optimist to a fault as you all know. This has been a hard battle and will continue to be hard but I WILL WIN! I repeat, I WILL WIN!. I would love any and all support you can spare. I am a helper and i am terrible at asking for help when i need it. I want to give a big shout out to my wife Jessie and my Family. There is no way i could do this without them. Jessie has taken care of all the paperwork (there is TONS) so i can just focus on being healthy and not thinking about it until i need to. Jessie is a rockstar and i am thankful for her daily. My parents and in laws have helped us with airfare and hotel stays while traveling to all these appointments. I didn't think having an illness could require so much travel and travel is expensive, especially when it's last minute. Not worrying about the financial burden of these trips has been amazing. Thank you to everyone that already knows and has been helping silently. There are many of you that have provided prayer, hugs, dinners etc. This is the first time in my life i have been dealt something i can't ""handle"" on my own. I have learned a lot over this past year and continue to learn daily. first and foremost i have learned i need to lean on other people when i need them. Don’t be offended if I didn’t tell you about this. I shared this with few people hoping it would be a quick battle and i could tell my story when it was over. What can you do/How can you help:-I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP, IM TERRIBLE AT ASKING FOR HELP!-DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF MY KIDS!(they know but let me handle any discussions about it)-DON’T TREAT ME LIKE IM SICK(if you do, i may punch you in the throat and ask how you are This is a part of my story now, what it means to be Kirk Robinson, K-Rob, Kirky, Nino, hollywood, surfer boy or whatever you may call me. I wouldn't have picked this part of the story line, that's for sure. No sense being upset at the cards your dealt, just play them the best you can! I have met several people along this journey that i wouldn't have met otherwise. I am thankful for their support and their encouragement to share my story! Jim Brown, Ann Jarris Adam Throop, Melinda McKinley-throop, Rob Sweet and my ""text prayer group"". One group of people Monster and Sea heard my story through a friend and i found a card in my mailbox with some money to help us out. Timing could not have been better! I was so choked up that a group of people would want to help like this. It meant more than you can imagine!Please keep me and my family in your prayers! I know God has control over this. I pray daily that my eyes are open to the things around me and that i will be healed. I am a Blessed man, I am so lucky to have the family and friends that i do. I am thankful daily!HERES TO KICKING CANCERS ASS!!!!!

Medical,12,Help for special needs kid/moving,https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid,"MACON, GA","May 25, 2018","$75,000","$63,210","https://youtu.be/_Owd9bx-RCUHello, thank you for taking time to read my campaign for our son, David. Like any family, when our son hurts, we hurt. When my husband wakes up our son for school in the mornings it tears my soul apart when he tells me when I get home from work that David has vomited in his sleep because he had a seizure. The thought that he could have died right there in his bed is the worst possible nightmare that We could ever have and the fear of it becoming reality set us in motion to save our son. A kind service dog has eased, but not erased the worry and dread by standing guard of him and being able to detect and alert to the oncoming seizures so  that my husband can now half way sleep knowing that he will hear her cries for help when David’s voice is gone.The Doctors tried him on many medications (some all at once) to try and stop the seizures as he was having them daily. These medications almost cost him his life just because of their chemical nature. We trusted these Doctors that their medical expertise with these medications were in David’s best interest, past my own knowledge, my husband researched them and wow the side effects, and then watched these dangerous chemicals that are prescribed in good faith have a different chemical reaction in our son that could not have been foreseen, the seizures got worse, our son has fought many times for his life with Doctors fighting to bring him back and keep him here. David has a service dog, seizures, seizure medications, and Doctors. What he doesn’t have is the ability to be a child because the seizures have stolen his childhood from him. He cannot even ride his bike to the park with friends. What would happen if he had a seizure crossing the street? He cannot go to school and enjoy when he is so tired and recovering from days of seizures to the point he was going to have to be isolated even more and taught at home. David cannot just go be a kid with his friends because “What if this is THE seizure that We have been tearing our hearts and brains  apart to stop, and prayerfully begging that never comes. Neither of us can protect him in his own bed, let alone away from home. His dog helps detect and alert, but she would not be able to render the medical care that he would need. We would have to just trust that some stranger would recognize it, and call for help. Also hope that someone driving the street where he fell did not look down at the radio, or to another distraction for a split second and hit David or Malory. Can any father or mother  in good faith trust their child’s life to the hands of potential strangers? If a parent did, would they have their child’s best interest? Are we really doing the right thing by imprisoning him for any reason and watching his childhood pass him by? How do We keep from hating ourselves because we are supposed to be able to fix this and protect him? What can We do? Nobody can save our son, and neither of us are willing to accept letting him go, or his innocence of catching lightening bugs and bringing me a wilted flower that he had in his pocket for an hour or the dead bug to his dad that he accidentally sat on die in our faces. His eyes search us for help, and we have none.In February 2018, after my husband did some researching and wrestling with the idea, asking myself about the law, the thought of giving something illegal to our child that was for our entire childhood “a bad and dangerous drug,” we started treating him with Marijuana. Unfortunately it is still illegal here in Georgia. We had plans and hopes of getting him on a good track with school, and referred out of state to better and broader medical practices. We both demanded to know what is going into our child, and while we did everything we could to know, neither of us had any legal access to a Doctor’s experience with different kinds. We knew the risks that we read, the medical research that We both had to pour over for hours fighting what is right/legal/safe/moral, I informed all of his medical team because we wanted our son to be safe. I was not advised to stop treating him this way along with safer medications from the Doctor. The Doctor did not comment exactly why, but I think she wanted to see for herself. The combination granted our son 71 days seizure FREE!!!!! For 71 days our son rode his bike, woke up, went to school, played with friends, played outside, and the terror for his life that gripped our hearts and souls began to lift. The smiles on our faces reflecting our child getting to be a normal child. Safe in his bed. Doing better in school. Having a great quality of life. We were breaking the law. We saved our son. We were fixing the fragments the best way we could of him being that little boy that was taken away from him by these seizures. This is our job as parents, to protect our child even with our own lives. As I wrote above, I kept his medical team up to date. As we felt we had found his miracle, and anyone else who saw his medical history would see this too. We also felt like his entire medical team truly cared for him and wanted the same things we did, and with honesty on my part and his safety forefront of every visit, we were winning. This transparency also meant informing a new therapist who did not share our joys or beliefs that allowing him access to marijuana was worth this new life he had begun. I was reported to DCFS, and on April 19, 2018 their representatives along with deputy sheriff’s entered our home with our cooperation and full truth of what and why, and despite the evidence, demanded that I stop “abusing” our son by giving him this “dangerous” marijuana. Allowing him to have debilitating seizures that threaten his life and any quality of that life was quite okay as long as he was not using marijuana. They did not even apply his medical team’s observations and findings to their opinions. If you are unsure what is worse, look up seizure medication side effects. Then look up medical research for marijuana usage as seizure treatment. Compare the two with success rates, side effects, birth defects that are known, long term effects that are known, what class of drug they are in by abuscability, pretend David is your child, and tell us honestly that following the law, but risking his life is better than trying something that is illegal, but with mountains of medical data as to it’s worth as a treatment to the point on becoming legal in certain states. We stood behind our decision to save our son’s life even though we had not made the move yet, and openly admitted to allowing him to use it for the treatment of his seizures. We have never lied about where he got it, or our intentions. The DCFS demanded that we cease this immediately. Against our better judgement, we did. They were not there for the times my husband had to drag our son to the truck because it takes 45 minutes for help to arrive. They were not there for the times that we carried him out of the house to break the traffic laws to get him the help he so desperately needed. They were not there to see my husband loose several jobs because we were rushing our son to get medical help. They were not there when we spent almost 3 months in an emergency room everyday because our son was being transported because he’d done had another seizure either at home or at school, or that 2 weeks out of those 3 months was spent at a hospital in Atlanta begging the doctors to take him off the medication that was killing him. There was no way we could afford to get him to a state that could help him fast enough to stop what we both knew was coming and even told the DCFS representative and officer. Even working two jobs as I do and the 4 that my husband does. There was a small hope that once they could see his seizures returning, and his Doctor’s recommendations that they would see we were not any of those other types of the parents that they see so often it hardens their hearts to only seeing laws and what the state deems acceptable parenting. Maybe they would allow me just enough time to get him to the help of a medical center in an appropriate state. Within14 hours of the marijuana being stopped without consulting his Doctor, even with the safer seizure medications still administered, his service dog was alerting my husband as I was filling out paperwork for the DCFS office, David’s eyes filled with dread, fear, and hopelessness as all Matthew could do was watch it happen and get him to the hospital, and before my heart could even beat, he was in the grips of this horrible, evil, monster that threatens his life again. We felt sure they would see now. We felt sure they would not be able to ignore the obvious and blatant evidence in front of their faces, and the loss of childhood in our son’s face. This was not correct. While our son fought for his life, officially in DCFS custody and flatlining 15 times according to medical records, my husband was arrested, they tore me from my baby’s side and told me they were going to take custody of him as I was arrested too. They say he is not safe with us while a medical team tries to start his heart again because they have stopped his treatment by what they know of the law and their opinion. Then by opinion of the hospital’s police staff, my son’s service dog was removed and put into the city pound without allowing me the federally mandated, and legally protected, reasonable amount of time to seek someone to take custody of her. The officer from what I understand of the service dog laws outlined by the ADA website, violated federal law that protects these working animals and their handlers. We broke a state law in hopes of saving my son. In turn, our son’s federal rights as protected under the ADA laws were violated because of ignorance of what the laws state regarding service animal identification, and the federal laws dictating how a service dog with an incapacitated handler must be treated. How do we at the least help this department repair their ignorance of the federal laws? I asked people who advocate for the understanding of laws concerning service animals if I was incorrect in what I read. They explained what the laws state for each thing specifically that happened. They cannot legally tell me who was right or wrong as we all have a right to tell our own side of every story without the assumption of guilt. On my own reporting, I did, in fact, understand the laws that I believe were violated. I now have an obligation to become an advocate myself when our son is back in our arms and living his beautiful, young life.She is our son’s link to the conscious world when he is trapped in the grips of those seizures and cannot cry for help himself. She is his voice, his hero, and his Angel. She has a job that has improved all of our lives from him choking on his own vomit in his sleep because she will make sure someone hears her and gets to him. Instead of being treated as a valuable life and life saving dog, she was thrown into her own type of prison for 7 days. “Actually innocent, but decidedly guilty based on ignorance of the law” is what I would name that kind of charge. Seven days this life saving animal went without anyone she knew, strange foods, strange scheduling, strange dogs (who knows if they were friendly or not), exposure to a myriad of diseases, and was treated like an animal thrown away.  Vaccinations are our first line defense, but they do, on occasion fail our dogs. She risks that when she leaves our house. Just as we risk being attacked by a shark if we swim in the ocean. We know the risk, and that is why we do not jump into known, high shark activity laden waters with an open wound. Pounds cannot help except to be a possible breeding ground for diseases. They must house stray dogs whether they know the histories of the dogs or not. They cannot deny going and picking up a dog reported just because they do not know if it has had vaccinations. They can quarantine if equipped for that, and if the pound has adequate space and vet staff. Our son’s service dog is priceless in alerting to get David help, and she was cast aside just like our son’s childhood and quality of life. She has this way that is unique to them to speak to his whole mind and assure him that he is going to open his eyes to her again. She is amazing, and deserves to always be treated as such. We do not want to risk losing the only link we have to him to assure him that Matt and mommy are fighting for him when he cannot see and hear us. This wonderful, furry, angel tells him so. She wants her boy back almost as much as we do.Because of all of this, we want to move our child and family to a state with the medical resources to help him. We have found a lawyer who is the best of the best. She has reviewed and has been very optimistic in her ability to help us get our son back, and move him to a place where he can be monitored with regulated, specially grown marijuana that is designed to treat his individual needs uniquely. Our son deserves life. I am asking for help to save our son. Please donate if you are able so that we can hire this attorney and save him. If you are unable to donate, please understand that we are in deepest appreciation of prayers for our son to be okay and be a little boy riding his bike, and looking forward to going to school again, and so proud and excited when he learns new things and makes good grades. This just hurts so badly. We feel so afraid for him, and everything in both of us cries and screams to save him. We do not know if he is being cared for like a child or a case number. We only hear things that bother us deeply, and all we can do is turn it over to the lawyer to now fight the greatest battle of our lives in having our heart returned to us safe and sound and knowing that we now know the correct path of helping him, and can do this the legal way. It has proven to be the correct way by the medical evidence of only 71 days alone. Please, help us if you are able. We only want our baby back and to see him play and grow without fear of these seizures that were stealing him away from us before he was taken away by DCFS. We want all of him back, and have proven that we will do anything to protect him. The difference is that now, we are educating ourselves on the correct way, and imagining an even better outcome for his health with the proper care.Thank You! https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid?sharetype=teams&member=227462&rcid=r01-152732054834-745a05a4a60247a6&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m",988,2.5k,20,959,3 months,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She has an amazing story below, having already survived a previously incurable cancer. Please share her story with your social networks so we can raise awareness! We would deeply appreciate you helping her to write a happy ending, again. *** “For nearly as long as I can remember I have referred to Lexi Thomas as my sister. While she is technically my sister-in-law, that couldn’t matter less. She is a light in the world.” I first wrote those words 19 months ago, well before we could have known how Lexi’s journey would unfold. Lexi had been diagnosed with a cancer so rare that it had never been seen in a living patient, and after four years of fighting to stay alive, we found that we needed to raise thousands of dollars very quickly to get her into a high-risk, high-reward clinical trial. That trial was to be her last chance at life, culminating in a “reaction” that would either cause her death, or she would live and be cured.  With the help of more than 500 amazing individual donors we raised the money in time, got Lexi into the trial, and prayed for a miracle. On November 7th, her reaction came. Surrounded by her doctors from NIH, Duke and John’s Hopkins, her brain swelled, her heart stopped, and she died. For twenty long minutes, she was gone. But, we got our miracle. With a Herculean effort from her doctors, she fought to come back to us, and months later we found out that she had indeed beaten the previously incurable cancer. Not only did Lexi come back to us, she came back whole, and with a purpose. In the year that followed, more than 10,000 people, many of them young adults living with cancer, became readers of Lexi’s blog. The National Cancer Institute honored her with their “Young Adult of Great Influence” Award at the Angel Ball in New York City, and she got a boyfriend, of whom we all totally approve. Please check out her blog here if you would like to learn more about her story:  https://lexthomas11.wordpress.com We have started this new GoFundMe because while the incurable cancer remains beaten, Lexi again finds herself struggling to survive, this time fighting an aggressive new lymphoma that sprang up seemingly out of nowhere. As of this writing, she has been given 4-6 months to live if she doesn’t get treatment, and she’s again fighting like hell to stay with us, applying to every trial she might fit.  After being rejected from 211 trials in just the last nine months, lucky number 212 said yes! Now we have to raise the money to get her into this highly effective, and much safer immunotherapy trial. As before, this is likely her last chance at life, and we very much need to ask for your help again to beat this. In order to get into the trial, Lexi needs to start a new chemotherapy just a few weeks from now to keep her tumors from progressing. Radiation therapy has burned her too badly, and so this chemotherapy is her last option. The cost for the trial is a staggering $180,000. Fortunately, she only needs to put down a downpayment of $18,000 to start, but this does not count her bagged nutrition which costs $1,974 a week, her IV antibiotics, her hyperbaric chamber therapy to treat her radiation burns, and a litany of other expenses. Her medical debt now exceeds $300,000, but for now we want to raise $75,000 to get her into the trial and cover her critcial medical expenses for the next several months. Two years ago this community came together and helped to save Lexi’s life. She’s ready to fight again, and we need to ask you to help us make one more miracle for this young woman who has so powerfully touched so many lives. Please consider supporting this urgent goal, and make sure to share this campaign on your social networks. People often wonder if charitable campaigns are real, and it really, really helps to have folks who know and care about Lexi letting the world know that she is real, the need is real, and that they have a great opportunity to give the gift of life. Your support would mean the world to Lexi, and to our family. #lexistrong",738,1.0k,6,745,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

After initial chemotherapy and getting the tumor removed in her leg, doctors treated her with more intense chemotherapy. Nadia never once lost her determined and brave optimism. She always remained positive and faithful (and funny)!Just as she was about to be cleared of cancer this beginning of May, Nadia developed intense pain in her back and shoulder. Doctors found her lungs full of fluid. They also found additional micrometastases in both her lungs.  The path forward is not yet known, but we do know that Nadia is a fighter and that God can work incredible miracles. While asking is never easy, a full-time job for her mother is no longer possible. Nadia needs her mama and advocate by her side throughout the journey.  Any monetary donations to help with premium medical expenses, keep the lights on at home, keep mom by her side, and provide her with her favorite meals would be a beautiful and appreciated gift.

This diagnosis was the culmination of our attempts to find a solution to months of breastfeeding issues. Needless to say, it was unexpected.God’s care and favor has already been evident. In the week since diagnosis, Stephany has been able to meet with specialists and oncologists - a process that usually takes weeks, not days. Perhaps most notable is that Stephany and I were able to gain admission to a clinic that specializes in immunotherapy and holistic treatment of cancers, just two days after we received her diagnosis. This clinic has very high success rates when treating breast cancer. God’s favor in this cannot be understated; an appointment like this usually takes 2-3 months to secure.Please be in sustained prayer for Stephany, me, and our family as we journey down the long road of treatment and healing. Cancer diagnoses are never easy. But we know God. He has already done so much for us in this time, and we know he will continue to carry Stephany moving forward. We feel blessed to know we are surrounded by faith-filled, bible-practicing, Godly people, who are helping us to in our time of need. And because of people like you, we know that we don’t have anything to be anxious about as we work towards Stephany’s recovery.There’s certainly more that could be said, but for now I wanted to post to share with everyone and to ask for prayer. We will continue to share updates throughout this process.We love and are thankful for everyone and their support during this season.

-----------------------From Team Steph:The cancer that Steph has been diagnosed with is very aggressive. According to the Oncologist, the reason the cancer was not discovered any earlier was due to Steph breastfeeding her newborn, making detection incredibly challenging. Steph went from thinking she merely had mastitis to a full blown Stage IV Breast Cancer diagnosis. The reason it is stage IV is because it has spread to her lymphatic system, bones, liver, and lungs. The Oncologist wanted to start chemotherapy as soon as possible (apparently the person who installs the port for chemotherapy was on a vacation, so Steph wouldn’t be able to begin for another week). The Oncologist also wanted to put Steph in an immunotherapy, clinical trial, because he saw she was a good candidate for such recourse.Along with her Primary Care Physician, husband, and other counsel, Steph decided she wanted to further explore the immunotherapy approach. With the help of friends, the Dailey’s were able to hone it down to 3 specific clinics who were both reputable and experienced with this particular kind of cancer. Receiving her Stage IV diagnosis on Thursday morning, by Friday night Steph had two phone consultations with two different clinic doctors, and on Saturday was given a spot at the most reputable and successful of the clinics (the only of the clinics to have 3 American Certified Surgeon Oncologist on Staff and on location) - she would be able to move in and bring her newborn and husband that Sunday afternoon. Her treatment would begin with 20 intensive days as an in-patient. This hospital does a fusion of alternative and conventional forms of treatment, and her exact therapies and medicines would be prescribed upon arrival. They will take baseline measurements, including tumor markers to track progress. Chemo is still a likely possibility. She would then return home with a potent regimen of vitamins, meals, and other cancer treatment pharmaceuticals. Then she would return for a 7 day intensive to follow up, including retaking tumor markers, and then the Doctors would be able to suggest the next course of action. Because the clinic allowed Steph admission so quickly, the Dailey’s were not able to secure the funds in time, so rather than delaying until money was raised, the cost was negotiated to be paid with a deposit on a credit card (to be paid back through fundraising, God willing) and to have a future, upcoming payment to continue treatment (including the home regimen and 7 day follow up) due approximately 2 weeks from now - August 31st, 2018. On behalf of Steph, we are asking for a total of $50,000. $35,000 is for the 20 days of intensive in-patient treatment, plus the robust 3-month home therapy regimen, and the 7 day in-patient follow up back at the clinic. Another $5,000 is for the travel cost and related incidentals, roundtrip to the clinic both times. $10,000 is for other cancer treatment related costs while she’s at home for 3 months in between clinic stays, broken down to about $100 per day. This includes being able to switch the Dailey family over to non-toxic household products, and other related approaches to having a toxic free home. There are likely other costs, but at this time it is unpredictable as to what they would be considering how early Steph is into the treatment. However, this amount will be able to give the Dailey’s a sense of security related to their finances and keep Steph receiving the treatment she so desperately needs. If you can donate frequent flyer miles to help with travel, or have access to other resources for cancer patients, please contact us and let us know!Please join us in “Saving Steph.” Pray with us. Generously give with us.

Medical,13,Lauren's Killing Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/lauren039s-killing-cancer-fund,"WEST PALM BEACH, FL","July 25, 2018","$75,000","$62,025","Many of you are familiar with my business partner and my best friend, Lauren Greaves.  For those of you who don’t know Lauren well… She is firecracker. Gorgeous.  Funniest human I know.  A hot mess most days (in a good way), a super loyal friend, a blessed sister, daughter, aunt and all around crazy-awesome human being.  I for one, am blessed to have her in my life and I will do whatever I can do to KILL HER CANCER!  She is one of those friends who we all pray we find.  She is the type of friend who you can rely on and the one who always answers her phone at any hour of the day or night…. The one human in your life who will always deliver you pizza (or wine) at 2AM because that is ALL you need at that very moment to keep your sanity.  She is that person to me but also to countless others.  She is the best person I know.  Surprisingly, in May 2018, Lauren was diagnosed with cancer.  Aggressive Cancer.  The story:Two years ago, by way of self-examination, Lauren noticed a small lump on her breast. As an active 31-year-old, she thought little of it, but decided to do the prudent thing and visit the doctor for a consultation. After a brief examination, she was casually informed that the area of concern was in fact, benign, and there was nothing to worry about. So, Lauren went on living her life as she normally did, that is, until May of 2018… During what was intended to be a routine check-up, Lauren mentioned to her doctor that she felt like the benign lump had grown since her last visit. Shortly thereafter, she was thrown into a series of scans, tests, pokes and prods in an effort to determine what the growth was and why it had changed so drastically. Anyone who has been even remotely suspected of having cancer can attest to the fact that the following days/ weeks searching for a definitive conclusion can be the most grueling and mentally challenging as the prognosis seemingly changes minute by minute.  All that said, on May 15th, Lauren was diagnosed with Stage 3 Invasive Intraductal Carcinoma of the right breast. Beyond this, her cancer is “aggressive,” having already manifested itself in her lymph nodes. Should it continue beyond her lymph nodes, the doctors would deem it metastatic, or simply put, a death sentence. However, she is “lucky,” and her diagnosis, albeit Stage 3, is treatable. While the prognosis is optimistic, Lauren still has a long road ahead of her. Her killing-cancer journey begins with 8 rounds of an aggressive form of Chemotherapy (AC-T) AKA “The Red Devil.”  Her treatment started July 12thand will continue bi-weekly until late October. From there, she is allotted a brief two-week “vacation” from the drugs to heal, then a scan to make sure there was in fact a reduction in the size of tumors and then onto prep for her impending Double Mastectomy and Lymph Node Removal. Following those procedures, she will undergo Phase 1 of Reconstruction, immediately followed by 30 rounds of Radiation. After radiation, the second phase of reconstruction commences and if all goes according to plan, Lauren will be on the road to recovery by late spring 2019. In the meantime, her doctors have begun preparing her for full loss of hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, and even possibly fingernails and toenails. An additional bi-product of the chemotherapy is typically extensive damage to the ovaries and eggs.  Since Lauren has not had children of her own (YET), over the past 8 weeks she has been attempting to freeze her eggs in hopes of possibly, one day, having a biological child. Sadly, during the process, she was also diagnosed with a condition called DOR, or Diminished Ovarian Reserves, meaning she doesn’t have many eggs to freeze. She reluctantly delayed her chemo in order to try and squeeze in a second round of IVF, as the first round was less than fruitful. Although insurance covers infertility for men, it does NOT cover infertility for women, even with a Cancer diagnosis (BANANAS! Can you imagine this nonsense?). Each round is between $15,000 - $18,000. As her Cancer is estrogen-based, Lauren will also be induced into menopause at the age of 33 and remain there for at least 10 years in hopes of deterring the cancer from returning. Menopause is no-joke for a 50+ year old woman but for a robust 33 year old… I can’t express to you the mental anguish.  Trust me, this is NOT something any woman wants to face, especially NOT Lauren! My goal with this Go-Fund-Me page is help Lauren pay off her egg retrievals (which she already owes $32,000) but also help her fund some of the cancer-killing treatments.  Although Lauren is employed and Sarah and I will work our tails off to make sure she has a steady income, she will be working less and obviously taking in less income for the next 1-2 years.  Additionally, Lauren has less than desirable insurance and I would love to be able to help her pay some of her insurmountable medical bills.   Anything you can to help Lauren, ANY AMOUNT BIG OR SMALL is much appreciated and will not go unnoticed.    Sincerely and with much love and appreciation,Sabra Kirkpatrick and Sarah Koenig",325,1.1k,10,322,1 month,9 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

It is hard to believe that we are writing this about the situation facing our good friend Duncan Campling and his family.Duncan is 47 years old, & at the prime of his life, suffered a devastating Brain Stem Stroke on March 15, 2018. The news about Duncan is very  hard to comprehend, because he was healthy, going on about with his life and suddenly he had a stroke and was hospitalized in critical condition in the intensive care Unit.We have launched this GoFundMe campaign because this situation has a huge financial impact on Duncan and his young family; both in terms of covering the costs of his long-term care and his ability to provide for his family. Duncan needs our support. The simple facts are that this devastating ‘brain-stem stroke’ has left him in a long-term state of almost total incapacity. His medical care team is labeling his condition as “Locked-In syndrome”, which among other things means he has severe paralysis and is currently only able to communicate via eye and head movement. Duncan has full cognitive function and is fully aware of his situation. He has been moved from the hospital ICU to an Acute Therapy Hospital in suburban Philadelphia.Duncan has been an amazing and reliable friend to many people for so many years. We all know Duncan as gregarious, adventurous, full of life, easy to talk to, quick to laugh and make others laugh, generous and always one to pitch in and help whenever needed. More importantly Duncan has been an amazing husband to Veronica and loving father to Brent, 7 yrs old and Jason, 5 yrs old.Due to the severe and ongoing nature of Duncan's condition, there is serious concern about the costs involved in his long-term care as his insurance options start to diminish. We have set up this ‘gofundme’ page to help Duncan, Veronica, Brent and Jason for two reasons: -        To raise funds to address Duncan’s long-term care needs and provide supplementary aid for his family during this period of transition.-        To raise funds for medical equipment that will help Duncan regain as much independence as possible during recovery. Duncan needs among others specific technology such as an eye-tracking computer system to allow communication and a specialized, motorized wheelchair. Duncan is a fighter and has been intensely focused and determined to regain function through intensive therapy.

His parents were with him throughout his treatment in New Haven and his mom has used all of her available vacation time to do that. Insurance doesn’t cover 100% of the treatment and medicines and doesn’t cover any of the travel, lodging and other expenses that the family incurred. We would like to raise money for the Dolphan family to help them with these unexpected expenses so that they can continue to focus on helping Ike with his recovery.Any amount that you might be able to contribute is helpful and greatly appreciated.

In late September 2017, John returned from a work trip in Sydney, and his jet lag just wouldn't go away. A week later, he went to the ER, and a blood test discovered some blast cells. Two days later John was admitted into the Blood Cancer Institute of Colorado and diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. After 4 months in the hospital, a stem cell transplant, and many months of what seemed to be a promising recovery, John & Sarah recently learned that John has relapsed. While the doctors are doing everything they can to accelerate the next step of treatment, John & Sarah could really use our help. For anyone who has had the unfortunate experience of having a loved one with cancer, you know that one of the hardest parts can be keeping up with the realities of life, as you battle daily to fight for the life of the one you love most. It's draining, exhausting, full of beautiful moments of grace, and some of despair. Juggling your life's responsibilities (work, kids, bills, etc.) with an avalanche of new demands can take it's toll on the strongest of people.  We've set up this GoFundMe to help provide funds to Sarah & John so they have the space and lift they need to gather their strength as they gear up to continue this fight. Sarah has been covering all of their responsibilities and expenses since John learned he was sick, and as her orca pod, we'd like to help. Always the first to donate to a cause (I think the ACLU and World Wildlife Fund have her account flagged), we'd like to give back to both of them so that they can take the time and space they need to focus on each other, and John's healing. Sending you all lots of love, and endless gratitude for thinking of them both.

(He is my husband's nephew, but in reality he is more like a brother to both of us, someone we spend the majority of our weekends with on the lake, in the woods and around the campfire.)  Dan has been an active outdoorsman his entire life, spending nearly all of his spare time camping, fishing, hunting, boating and enjoying life with his fiance and best friend, Ashley, as well as his family and friends. Everywhere Dan goes he has his two young children, Natalee and Nicholas, in his arms or attached to his hip. A highly productive individual, he is an extremely valued employee and a foreman with our company. Honest, hard-working and loyal, Dan is absolutely irreplaceable. He is smart, practical, independent and motivated, and he is admired, loved and respected by everyone around him. Dan has always, always been ready and willing at any given moment to help his family and friends ( and even strangers) no matter their needs or situations.The accident.On March 20, 2018 Dan was performing his job duties as a mechanical insulator, installing pipe insulation on piping located approximately 20' above ground. Working out of a scissor lift with a platform, he extended to reach a section of pipe when he lost his balance and fell to the dirt and gravel floor below. Upon impact with the ground he suffered multiple broken ribs, a punctured lung, a broken scapula, and burst fractures of his T9 and T10 vertebrae.Diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.Dan was immediately transported to UPMC Hamot and has undergone surgery to stabilize his spine. He will endure another surgery to repair his scapula before he is transferred to an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh on or around March 28.Dan has suffered a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) below the vertebral fracture sites, effectively losing all feeling and movement below the middle of his abdomen. The neurosurgeon has indicated that his paralysis is permanent.Upon transfer from the ICU in Hamot to the acute rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh, he will endure an intense 4-6 week therapy program to prepare him for his return home.Dan's life after SCIDan will have a team of physicians and therapists in Pittsburgh that he will be visiting frequently after his release from the rehab program. Additionally, Dan will continue outpatient rehabilitation closer to home.It is Dan's goal that he will return to many, if not all, of his previous hobbies as well as work in the future. His family and friends have been working tirelessly since the accident to assemble a solid support system to help him reach his goals.Dan will need renovations to his home. However, even with these changes, his current home will not be able to serve as his permanent home. There are an abundance of safety issues and there is no way to adequately expand the home to provide him the space he needs.In addition to the impending struggles of trying to adjust to their new life, especially with two young children, Dan and Ashley will need a new ADA-designed and equipped home in the near future.How can Dan's family and friends help?Dan, Ashley and their family are grateful to the innumerable amount of people who have reached out to them asking how they can help. After much careful thought, assistance toward a safe and comfortable home has been determined to be the greatest need. Preliminarily, they have every intention to stay as close as possible to their immediate family. We are hoping that we can alleviate some of the burden that comes with such a major life change and help them with a home that fits their family's new needs.There are no words to express how thankful we all are for your thoughtfulness, your compassion, your contributions and your willingness to support Dan, Ashley, Natalee and Nicholas.",242,811,3,235,5 months,4 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Doctors were able to eradicate 3 of the tumors with Gamma Knife radiosurgery but the 4th tumor was too large for Gamma Knife and required brain surgery.  I had brain surgery, started taking targeted therapy medication and went back to living my life for the next 10 months until the medication stopped working.  New scans showed that I had 3 new brain tumors.  Doctors treated these tumors with Gamma Knife, discontinued the targeted therapy medication and put me on immunotherapy infusions.  A few months into this and one of the tumors that had been previously treated started to enlarge; I had to have a 2nd brain surgery.In the summer of 2016, a few months after my 2nd brain surgery, scans showed that melanoma was now in my spine.  I had radiation and started on a clinical trial.  Within months, I started experiencing back pain.  Cancer had returned to my spine and I needed surgery.  After the surgery, I experienced a major complication; my intestines perforated and I almost died.  I had to have emergency surgery and an ileostomy.  If you don’t know what an ileostomy is, trust me, it was awful.  With this complication, I could not be on any cancer treatment and so in early 2017, the cancer returned to my spine and I had to have my 2nd spine surgery and 2nd round of radiation.  A few months later, I had surgery to get rid of my ileostomy; which was great but I’m still not the same, at least as far as my guts are concerned.Whenever I meet a new doctor who has seen my chart but never met me, they are always surprised.  They tell me that I look a lot better in person than I do on paper and that I am lucky to be alive.  I have a tremendous support team.  My wife Dana has been by my side every step of the way and I truly don’t think I would be alive if it weren’t for her.  She is amazing.This past few weeks have been rough.  My most recent scans show a new tumor in my brain and enlarging tumors in my spine and lymph node.  I will have Gamma Knife tomorrow to take care of the tumor in my brain.As for my spine, the surgeons and radiologists that I have consulted with are concerned that a 3rd surgery or 3rd dose of radiation to my spine could cause permanent damage.  My radiologist has referred me to Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York.  MSK recommends proton therapy as the safest way to alleviate the tumor on my spine.  Unfortunately, my insurance does not agree and has deemed this as “not medically necessary”.  “Not medically necessary” Hearing these words has been shocking and stressful.  Up until now, insurance has always paid their part and I have always paid mine.  I will appeal this decision, but in the meantime, a big part of what has kept me alive so far is moving forward based on the recommendations of experts.  I will not let this slow me down and am moving forward.  I have my initial appointment at the proton therapy center on Friday.As for the lymph node, my oncologist has referred me to MD Anderson in Houston where I would have surgery to remove the lymph node and hopefully will be a candidate for their TIL program – more on that later as we are still working on getting this moving.  When I sat down to write this, I didn’t intend for it to be so long.  But then I guess it has been a long journey. We’ve had so many friends and family help us with childcare, meals, shoveling snow, mowing our grass, praying and taking the time to ask how I am doing.  People Dana and I didn’t really know at the start of this have stood by our side and have become our best friends.  The support we have received has made all the difference.  Now as the cancer is progressing, and we are having to travel out of state to get the medical care I need, Dana and I are dealing with coordinating three different hospitals in three different states, travel, insurance, child care, missing work.   We are overwhelmed, scared and stressed.  A family member reminded me that there are many people out there who don’t live close but have asked what they can do - they can’t bring me dinner or watch my kids, but want to help – so, if you are one of those people, maybe you could help with this and check back every once in a while, to see how I am doing  My family:Some pictures from 2009:Gamma Knife Radiosurgery - this is what I have to look forward to tomorrow!After brain surgery - the baseball team I help coach signed this bat for me:)This was my first of many infusions!More surgeries:",254,439,9,255,2 months,12 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

I am a happy, fun loving boy who enjoys being around my family and playing with my friends. Some of my favorite activities include playing with trains, swimming in my new pool, and learning at school. On April 3rd, 2018 I was watching my favorite show when I began having a seizure. My mommy saw me having a seizure and called 911. They rushed me to the hospital where they began doing many tests including a scan of my head where they found a mass on my brain. This came as a major shock to my mommy and daddy. The doctors found that the mass on my brain was a tumor that needed to be operated on. On April 10th, I had brain surgery to remove the tumor and the doctors thought it looked “funny”. They sent it away to John Hopkins Children’s Hospital , St. Jude Children’s Research, and The University Stanford to identify what the tumor was. Unfortunately, it was determined that my tumor was in deed cancerous and of high grade. The doctors said that my tumor is Grade 4, Highly Aggressive Embryonal Cancer. As you could imagine, this broke mommy and daddy’s heart and made us all very scared. We don’t know what to expect, but we are hoping and praying for the best. The doctors said that I am going to need to undergo chemo therapy. There is a 65% chance that this cancer can be treated with chemo therapy, but 35% chance it can return. I am going to be going through 3-6 months of high dose chemo therapy to help stop the cancer from returning. The doctors say that I am going to be very sick as the chemo therapy is going to cause me to lose my hair, appetite and strength. I don't really understand what is going on, but I know mommy and daddy do and I can see that they are very scared. I am going to be staying at Jack Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami until I am better. Daddy is going to be supporting us by traveling back and forth to work and the hospital to be with me and mommy. Mommy is going to be with me around the clock and wont be able to work. As I go through this challenging next 3-6 month, I ask for your prayers to help me stay strong and for this cancer to never come back. I can't wait to be able to jump in my pool, play with my trains at home, and play with my friends once I get through this chemo therapy. I ask that you please help mommy and daddy in any way you can. They will be short income from mommy not being able to work and the medical bills they will have to deal with from me being sick.

Brother Natnael lost his father when he was 2 years old. Since his mother was unable to raise 3 boys by herself, she had to let Natnael live with his aunt. Life was very tough for him growing up. He lived through unbearable stress and physical abuse. He later developed a brain tumor that doctors believed caused by stress. He lost his vision because of the brain tumor. Doctors in Ethiopia don't have the means to perform this type of surgery. There is a hope for this young man to get his vision back but the procedure has to be done outside of Ethiopia. The family don’t have the means to cover the medical and travel expenses so we initially established this gofundme account to send Nathy to India for the procedure but with your overwhelming donations and support Nathy now has the opportunity to come to USA . We have currently raised $36,432 and need to get to 50,000.00.

Medical,15,Help my mom fight brain cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/5csg4-help-my-mom-fight-brain-cancer,"LOS ANGELES, CA","July 18, 2018","$100,000","$61,533","On June 18th, 2018 — the day after my last graduation ceremony — my mother was rushed to the ER after excruciating migraines that left her unable to walk and talk. Shortly after, we received the devastating diagnosis that she had an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor. Now, she is fighting for her life against stage IV brain cancer.


My Mom’s Story

For more than ten years, my mom worked as a restaurant waitress to single-handedly provide for our family of six. She regularly clocked over 100 hours a week and rarely took any time off in the decade that she spent waiting tables for thousands of customers. She taught herself the little English that she knows from memorizing menu items and took immense pride in being able to bring joy to people’s lives by serving them delicious food. For as long as I can remember, my mother’s always been a fighter. When my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare blood condition with no cure called hemophilia, she quickly learned from nurses how to inject medication to allow him to live a normal life. When my father was repeatedly incarcerated for domestic violence and drug addiction, she found ways to provide us safe, healthy, and nurturing environments to grow up in. My mother has survived homelessness and food insecurity, abuse and assault, and all while raising two kids and caring for her aging parents. Above all else, she’s modeled resilience, strength, and positivity in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Now, she’s facing what she considers to be just another hurdle to overcome: cancer. What HappenedMy family saved money for months to be able to afford to attend my graduation weekend at UCLA. My mom was especially excited — it was her first real vacation in years and it was also her first time visiting California. However, throughout their stay, she began to experience increasingly aggressive migraines that left her bedridden. For years, my mom has had regular headaches and bouts of forgetfulness, but we always thought that it was from her overworking herself at the restaurant.After she was sent to the ER, we learned that these weren’t normal signs of exhaustion; they were symptoms of an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor called glioblastoma, which has a five-year survival rate of just 5%.Once my mom was admitted to the hospital, doctors found that her tumor had grown so much that brain matter that should have been in the middle of her head had been pushed all the way to one side. Neurosurgeons had to place a shunt in her brain to relieve the pressure of the swollen mass. In the last month, her condition has quickly deteriorated; she’s been put on breathing tubes, her muscles have withered away, and she's been put on an intense regime of steroids, antibiotics, and other medication.The Road AheadMy mom has always been vigorously active, from working as a physical education teacher in China to dashing between tables as a waitress in Michigan. She’ll be transitioning from a fiercely independent lifestyle to one where she’ll need assistance with simple tasks like using the restroom and brushing her teeth. The initial bill that we received after only one week of hospitalization was almost $148,000. This amount has since tripled and is still growing. Because my mom is not a California resident, we’ve faced immense challenges with enrolling her for any form of emergency health insurance or financial support, even with the help of social workers and financial counselors.We’re extremely fortunate that she was able to undergo a partial tumor removal surgery at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. This intensive procedure removed a piece of the tumor that was the size of a hand. Now, she’ll need extensive physical and speech therapy, as well as months ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. If we’re lucky, she’ll be able to qualify for clinical trials. All of these amount to significant out-of-pocket costs. As the only immediate family member besides my sixteen-year-old brother who can speak fluent English and drive, I’ll be my mother’s primary caregiver in the months (and, hopefully, years) to come. I’ve decided to put my dream of attending law school on the backburner because our priority now is to give my mom the best life possible with the best treatment possible. It’s a daunting task, but one that I also consider an honor: to be able to take care of the person who has protected and nurtured us through some of life’s roughest storms. But to be honest, I can’t do this alone. In addition to overseeing my mom’s medical needs, I’ll also be caring for my elderly grandparents, raising my brother and helping him with applying to college in the fall, paying for our living expenses, finishing up classes for my degree, and completing a fellowship.Sometimes, it almost feels like too much. There’s nothing more terrifying than watching the person you love most slowly wither away before your eyes. This last month has been the most challenging time of my life and my biggest fear is that my mom won’t be able to get the care she needs because we can’t afford to foot the medical bill, or don’t have the money to get gas for the car. I’ve spent days writing and rewriting this plea for help. Any amount of support, whether it’s a single dollar or sharing this GoFundMe, would be immensely appreciated by my family.Thank you for helping me give my mom a fighting chance.",1.7k,2.5k,2,"1,708",1 month,14 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is a light in this world that needs our help to shine as bright as she possibly can.Sara’s doctors are recommending 4 concurrent treatments to win this fight. In addition to that, Sara is incorporating treatments that will attack the cancer in a progressive way. All of these treatments will be costly. Sara has some protection in place with a Critical Illness rider on one of her life policies.

The challenges of this have furthered my appreciation for friendship, family, community, and heightened my view of what we do every day to help one another. I will be forever grateful for the thoughtfulness and support I have received. Although it is challenging for me to accept contributions to my recovery, I resolve to pay back this generosity tenfold. If there is one objective in my time left in this world, it will be to give back and inspire.

Medical,15,Viorel Nitica Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/ViorelNiticaMedicalFund,"West Chester, PA","April 15, 2018","$150,000","$63,861","My name is Ana Nitica and I am creating this GoFundMe campaign on behalf of my beloved husband of almost 32 years, Viorel Nitica, at the urging of our family, friends, colleagues, and many people whose lives he has touched.  Viorel has been diagnosed with glioblastoma and the insurance denied coverage for the proton radiation treatment that his doctor prescribed.  Together, we raised two wonderful sons and overcame numerous challenges, some of which were very serious.  Viorel took good care of his family, he enjoyed traveling and the trips at the amazing Longwood Gardens, and working.  Viorel dedicated most of his life to his research and teaching work, contributing a lot to the success of the Department of Mathematics at West Chester University of Pennsylvania where he is a Full Professor of Mathematics with tenure and taught more than 30 different courses.  He is spoken about very highly by his colleagues and students alike.  Viorel authored about 70 research papers, some of them published in prestigious mathematical journals, published two books, participated and gave talks at conferences in many countries, and did reviewer work for many scientific journals. Viorel received two National Science Foundation grants and received the prestigious Trustees Achievement Award from West Chester University.On February 25, 2018, I took Viorel to Chester County hospital because he suffered of headaches during the previous week, which became almost unbearable.  The hospital did a CAT-scan of Viorel’s brain and found a large abnormal deviation in the brain that can cause life threatening intracranial pressure and immediately transported him to the University of Pennsylvania Hospital for more testing and treatment. MRI tests revealed a tumor of diameter between 5 and 6 cm in his brain.On March 1st, more than 95 percent of the tumor was removed, and the surgeon found that it is was glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. We were in shock and took a long time for this to sink in.  The statistics for this are very gloomy, and we proceeded to learned more about it.  In addition to surgery, the treatment also requires radiation and chemotherapy that reduce the chance for a recurrent tumor, which is high.  Even more shocking was the news that because of the size of his tumor and the location, and the nature of the radiation (photon therapy), the treatment would likely leave him disabled in many ways, by damaging his vision, his hearing and his motor function; he may not be able to continue his lifelong passions teaching and research.We asked if something better is available and we were happy to learn that University of Pennsylvania Hospital also performs proton therapy.  The difference is quite remarkable.  Photon therapy (gamma rays, the most powerful electromagnetic radiation, more energetic than x-rays) goes into the tumor and through the brain, depositing energy along the beam path as photons pass through the target and then through an exit point out of the head through the other hemisphere, causing damage to healthy brain along the way.  In contrast, proton therapy deposits the bulk of the energy at the tumor site without affecting the surrounding normal brain.  Because of this, it allows for delivery of a higher dose of radiation without scatter and damage to the surrounding normal tissues in the brain, and thus causing far fewer side effects.  Doing the proton therapy along with chemotherapy will likely allow Viorel to return to his work to be a productive member of society and maintain a certain quality of life that he would lose otherwise.  Getting the proton therapy for Viorel’s tumor seemed to us like a “no-brainer” and the only appropriate course for him to take, and the doctor recommended it.  He said it would be the best thing for my husband, but it is much more expensive than photon radiation and getting the insurance to pay for it would be difficult.  We thought that we have very good insurance through the University and we decided to go for it.  We felt truly blessed to be close to the University of Pennsylvania and to such a wonderful team of doctors, and we are so grateful to them.  They made a solid treatment plan for Viorel.  The surgery and the recovery went well.  We were eager to start the next phase of his treatment.  We thought that the insurance company would surely support us when we are hit so hard.  Little did we know the harrowing journey one has to go through in the quest of getting appropriate care.  The insurance companies are for-profit institutions and to make those booming profits they do not want to pay for the most expensive treatments if they can get away with it.  So, the doctor requested proton therapy for Viorel’s glioblastoma (to preserve his neurocognitive function and spare him the horrendous side effects) and the request was denied.  The appeals to the insurance, accompanied by a letter of medical necessity from the doctor, were rejected.  Basically, it turned out that the insurance we get from the University is not on our side after all.  They would not pay for the protons when they can pay for a cheaper alternative.  The treatments with radiation and chemotherapy must start as soon as one heals after surgery.  There is no time to waste since the tumor can grow again, very fast.  We put half of the cost of the proton treatment on credit cards and we have 5 months to pay for the other half, and Viorel started the proton therapy on April 3 along with chemotherapy.  Viorel also changed his diet drastically and I am doing it along with him. The treatments are rough on him, but he is doing it and I still managed to catch him smile occasionally.  Viorel loves life and he is fighting for it.  We asked for help from the university and we will continue to do whatever we can to get the insurance to pay for the treatment.  We hope the insurance and the university will come through.  These payments put a huge burden on us and they cause us to fear for our financial future.  When we are so down and face death in the face, we feel the insurance and the university should be there for us.  Instead, they put us through an enormous amount of stress.  We still hope that eventually they will do the right thing.  The new proton guidelines recommend proton therapy for intracranial tumors.  We hope they will update their proton policies and pay for the treatment for Viorel.  But we can’t wait for years, and we can’t count on it.  The financial burden would snowball and overwhelm us.  We found out that so many people care about Viorel and would like to help us.  Viorel is not a person who expresses his feelings and emotions often (even though this changed a bit because of the brain tumor), but he is an amazing human being who loves his family and friends and he contributed so much to mathematics and positively touched the lives of so many students.  In his moment of need, many people who know Viorel expressed the wish to contribute and ease his financial burden on this new journey.  We are so grateful for their generosity and I am setting up this funding campaign to make it possible for people to help.  We need to raise about $150,000 at this time to cover the therapy and other expenses.   Extra money raised, possibly if the insurance reimburses us, will be used to cover related expenses that will show up in the future and Viorel will create a fund at the university to help students and others in their moment of need.  Thank you all for the kindness and support you have shown us and for the help you are willing to give us to help lighten our burden during this extremely difficult time.  Thank you for being here for us.  Thank you for your love and prayers.  Thank you.Ana (Magda)",279,278,10,283,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The results were encouraging, but the road was daunting. Adam spent 3 weeks at Good Samaritan Hospital and another 4 weeks recovering at St. Anthony’s Rehab. It was rough going—painful, frightening and humbling as Adam learned to walk again and gain enough functionality to return home and then endure months of radiation of the brain and spine. #fortitudeThrough 2017 Adam had repeated MRIs showing no new growth and Adam went back to his menschy ways without wasting any time—launching a new joint replacement company, spending time with Robin and helping everyone he could. #everydayisagiftBattle #2: Fast forward to Spring of 2018 when Adam faced an abrupt decline and shockingly learned he needed to endure another surgery to debulk the tumor compressing his spine and go back down the long road of surgery, rehab and recovery. Life got worse for Adam with a few frightening seizure episodes that appear as strokes and additional setbacks, which delayed and depleted his inpatient rehab. #shit As of Aug 12th, Adam has rinsed, washed and repeated this painful, debilitating cycle of surgery –> hospitalization –> rehab. Now, after three months of being under the fluorescent glow of a medical facility Adam is home again. Adam is making slow and steady progress reclaiming his self sufficiency with the support of the amazing team at Craig Hospital where they specialize in recovery from spinal injury. With every PT session, Adam get's a bit stronger. #progress Prognosis: During the most recent surgery the tumor was deeply entangled in the spinal column but the surgeons were able to resect nearly 100%. This very invasive surgery has caused injury to the spine leaving Adam currently unable to walk, and managing significant pain. Adam is doing intensive PT every day and the next 6 to 9 months will reveal how much lower body mobility will be recovered. #toughgoing What now?  For now, Adam is home, enjoying being with Robin and his father Len, considering his professional options, receiving outpatient Physical and Occupational Therapy and doing an excellent job being his guru-ish optimistic self. Adam currently requires a lot of support at home and he and Robin are looking into homecare to make life manageable which unfortunately is not covered by insurance.  Adam is the guy who worked as hard as he could on whatever project he was running, whatever event helped his community. Adam has always found a way to help his friends with their deck, their research and their personal issues.

We have been dealing with this disease for a year, and at this moment, we need as much help as possible to continue this battle. We were leaving in Cyprus when we learned about the disease. Immediately after learning about the tumor, Lucio, received 8 cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery in a period of 4 months.In Cyprus, they did not have the technology to continue with his treatment so we went to Berlin, Germany, hospital Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum. In Germany, we have done more chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant, and 5 cycles of immunotherapy.After a year of a successful treatment, there is still a 50%-60% chance for the cancer to come back, especially the first 2 years.Knowing this, we have contacted Dr Giselle Sholler of Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Michigan. She is doing medical studies to decrease the remission percentile of high risk neuroblastoma. This medical trial is bringing great hope to families like ours. The clinical trails have shown significant improvements in decreasing the high rates of relapses.

This specific medical trial is what offers Lucio the longest chance of survival, but we will need financial help. Because it is a medical trial, our health insurance covers nothing.In order to get the trial treatment, we need to financially cover the Marrow puncture, MBGI, Scan, and several trips to the U.S. It is a 2-year treatment, and we need to go to the U.S. five times and repeat these studies each time we go. We have no choice but to ask for your help. Lucio’s survival is not only in God’s hands, but all of us... There is a beautiful saying; “We need a village to raise a child.” Our son needs more than a village at this moment.We cannot thank you enough for your time and consideration. Mi nombre es Emiliano Fusco, de Buenos Aires, Argentina, a mi hijo de 3 años se le ha diagnosticado un cáncer muy difícil y poco común (neuroblastoma metastásico de alto riesgo N-MYC amplificado). Hemos estado lidiando con esta enfermedad durante un año, y en este momento, necesitamos tanta ayuda como sea posible para continuar esta batalla.Nosotros viviamos en  Chipre cuando nos enteramos de la enfermedad. Inmediatamente después de conocer el tumor, Lucio recibió 8 ciclos de quimioterapia seguidos de cirugía en un período de 4 meses.En Chipre, no tenían la tecnología para continuar con su tratamiento, así que fuimos a Berlín, Alemania, al hospital Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum.En Alemania, hemos realizado más quimioterapia, un trasplante de médula ósea y 5 ciclos de inmunoterapia.Después de un año de un tratamiento exitoso, todavía hay un 50% -60% de probabilidades de que el cáncer regrese, especialmente los primeros 2 años.Sabiendo esto, nos hemos puesto en contacto con la Dra. Giselle Sholler del Hospital Infantil Helen DeVos en Michigan. Ella está haciendo estudios médicos para disminuir el porcentaje de remisión del neuroblastoma de alto riesgo.Este ensayo médico está trayendo una gran esperanza a familias como la nuestra. Los ensayos clínicos han demostrado mejoras significativas en la disminución de las altas tasas de recaídas. Estos ensayos han ayudado al 86% de los pacientes infantiles a permanecer sin cáncer durante los primeros 4 años después de completar su tratamiento inicial.Por favor, consulte los enlaces para obtener más información:  www.beatcc.org https://youtu.be/x_VF4yqSnZM https://vimeo.com/111753551Hemos estado viviendo con esta enfermedad durante el último año. Al estar en Alemania, y con la incertidumbre y la inestabilidad de nuestra realidad, mi esposa y yo no hemos podido trabajar. Como consecuencia de esto, no podemos enfrentar la carga financiera sin ayuda comunitaria o colectiva.Como se puede imaginar, el estilo de vida de Lucio ha sido muy diferente en comparación con cualquier otro niño de 2 años, pero estamos agradecidos y bendecidos por seguir compartiendo nuestras vidas con él. Nuestra familia hará todo lo que esté a nuestro alcance para mantenerlo en nuestras vidas el mayor tiempo posible, así como para darle la oportunidad de disfrutar de una vida más larga.Este ensayo médico específico es lo que le ofrece a Lucio la mayor posibilidad de supervivencia, pero necesitaremos ayuda financiera. Debido a que es una prueba médica, nuestro seguro de salud no cubre nada.Para obtener el tratamiento de prueba, tenemos que cubrir financieramente la punción de médula, MBGI, escaner y varios viajes a los EE. UU. Es un tratamiento de 2 años, y tenemos que ir a EE. UU. Cinco veces y repetir estos estudios cadavez que vayamos.No tenemos más remedio que pedirle ayuda.La supervivencia de Lucio no está solo en las manos de Dios, sino de todos nosotros ...Hay un hermoso dicho; ""Necesitamos un pueblo para criar a un niño"". Nuestro hijo necesita más que un pueblo en este momento.No podemos agradecerte lo suficiente por tu tiempo y consideración.",541,1.1k,27,550,5 months,5 months ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,15,Keep Jack Walking,https://www.gofundme.com/keep-jack-walking,"NEWARK, OH","March 25, 2018","$50,000","$57,525","It has taken Jack 8 years, but he can now walk with canes, even though he cannot feel below the waist. Although he has overcome so much, the tumor in his spine caused scoliosis. Since birth his spine has progressed to a curve of 60 degrees. This is causing health issues and must be corrected. The standard procedure, covered by insurance,  to correct scoliosis in spinal cord injury children is to put ""magic rods"" in them until they are old enough to have their spine fused. The metal rods will restrict movement, making movement and basic life tasks even more difficult for someone with a SCI.  The rods replacement procedure is irreversible and prevents any benefits from future medical advances. It also will only correct his spine by 20 degrees.As a parent, I decided that I couldn't do this to my child. I knew there had to be another way. I researched, traveled to 3 different states/doctors. The first two doctors had the same suggestion, to put magic rods in him. They also told me there is a high probability he won't walk after the surgery because it will restrict his movement, which he needs for the leg weakness. The doctor in NYC also told me that he would prefer I do it closer to home, even though he has done the most of these surgeries (43) because the rods will likely results in complications, including painful brakes of the rods, requiring surgical corrections. So basically put the rods in to stop the spine from curving, but you are now going to deal with lots of complications and he won't be able to walk. The third doctor from the Institute for Spine and Scoliosis in New Jersey agreed that the rods would be terrible for Jackson. Thus, Dr. Betz and his team in New Jersey would do a surgery that uses a cord similar to a bungee cord to correct his spine. It also allows him to move his body, so he can continue to walk, and it is not permanent. The complications are minimal. After hearing about this unprecedented surgery, and talking to other families that have had this done, we were elated and should have known that it was too good to be true. A month ago they called to tell use our portion of the surgery, $50,000.00. We cannot even make an appointment for the surgery until we put $30,000.00 down. They do not participate with any insurance companies, so this amount is set. At this point we feel completely overwhelmed. I cannot put the rods in Jack and tell him that all of his hard work is for nothing, because this surgery isn't covered by our insurance. Asking for help is very difficult for me, and we have always managed to pay for his medical/travel bills to his appointments across the east coast. Everything that has come our way we have managed to figure it out. I have applied for grants, written letters to everyone who is involved with SCI that could possibly help, and I am continually turned down. $50,000.00 is beyond what we are capable of and are hoping that we can get some help to pay for this surgery for Jack. If you are able to donate we truly appreciate it, and if you are unable I understand too.",248,941,6,246,5 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Medical,16,Help Prakash fight Glioblastoma,https://www.gofundme.com/help-prakash-fight-glioblastoma,"LONGMONT, CO","June 30, 2018","$60,000","$56,647","Hi Everyone,I was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme  - the most aggressive form of Brain Tumor there is in November of 2016. I have chronicled in detail the journey since then at  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/02/the-story-so-far.html and subsequent blog posts.Very recently, on June 20th, 2018, we were told from an MRI report that the tumor is back in a different part of the brain:   http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/the-monster-rears-its-ugly-head.htmlThe tumor recurrence needs a brain surgery to be done in the next few weeks as surgery is the first line of defense against the tumor. Consequently, I will be unable to work and earn my living for a few weeks in the next couple of months.Things have become even more difficult for me and my family as I got into an unfortunate accident resulting in a couple of broken leg bones last weekend:  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/a-moments-bad-judgment-leads-to-serious.html

As I have explained in this 5-minute video at Ignite Boulder recently, tumor recurrence is a highly likely possibility for a Glioblastoma patient, and multiple tumor recurrences over a few years - each of which will need a brain surgery to address - is likely to kill the patient in a few years. There is room for hope despite this dire prognosis as innovative and effective treatments are being investigated to cure/handle this terminal brain cancer. Most notably, Duke University announced on Tuesday, June 26, 2018, about the impressive results they have observed from the Poliovirus Therapy Treatment in Phase 1 clinical trial. I am seriously investigating the possibility of me enrolling in this treatment at Duke University in the very near future.   http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/getting-serious-about-moving-to-durham.html Also, hoping for more innovative and effective treatments to come along in the near future to further expected lifespan while dealing with Glioblastoma.I am starting this fund-raiser to help me deal with Glioblastoma as effectively as possible while continuing to live as normal a life as possible.Even while I was in full-health before the brain surgery and terminal cancer diagnosis, I was having difficulty making ends meet as a freelance Ruby on Rails Developer. This problem has been worsened since the surgery in November of 2016, with ongoing treatments, physical and mental limitations from surgery and treatments, lack of a stable income/disability insurance to cover for expenses while I was not able to work/find work, and other factors. The situation has worsened even further since early 2018 because of increased costs of living - increased healthcare premiums, increased rents, increased expenses for support and  unconventional treatments (supplements, diet changes, running marathons, counseling, etc.)Almost every month since the original surgery in November 2016, I have faced a huge gap between my monthly income and the monthly expenses. I have been addressing these gaps with various strategies as follows:* Start a fund-raiser: I had one fund-raiser last year and got a very encouraging response from my friends, family, and well-wishers in the numerous communities I have been fortunate to have been part of.* Avoid/postpone paying bills: A big item in this category is my tax-filing for 2017. I filed for an extension and have not yet paid the taxes due for last financial year. Expecting the bill with penalties to be in the $15,000 range.* Withdraw from my retirement savings account:  Earlier in March of this year,  my bank balance was close to zero and I decided to clean out my retirement savings account instead of making it a habit of starting fundraisers on an annual basis.  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/03/time-for-another-fund-raiser-to-help-me.html* Charge everything to a Credit Card: There have been many big bills coming my way in the recent past from the treatments, as well as my wife's USMLE preparation work. Since all these expenses are unavoidable, I have been charging them to my credit cards. Consequently, I have raised a total of around $30,000 on credit card debts - $16,0000 on personal credit cards and $14,000 on a business credit card.* Reach out to close friends for private donations: In the last couple of months, 7 of my friends have helped me out to a tune of $7,000 through private donations with my financial situation.In addition to outlasting terminal cancer, I want to turn myself into a writer as I have been mulling around three memoir ideas:1. Years 1 & 2 with terminal cancer: A chronicle of my journey with Glioblastoma since the initial diagnosis to surviving the first two years. Hoping to write a short, inspirational and educative tome on this topic.2. How I turned myself from a 5-hour-marathoner to a 2.5-hour-marathoner and qualified for Boston Marathon as a middle-aged-man: Qualifying for Boston Marathon has been an inspirational goal for me for the past decade or so. I hope I will be able to turn myself from my current ability to finish marathons in 5 hours time-range to be able to finish in half that time, and document the process along the way in this memoir.3. Dear Aisiri - A letter to my 4 year-old-daughter: I hope to be around through my daughter's childhood, growing up to be a strong and independent woman, and become a parent herself. If Glioblastoma were to make that impossible and force my daughter to grow up without a father during her important formative years, I hope to leave behind a document that she can fall back on for inspiration and hope in the years to come. Any help you provide through this fund-raiser will go a long way in helping me and my family deal with Glioblastoma with a very positive attitude and increase our chances of outlasting this monster.

He had been living there for only a few weeks as part of his summer internship. The roommates immediately called an ambulance and Ishan was admitted to El Camino Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU).The seizures continued without mercy for the next several days, yet Ishan still showed signs of life. He required intubation for 4 days but miraculously regained consciousness on the 4th day and demonstrated gradual recovery, both in speech and cognition as the days progressed. Unfortunately, an MRI scan discovered a tumor in Ishan’s brain that now requires an immediate surgery, as recommended by his doctors. It is not known yet if the tumor is cancer.Ishan had received the only full-ride scholarship to a Nepali student offered by MIT every year, and had moved to the US in August 2017. A brilliant, kind-hearted, and promising student from Nepal, Ishan now faces financial challenges during and after the surgery-- months, if not years after. His family back in Nepal is already facing financial hardships as Ishan's father-- the family's breadwinner,  just flew over to the US (on August 4th) to provide Ishan additional long-term support, leaving his business on hold. Ishan's health insurance covers his medical expenses. However, living expenses for him and his father,  immigration costs for his father's continued stay until his recovery, and many other expenses during his time of recovery are the areas of financial worry. Upon speaking with people in prior similar situations, we anticipate a significant financial burden on Ishan and his family, in addition to the physical, emotional and psychological challenges. We are friends of Ishan and we are setting up this fundraiser requesting any financial support that you can afford, with the aim to lessen the financial burden from his family. Thank you very much in advance for your generous support!P.s. We plan on being fully transparent about all the incoming funds and incurred medical expenses, as endorsed by Sewa International volunteers.

But our sweet 10 year old will have a journey ahead of him.  He will have to endure chemo for three months which includes 10+ day stays in the hospital for each round. B cell lymphoma can be difficult to diagnose and also likes to spread so although we are grateful that his survival rate is near 100%, Nate has already started the hard work of receiving chemo through a port in his chest and also through his spine with several spinal taps to ensure there is no spread of disease. Not only does he have a long road ahead of him, this will also take him away from his home and his twin brothers Derek and Kyle, incoming 4th graders, for the summer. Nate loves summer and everything that goes along with it, some of his favorites things to do are play golf, fish and swim. However his treatments will take him away from these activities this summer, along with missing the time with his brothers.  Nate is also a boy with special needs which makes his treatment more difficult as it is hard for him to understand the things he's being asked, both physically and emotionally and also hard for him to explain all the feelings he is having.Nate’s FamilyIf you know his parents, Eric and Jenna, you know they don't ask anyone for much help. These past several weeks have been very hard on them trying to manage a household and three boys while one is in the hospital. Eric is self-employed and has put his work load aside to be with Nate.  Jenna works at a preschool and may not be able to go back to work in the fall as Nate cannot get sick because of a compromised immune system. Nate’s amazing parents have not left his side and will continue to be with him on this journey.  As medical bills come in and other things arise (i.e., babysitters, last minute care for the twins, cancelled summer vacations, etc.) this gofundme has been set up for Nate's care and anything that he could potentially need now and in the future as he battles to make cancer a memory! If you can donate, great! If you cannot please #prayforNate!Faith, Family, FriendsWe are so very thankful for the wonderful village of family and friends that Nate has surrounding him to help make this unfortunate time easier to deal with. Receiving care at Maria Fareri Children's Hospital in Valhalla means that the family is close to home and can be surrounded by their tribe at this difficult time. Meals, laundry, carting the twins to camp and offers to hang with us and Nate have been overwhelming. We truly believe in the power of prayer and ask that you continue to #prayforNate as time goes on and his family can adjust to this new normal. We know that God has a plan for us and any funds not needed for Nate will find their way to other kids fighting cancer battles all over.",368,993,26,369,1 month,16 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Their son Winston, 21 months, a rough n’ tumble, joyful toddler with an infectious laugh and a giving nature for a kid so young, was diagnosed with a kidney cancer called Wilms Tumor. A malignant growth the size of a baseball covered his right kidney. Two days later, Winston underwent a nephrectomy (the removal of the kidney) in the hopes that the tumor was encapsulated and that all of the cancer would be eradicated.Heartbreakingly, Winston’s team discovered that Winston’s cancer is Stage 3, having spread to his lymph nodes. He is now undergoing a rigorous six-month course of chemotherapy and radiation. To make matters way worse,  Brian’s employer National Grid locked out all of their workers and stopped paying the company portion of their health insurance even after his union offered to continue working with the old contract until their new contract was negotiated.(You might have seen the interview Brian did about the situation in the video above, which was also covered in a segment by WCVB here in Boston.)There are so many unknowns both emotionally and financially when it comes to cancer treatment and disease management. The Harveys are the kind of couple who’ve both been working hard since they were teenagers. They’re the type of people who go above and beyond when their family and friends are in need.  So I started this GoFundMe to help them in their time of need with Winston’s medical costs during treatment. Winston has been given excellent chances for a full recovery by his oncology team. So, if you’re reading this, please give what you can to reach our goal in helping him return to staging toy dinosaur battles on his daddy’s head and gleefully fist-bumping with everyone in the room.  And if you can’t, positive thoughts or a prayer or two are more than welcome.

Kevin struggles with simple tasks we all take for granted.    Kevin has been a dedicated FDNY firefighter for 15 years.

As he had just turned five, his yearly check up was a few days away. Sophy and Michael brought their concerns to the primary care doctor. The doctor wasn't too concerned and sent them on their way to an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist felt it was a virus that may have effected the cranial nerve. To err on the side of caution the ophthalmologist sent Ori for an MRI to rule out anything else. Ori's MRI was on Monday July 24th and on Tuesday the 25th the Singer's lives took a turn that is a families worst nightmare. As Sophy and Michael sat down with the neuro-oncologyst and various other doctors they learned that Ori has a tumor in his brain stem. The doctors refer to this as pediatric glioma in the brain stem. If you don't already know, the brain stem controls almost everything: swallowing, seeing, breathing, and beyond. Ori's tumor is in his brain stem and is inoperable. Immediately Sophy and Michael were on the phone with multiple doctors, friends and family members to determine next steps. They were able to schedule a biopsy for one week later and an additional MRI. On Tuesday July 31st Ori was put under general anesthesia and underwent a biopsy where a robot went through his nose and into his brain-stem. The surgeon was able to get what he needed. With the biopsy has come many set backs for Ori and the Singer family. Due to edema from the procedure and the sensitivity of the brain stem Ori has since been unable to swallow, is slurring his speech, and is having a hard time smiling and using the muscles in his mouth. In addition he is having some respiratory set backs with his oxygen levels and coughing throughout his day. As of last night, Wednesday, Ori was moved from the ICU to another room. The neuro-oncologist shared that Ori would need time and rehab to strengthen the muscles that support his speech and swallowing. Lastly he received an NG tube which goes through his nose and delivers food into his stomach. The goal is to fill Ori with nutrients as he is re-learning to swallow. Within the next 2 weeks the Singer family will learn the results of the biopsy and a treatment plan will be determined. There has been such beautiful outpouring of love and support from friends, family and the community and the Singer family is very grateful. The purpose of this Gofundme page is to raise enough money so that Sophy can take 1-2 months off from work to focus on Ori's next steps while also caring for Sasha, Ori's twin sister.  Sasha has visited Ori in the hospital. At this time she knows that Ori has a boo boo on his brain and he has a special tube in his nose to help him eat while he is learning to swallow again. Its hard to believe how quickly one's life can change. Please consider contributing to the Singer family.With so much love, gratitude and sincere appreciation.Kim, Carlsbad CA",470,1.3k,7,472,1 month,21 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

For the last eight years, the Gooleys have spent much of their time in emergency rooms and doctor’s offices, searching for answers and praying for healing. As doctors began to manage the initial diagnosis, another came: Vasculitis in the form Bechet's Syndrome . On top of his diagnoses, he’s battled recurring pneumonia, sepsis and had two heart attacks. And the last nine months have been the hardest of all. Tim missed his brother’s funeral, his eldest son’s wedding, a son’s law school graduation and a family trip to California. He received a third diagnosis, mycobacterium (MAC), broke his right hip and was left bedridden after an emergency knee replacement four weeks ago.On April 15, 2018 after a severe vasculitis flare left him hospitalized and delirious from the pain, Tim was airlifted to the Cleveland Clinic to give specialists another shot at treating him.Throughout this journey, family members, the community and their church stepped up, offering prayers and everyday support, as Joni split her time between caring for Tim, raising the three youngest children and working full time as the guidance counselor at Lake Park Elementary.

A little bit about Ezana: Ezana Goitom is 45-years old, the son of Neguest Menguesha and Goitom Gide, youngest brother of Ephrem, Issayas, Zebad, Aster and Azeb Goitom.  Like all his siblings, Ezana went to Lycée Gebremariam French School in Addis Ababa, before emigrating to the US in early 90's.His medical condition:Our brother Ezana Goitom Gide sustained a spinal cord injury and has been diagnosed with Central Cord Syndrome.  He is now quadriplegic, bed bound, unable to move his extremities.  Ezana is oxygen dependent with a tracheostomy to breath.  He has a speaking valve that allows him to speak.For the past seven  months, he has been to different hospitals due to many health complications and problems.   After many ups and downs, two steps forward one step back, he is currently preparing for an acute rehabilitation.Based on the overall assessment of the Doctors, we are realistic in recognizing that he will not regain his motor skills and now, we are gearing towards planning his future accordingly.This is where we are making this humble appeal to our family and friends for help.  The road is long and we are turning for your help to alleviate some of the financial burden we are facing. This experience has made us all reflect in the preciousness of life.   We are constantly reminded to do our due diligence by Ezana’slove, smile, sense of humor, his courage in his acceptance of his condition and yet with optimism in a future where he sees himself being productive and independent.  Ezana says the outpouring of love and support received during these past seven months from family and friends inspires him to endure with hope and sanity, as we, in turn, are inspired by his attitude to do all we can to help him.   His medical condition should not be an impediment to living life to its fullest and to being productive – the mind is too precious not to fight for.We would like to thank all our friends and family members who have been with us during this difficult time and words fail us to express how grateful we are for the love and support you’ve shown us.  May God reward you a thousand fold! Zebad, Ephrem, Ezana , Azeb and Aster in Neuro-ICUWhere your money goes: Ezana needs  an acute rehabilitation.  In order to be admitted to a rehabilitation center, he will need a discharge plan to a safe living space for his condition.  This means that he has to have a place in Washington, D.C., which is approved by the American Disability Act.  We are currently looking for suitable apartments close to the rehabilitation center until we find one through government help in the long term.Although he may be eligible to receive 12 to 18 hours of home aide per day, his current medical status requires 24 hours skilled nursing care per day for which he will need to pay out of pocket.In addition, the equipment needed to alleviate his situation is costly.   Since he is unable to use his limbs, he will need a computer to be operated with his eyes/voice and a motorized wheelchair to be monitored with his head. Also, in order for us, the family, to move him around from home to an out patient acute rehabilitation, we will need a handicapped friendly van. It is a humbling experience to ask for funds, however life is too sacred not to fight for it.Please stand with us and help us know we’re not alone. Again, thank you so much for all that you’ve done for us.   It is in the support that we’ve received thus far that we found the courage to make this appeal.Ezana with his mother",399,3.0k,3,397,3 months,1 day ago,-1,2018-09-03

This is a rallying cry to musicians, people in the music industry and music-lovers, Mark needs your help to beat cancer!Mark was diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma cancer in May 2017. A small mole on his shoulder began to change. It was removed and showed to be cancer. It grew back very aggressively and had already spread to his liver and spleen.He flew to Canada to begin treatment but his body kept rejecting the medicine and he became sicker and sicker.The cancer then spread to his lungs. He came back to Los Angeles in December to begin a cutting-edge cancer treatment trial at the Beverly Hills Cancer Clinic.It was then discovered that the cancer had spread to his brain. He immediately began 2 weeks of brain radiation. The results of the radiation are being monitored now to see how successful it has been.He is receiving long-term treatment to try to arrest the growth of the cancer and stop it from spreading further.The treatment is immunotherapy, radiation and T-Vec. Now his insurance company in the US has stopped approving his T-Vec injections. They’re also taking weeks/months to approve immunotherapy treatment, scans and basic care that is imperative to Mark’s recovery. It’s dangerous because Mark has Stage 4 Melanoma and it is a highly aggressive form which has shown to spread and metastasize very rapidly. He has flown back to Canada to try to get the medication and treatment that he needs with cancer specialist, Marcus Butler at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, who is one of the leading Melanoma specialists in North America. He needs to be in a little apartment in Toronto where he can be close to his doctors and the cancer clinic. We need to raise enough money to pay his rent, bills and living expenses for a year or two. This will give him the time to finish treatment and regain his health and beat this.He has been unable to work since he was diagnosed and has no form of income. We need Mark Howard in the world, not only because he is an amazing father and friend but for the music he is yet to give us… Put on “Time Out Of Mind,” “World Without Tears,” “Wrecking Ball” and think of Mark and then donate.

I have had several scary moments that made me fight for my life, have gone through a surgery that landed me in the ICU, and have endured numerous medical complications. However, I have been blessed with much support and love by my husband, family and friends which has helped me stay positive and motivated. Due to this, I have been able to complete my doctorate in the mist of all this and I have been able to maintain my employment in which I have  dedicated my life to. Unfortunately, this in itself has brought me many negative consequences due to my weak immune system (chronic nausea, fatigue, hospitalizations, multiple ER visits, etc.) which makes working at times very difficult. As a result I have had to reduce my hours. The Lord has blessed me with the best team of doctors (Dr. Pinelli, Dr. Katz and Dr. Diaz) and if it was not from this team, I would not be here writing this today. As my treatment has continued forth, it has reached a point where my treatment team is recommending the need for additional treatment. After undergoing the 5th regimen of chemo, I have begun seeking out consults from multiple major universities and hospitals throughout the state.  After no additional clinical trials or treatment options have been found here in Florida, the search has begun to be explored outside the state. The Lord has opened a door in Houston, Texas at MD Anderson. I was contacted last week and was told I was a candidate for a study that would be held during the summer and am also eligible for additional treatment options that Florida does not currently have. This of course is an answer to my prayer and a move that is highly recommended from my treatment team. However, with this comes much expense due to the need to having to stay in Houston for the duration of my treatment. Unfortunately this decision has placed me in a very big hardship and in need of additional funding so I can heal. Please pass this on to anyone who knows me or is sympathetic to my cause. Prayers are additionally recommended.",137,319,0,135,5 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Oncologists at Sloan Kettering are aiming to shrink the tumor enough to operate, since it currently touches one artery and is wrapping around another artery. They may also administer another round of chemo and/or radiation following the surgery. As anyone who knows Margo would expect, she is facing this diagnosis with her characteristic tenacity, pragmatism and bravery.  In late June, she said goodbye to her coworkers at Caliper Studios in Bushwick, a job she loves, in order to focus on treatment and healing. John, her husband, and their two kids, Declan (14) and Severine (11) and their dog Lucy, will be by her side in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The coming months are not going to be easy, but the support of friends and family will make all the difference. We are asking you to be as generous as you can in Margo’s time of need.All money will go directly to Margo and her family. Funds will help offset her loss of income, medical expenses not covered by insurance, and the many other outlays of money necessary to provide comfort to her as she fights cancer and recovers from this overwhelming ordeal.No donation is too small, and anything you can contribute will make a difference. She and her family are already very grateful for the support they’ve received in the wake of this diagnosis. Margo has started a blog on CaringBridge.com. You can read it here:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/margogibsonWe will also have a fundraising event for Margo after her surgery in the fall, where some of her favorite local bands and DJs will perform.

We are unsure if a portion of his paralysis is temporary, or if this will be a permanent reality for him, but for now, Jeff will live life as a paraplegic.We’ve had so many people reach out to us, so we’ve created this GoFundMe for those who want to help.One of the biggest hurdles Jeff and his family will face moving forward is the struggle of regaining the quality of life they once had.

The expenses are sure to stack up quickly; current and future medical bills, wheelchairs, wheelchair ramps, widening doors, modifying bathrooms/kitchens, wheelchair lifts for stairs, a new car that can accommodate a disabled driver are all priorities, but they only represent a portion of the financial burden his family will be bearing during his recovery.Please, be generous.

Allen is facing a very uncertain future.  Christy has many tests scheduled and is unable to care for herself.  Allen has medical insurance, but every home visit his insurance will allow comes with a co-pay.  That could be $75/per day alone.  Additionally, if he has to take leave without pay, he will have to pay part, and very soon all, all of his medical premiums at almost $1,000/month.  Allen did not want to ask for help, but his brother-in-law who is also a deputy reached out to us at their Association and asked for help.  We are trying to coordinate a donation of hours, but our county requires employees to jump through almost insurmountable hoops to get there.  Therefore, we need to reach out and ask for any assistance you can give.  The family is under a tremendous amount of stress coupled with the unknown as Christy continues to rapidly deteriorate with no diagnosis.    Every penny donated will go directly to Allen to help defray any costs and pay the bills.  He is tremendously worried about feeding his children over the coming months and we ask you to help relieve some of that stress so that he can focus on taking care of his wife and children.  Thank you very much!Below is what I asked Allen to write up for this campaign.  I am so touched by their love story and hope that you are also.  From Allen:  Christy and I met when she moved in across the street from me.  I was 17 and she was 16 at the time in 1988.  We started dating and dated for six years before deciding to marry in 1994.  We had our first child Bradley in 2003, Second child Tyler 2006, and third child Ian 2010.  We purchased our first house in 1998 and are still there to this date.  Our son Bradley started having medical issues around 2014 which created numerous trips to several different doctors, time off work, and extra medical expenses.  Bradley was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus almost a year later.  In July 2017, we started to notice Christy having difficulty performing routine daily tasks.  Christy started seeing doctors about her condition in July 2017 and was then sent to the specialists at USC for further evaluation.  It has been determined Christy has a brain disorder that has yet to be diagnosed.  At this point in time Christy cannot walk without assistance, care for our three boys, and cannot be left alone due to her high fall risk.  I have depleted my vacation / comp banks to tend to the needs of my wife and son and expect there to be large medical bills soon.  Any money donated will be used only for medical and household necessities.",414,1.2k,3,416,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

As many of you know Ann Marie has received quite a tough diagnosis and needs our help. On June 18, on her birthday no less, she was given a diagnosis of a rare aggressive throat cancer.Because of the severity and aggressiveness of the cancer, laryngectomy surgery is scheduled next week (July 3, 2018) at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. In order to get all of the cancer, they will completely remove her larynx (voice box), and lymphnodes; she will loose her ability to speak. She will need to learn how to breathe, talk and eat in a new way. Post surgery she will be in the ICU for 48 hours and then will remain in the hospital for 7 - 10 days. She won’t be able to eat through her mouth and will use a feeding tube until while her throat heals. She will learn to use a temporary device to communicate (Electrolarynx) in a new way and begin the long process of recovery. Once discharged from the hospital she will require homecare support and nursing to help with the healing process. She will be home 4-6 weeks attending to the care of her stoma, other medical issues and medical appointments. Once the site has healed a Voice Prosthesis (TE- Tracheoesophageal) will be placed at that time which is the gold standard in voice restoration. At that time she will learn esophageal speech. When recommended by her Dr’s, she will receive 35 days of Radiation along with a combination of Chemotherapy.  She needs our help with funding: ·       Purchasing and maintenance of laryngectomy equipment which is not covered by insurance -remember this is for the rest of her life. ·       Purchasing ongoing Voice Assistive technology speaking equipment so she can communicate with health care workers, family, friends, colleagues, clients and patients. Her goal is to return to her private practice when she is strong enough. ·        She will need extensive speech rehabilitation, medication and additional therapies to help her stay strong. All of these services will be capped by insurance and will require out of pocket monies to cover. Again, this is for the rest of her life. ·       Home services not covered by insurance for ongoing care (Private Nursing, Speech, etc.)·       Deductibles from insurance·       Loss of income – which covers her health insurance, medical expenses, and ongoing home expenses, and private practice expenses.  Any monies not used in this process will be donated to Dana Faber Cancer Institute for helping larynjectomy patients.  It breaks my heart that Ann Marie will have to go through this.  For those of us who have had the pleasure to work with her, we know what a caring and talented woman she is. Her generosity of spirit, combined with her expertise and wisdom are a rare gift - she is a rare find! As a colleague, she has a wealth of experience to draw upon that has enhanced my knowledge.

It was a Monday and like most Monday’s Brianna didn’t want to get up and go to school. Even 8-year-olds can have a case of the Monday’s now and then, or so my sister had hoped. This Monday turned out to be very different. It was life-altering, heart-stopping, and heartbreaking.My sister is a critical care RN and has had a gut-wrenching feeling for years (6 to be exact) that something was medically going on with Brianna. She, like any good parent, took her daughter Brianna to doctor after doctor looking for answers. She went to a total of 27 specialists over 6 years, each one explaining away Brianna’s weird symptoms and unexplained weight gain. My sister kept thinking all along that Brianna may have a tumor in her pituitary gland and asked for CT scans and MRI's from many physicians over the years. All of the doctors just said the same thing, ""she is just overweight"" blaming her symptoms on her weight. Refusing to do CT scan because “we don’t like to expose children to that much radiation” or ""the insurance is never going to approve an MRI"". All of the doctors were telling her that her daughter's raspy voice, paralysis of the vocal cord, swelling of her head, dizzy spells with nausea were just symptoms of weight gain. Finally, on April 9, 2018, Brianna had another rough morning of dizzy spells and couldn’t get up. My sister took her back to the ER who again, blamed her weight. They told my sister that her dizzy spells were because she is an anxious child, she needs to lose weight and to see a psychologist. My sister refused to leave the ER without a CT scan. Our worst possible nightmare was now a reality. Brianna, in fact, does have a brain tumor.... and because so many years had passed and so many health care providers let my family down, the tumor has had years to grow and spread into her spinal cord. These same doctors, including the ER doctor that day, are calling my family almost daily to tell them how sorry they are and to check on Brianna. We are not trying to put down the health care system, Brianna’s mom is an RN. We want all parents out there to know that frequent hiccups, hoarse voice, body odor at a young age, and dizzy spells are some of her symptoms that are definitely directly related to her tumor. Please do not simply pass them off as no big deal. Brianna is in for the fight of her life and needs her parents and brother to be with her as much as possible. Her mother and father both had to stop working in order to take her to Memphis, TN to Bonheur Children’s Hospital for tumor resection. Here was her best chance to get as much of the tumor out based on size/location and the fact that it spread. Her first 15-hour surgery on April 16, 2018, had complications of blood clots throughout her brain. Then on April 27, 2018, she had to go back to surgery because of fever, leaking of Cerebral Spinal Fluid and intense pain. She now has a brain drain (EVD) and may need a ventricular shunt in the coming weeks. Both her parents were everyday hardworking people, an RN and Journeymen Linemen, just getting by day to day and trying to do the best for their family. Now they both need to be with Brianna as she is extremely ill and as any 8-year-old would need, she needs her parents by her side. So, if you are able to help them in a monetary way in their desperate and darkest time of need, then Thank You from the bottom of our hearts. If you are unable to help monetarily, then please lift up our family in prayer because we need all the thoughts, prayers and love we can get for our family at this time.

He was diagnosed in June of 2014 with Stage 4 brain cancer and given 14 months to live. He's been valiantly fighting it ever since and has obviously outlived the expectations.  For a while, we all thought he might have beaten it, but then recently it re-emerged. On May 31st, 2018, they removed a plum sized tumor from his brain. The doctors have given him less than a year to live.  The best estimate is 3-8 months. He's maxed out on radiation and chemo is not promising - it might extend his life a bit but does not appear to be a viable solution. He's working hard at a holistic approach, but the situation is dire. I'm a friend of the family and I'm raising money for him: both for the future of his family and to help them pack some joyful living into the time he has left. He has a short window of health left. This money will help defray hidden medical expenses not covered by insurance AND help Josh and his family to do some things together as a family before the cancer takes it toll. Josh's employer, The South Bend Fire Department, has been exceptionally good to him.

After meeting with the oncologists at both Dana and Dartmouth his first form of defense is going to be chemo therapy.  He needs to attack the whole body, not just one concentrated area.  What kind of chemo treatment he will receive is still being determined. Seth is currently working with oncologists at both at Dana Farber and Dartmouth Hitchcock.  With as many experts' minds pooled together, they are going to coordinate and hopefully develop the best treatment plan possible for him.  Chemo will just be the first of many to come!Due to the extreme amount of pain he has been in he has not been able to work.  Once he started receiving medications (which he is still finding the right combination to work for him) he could not return to his place of employment while taking these medications.  He is considered not ""fit for duty"" as they call it in the Nuclear Power Plant world.  So he's had to step down or resign at this point from his job.  With no steady income at the moment and a number of expenses coming in, we are asking for the help of our family and friends.  We can't ease his physical or emotional pains,  but our hope is to relieve some of the financial burdens of this illness.  His focus needs to be on getting himself better and taking care of his adorable three year old son Carter.

We are in such a state of shock. We don’t even know how to fully process this. While on his way home early in the morning, Nate’s car skidded on ice, crashed, and ejected him head first through the windshield.Nate was in the snow for five hours, and his body temperature dropped to 81 degrees before the emergency workers were able to find him. He was life-flighted almost immediately to a hospital in Sioux Falls, where our family rushed to be with him. He has swelling in the brain, but no bleeding as of now. He has broken bones in the lower region of his back, and severely bad road rash across his back. The doctors decided to put Nate in a medically induced coma and hook him up to a ventilator in order to reduce the brain’s swelling and body’s trauma. He is still unable to gain full consciousness as of now, and hasn’t opened his eyes yet, but we are patient for his recovery. Thanks be to God there is hope. Nate’s hands, feet, eyes, and brain are all responsive and moving. His doctors are stunned that he is even alive, but we know how big our God is and what great miracles He gives to us. Now though, we are forced to play an excruciating waiting game while Nate’s body works to heal. We are plagued by doubts and fears, and almost consumed with an anxiousness that ranges from a numbing worry to all-out panic.  We say almost because, although this event is one of the worst kinds of pain for a family, while there is life there is hope. We are surrounded by an unbelievable support system that is praying for us minute by minute. We are so incredibly blessed by all of you, and will be thankful for everyone’s thoughts, prayers, and love forever.Our next step is to make a plan to get Nate home when he wakes up. This means flying him from South Dakota to California while trying to keep him with all the necessary medical care. Our family needs $30,000 to do this. If anyone feels like they are able to donate, even just $5, we would be forever grateful. And if not, we ask from the deepest part of our hearts to please send up a few prayers for Nate, that he would be able to wake up soon. Again, We are so thankful for every one of you, for even taking the time out of your day to read this post. Believe me, your prayers and love are felt every second of the day. We wish all the happiness to you and yours, and hopefully will be able to send a miracle update any hour now.

He has flown with jetBlue for over 14 years. He had opportunities to advance to captain, but he decided to wait for our daughter to finish high school before we relocated.  Craig was instrumental in being a role model to our daughter Rylee, who is currently a student in the Aviation program at Utah Valley University following in his footsteps.   Hurricane Irma welcomed us to Fort Lauderdale when we relocated in September 2017. We took an emergency flight out to Puerto Rico between the two storms. We are so grateful for jetBlue’s compassion and generosity of capping all flights at $99 during that desperate time. Every work flight, I look forward to my love Craig returning home safely. On his last return flight home, the day before father’s day, Craig told me that he had pains in his stomach. When he arrived home, his eyes looked a little yellow.  In the morning, they were bright yellow and his skin was orangish yellow.  On our way to the beach, we made a quick stop at instacare, and surprisingly we were rerouted to the ER.  He was there for 6 days and they found a cancerous tumor in his upper GI tract.  Whipple surgery was scheduled for July 16 to remove the tumor. The surgeons felt this intense surgery would be effective and that his cancer was curable because it was so small. During the three week wait for the surgery, Craig had the most positive, strongest attitude that he would beat this. We enjoyed being together each day, working out, walking on the beach, snorkeling and kayaking to keep his mind off the upcoming surgery.    July 16, 2018 had dual meaning for our family. Our daughter, Rylee, was getting her multi-engine certification and Craig was having major whipple surgery.  At the same time, Rylee was in the air, successfully taking her skills test, and Craig was in a long 8 hour intense surgery. In Craig’s critical surgery parts  of his intestinal tract, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, and the gallbladder were removed.  After surgery, he was not sent to the ICU to be carefully monitored. After 4 short days and still spitting up black bile the hospital still released him to go home. Less than 24 hours later, he became violently ill. I called 911 because he was non responsive and his skin was gray. They rushed him to ER where he aspirated feces bile into his lungs. His heartbeat flatlined. They revived him and put him on  a ventilator - oxygen life support. He has been in critical care ICU for 5 weeks. His perfectly healthy lungs were destroyed, before his body even had time to heal from the surgery. Several chest tubes are in his lungs to drain the excessive fluid. The doctors informed me he needs a lung transplant. The hospital has been contacting hospitals all over the country.  Craig is not qualified as a recipient because his cancer needs to be in remission for 5 years before they would accept him as a transplant recipient. We are searching for other options.  After several brain and body scans, all other organs are fully functioning.  He is fully conscious and aware. He has a strong heart, mind, and soul.  He is loving, kind, young, physically fit and positive.  He is a true friend to everyone!   Currently, I, along with family and friends, are praying for his every breath, literally.  Everyday my time is spent with him. I am reaching out to others, who want to show their love and support for Craig Hellmers needs.   Much Love Tricia  Craig Hellmers, I love you more, we are going to grow old together.",431,589,4,440,12 days,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Eric has been struggling with chronic Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections for the past ten years.Lyme disease is no joke. Symptoms include severe fatigue, brain fog, neurological and arthritic pain, insomnia, and depression. Blood labs and testing regularly fail to reveal the disease; therefore, doctors end up simply treating symptoms. The longer it goes misdiagnosed, the more difficult it becomes to treat.Eric has been able to work through the discomfort of this debilitating disease until recently. If you know him even a little bit, you know how much he likes to work! Treatment for advanced Lyme is quite expensive and the majority is not covered by his health insurance. Sadly, the Office of Workers Compensation Program (OWCP) is a cumbersome, contentious, and unresolving system that leaves many wildland firefighters with overwhelming medical bills to cover.Erics wife Celine has been elected as the sole beneficiary for funds gathered during the campaign.

There is currently no cure for this dreadful disease, and the standard treatment is radiotherapy simply to extend the child's life. You can read more about DIPG here Over the last 8 weeks, Georgia has undergone 4 MRI's, a brain biopsy and 6 weeks of radiotherapy. At this time, this is all that conventional medicine can do for us. However, there ARE therapies out there. They're experimental in nature, but we've researched them endlessly and identified the ones that show promise. We feel very strongly that we owe it to our little girl to try them. Her quality of life is forefront of our mind, so we won't put her through endless treatments if she is clearly deteriorating. But right now, she's improving, and has such a will to live and a love of life, that we are determined to try and save her. Without trying these treatments, she has just months to live. The first, and perhaps most costly procedure, is she is being fitted with a Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) system. This is a relatively new technique which allows cancer fighting drugs to pass across the 'Blood Brain Barrier', the impenetrable wall that makes treating brain stem cancer so difficult. You can read more about CED here  This procedure is estimated to cost around £60,000.Once fitted, Georgia can receive transfusions of the chemotherapy drugs that show some promise, as well as using immunotherapy treatments to fight the cancer. These infusions will involve travelling every few weeks to Europe, and are estimated to cost between £6,000 and £20,000 per infusion. Our total estimated costs are in the region of £200,000 to £300,000 and are all Out of Pocket. We are draining our savings to fund as much as we can, but still have a shortfall.

At the time of this diagnosis, Katie was a mom, a wife, a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a niece, a cousin, a friend, a teacher, an active runner and a traveler.  Katie’s daughter, Áine, was 15 months old.  Shortly after Áine’s birth, Katie started to notice some difficulty with her balance, her memory and word retrieval.  She thought these symptoms were postpartum related or stress after going back to work with a baby.     Fortunately, her primary care doctor listened to her concerns and ordered blood tests and an MRI.  Two days later Katie was told she had pernicious anemia, which is serious low vitamin B levels and often has similar symptoms to MS. This was a big relief for someone who thought she might have brain cancer! Her primary doctor encouraged her to go ahead with the MRI scheduled for 2 days later.  As soon as the radiologist read the report, Katie was sent to the emergency room and was admitted to the MGH neurology floor.       After several more tests, including a lumbar puncture and consultation with many doctors Katie was told the MRI results showed 70 – 90 active liaisons on her brain and her spine.  She had Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS).  RRMS is consider the best form of MS (if there is such a thing) and many people who have RRMS live full and happy lives.  RRMS is a chronic, disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and the body.       That weekend Katie started to imagine her brain full of crawling snakes like Medusa!     After 4 days of treatment with steroids, Katie went home believing that she would be back to her students the next week.  Her family and doctors kept suggesting she needed more time to allow her brain to recover.     Six weeks later I was with Katie when I noticed her acting strangely and she admitted that she was seeing double.  The ride from Weymouth to MGH was stressful as Katie saw 2 cars instead of 1 and 2 people when I only saw 1!   At the hospital Katie saw disjointed body parts of people walking the hallways.  How do you explain this without sounding crazy?  She was admitted for observation and the new MRI showed more MS activity.  We were in a nice room with a great view of the moon on the Charles River. Katie asked us why the moon was moving, kind of dancing around. We looked at each other with concern and explained that the moon was not moving, it was just hanging in the sky.     Katie is a fighter, she did not give up and she ran a 5K road race the next week with a friend.     At this point, she realized she was not going back to work for a long time.  This was a tough realization.  With this relapse we all realized that this disease was much worse than we originally thought and her doctors told her she had a much more aggressive form of RRMS than they originally thought. This relapse meant Katie was not able to work, take care of her daughter, run by herself, sing the alphabet song, read a book, drive or get out of bed on some days.  She had severe headaches from her forehead to her tailbone.     The doctors started Katie on a new drug, Tysabri.  Tysabri is administered intravenously every 4 weeks at the hospital. This drug seemed to prevent flare ups for a time being, however, the fatigue and pain has never gone away.     In October of 2016, about 7 months after her diagnosis, in pouring rain, Katie and her friend, Kara, ran the BAA ½ marathon and finished without stopping. They promised each other they would not cry along the way.  I was on the side lines with my sister and we cried! When they finished, Katie and Kara allowed themselves to cry.     Katie stayed hopeful and with the help of family and friends who drove her to and from work, prepared meals and looked after Áine, she was able to return to work full time in February of 2017, 1 year after her diagnosis.  She was happy to be working again, but it was exhausting.  Every day when she went home from work, she gave Áine as much attention as she could and went to bed crying, before sun had set. She finished the school year and with the help of her principal, she was able to secure a 3 day a week position for the fall of 2017.      Last month Katie was excited to spend a rare Saturday evening out with friends, playing bingo at the church all.  She sat down and even before taking a sip of a drink, she knew that something was happening in her brain. Two friends helped her out to the car and they drove her to my house because it was closest. One look at her and I knew we had to go the MGH immediately! This was another scary ride to through Boston because Katie could not hold a bottle of water in her hands, she was shaking all over and her jaw started to droop. At the hospital, they originally thought she was having a stroke or a brain aneurysm and she got plenty of attention.  These were quickly ruled out we breathed a sigh of relief, but it was MS. She was admitted again, was given high doses of steroids, was released the next day and missed 1 week of work.  Since this relapse, the fatigue is worse, her memory is worse, her word retrieval is worse and her debilitating headaches are worse.       We decided to look for other treatments. The only treatment shown in clinical trials to be effective at halting the progression of RRMS is hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In addition to halting MS progression, some patients experience reversal of symptoms. This treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy to wipe out the immune system, and then the patient’s own bone marrow stem cells are transplanted back in the body to help rebuild an immune system with no memory of MS. Without HSCT, there is a 100% probability that Katie’s RRMS will continue to progress. At this point, this is the best option to halt the progression of this disease and maybe erase some of the systems. This is not a cure, but it is hope.        Since HSCT is very limited in the States, Katie and I will travel to Mexico so that she can receive HSCT.  Insurance will not cover the cost of the procedure. We are seeking donations to offset the cost of HSCT and follow-up care, which is approximately $60,000.      Katie wants to have this procedure because she is tried of living a half a live.  She beats herself up because she worries that she is not a good enough mother.  In her words, “Áine deserves better.”  Doctors consider Katie “stable” but she goes to work every day with debilitating headaches and exhaustion.        We are grateful for the wonderful care Katie has received at MGH, for our large, loving family and a great community of friends.  We will be holding a fundraiser sometime early this summer.  We hope you will join us or consider donating thru this site.       Fear has two meanings: Forget Everything and Run or Face Everything and Rise!  Katie has chosen to Rise!",226,373,4,256,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Andrew and Giana hardly ever left his side and brought him home a healthy, albeit small, baby boy. Since then, Henry has grown to be a big boy, full of life and always ready to play and have fun.

At this point, we don't yet know the severity of the cancer. Tomorrow Henry will undergo surgery where a port will be inserted in order to push chemotherapy and other drugs. He'll have bone marrow pulled to determine the type of Cancer. He'll also have a spinal tap to determine if the Cancer has spread to his spinal cord. His stay in the Hospital could be limited to 10 days, or as long as 4 months. We just don't know yet.

Landon has been diagnosed with Stage IV Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer there is, in his frontal lobe. Landon is only 39 years old. After experiencing severe headaches and slight personality changes, Landon received a brain scan on February 28, 2018. The MRI revealed a massive tumor in the 7 cm range (the size of an orange). With no time to waste, he and his family packed their bags and immediately flew to the island of O'ahu to undergo surgery to remove the brain tumor.Surgery went well, with 98-100% of the tumor successfully removed! Landon did experience several strokes during surgery, resulting in some of the deeper parts of his brain dying. However, their beloved surgeon, Dr. Kumar, believes that other parts of his brain can compensate for that and expects Landon to be able to make a full recovery (in terms of brain damage).  Now, Landon requires extensive treatment. Dr. Kumar recommends the ""gold standard"" of treatment, which includes both chemotherapy and radiation. Another treatment option would be Optune; a wearable device and fairly new & successful method. After the ""gold standard"" treatment, it is suggested to pursue a clinical trial for immunotherapy at one of the nations leading cancer facilities.  In conjunction with the conventional treatments, the Johnson family will be attacking the cancer from many other angles, including; nutrition (keto diet- to starve any remaining cells from their glucose food source), exercise, stress reduction, supplements, medical marijuana, infrared sauna, and so much more. The average survival time with Glioblastoma (grade 4) with regular treatment is 12-18 months - only 20% of glioblastoma patients survive more than one year, and only 3% of patients survive more than three years. With the radical treatments, clinical trials, and age on our side, his chances can be greatly increased- with a 20% chance of surviving 5+ years. In some cases, patients can live up to 20+ years!! With that said- the Johnson famliy NEEDS funds to be able to pursue radical treatments and give Landon his best chance at living a long, fulfilling life.Landon has touched and continues to impact the lives of countless people: as a social worker, small business owner, son, husband, and now father. He lives on the island of Maui and loves to surf, travel, be in the ocean, and of course, spend time with his new son & beautiful wife. We humbly request assistance in restoring hope for the Johnson family. Your contribution will help cover the astronomical costs of treatment, travel costs, loss of income, rehabilitation, and quality of life for the Johnson famliy during this unimaginably difficult time.",344,1.1k,18,342,5 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Among many things, SJS attacks the mucus membranes and left his lungs severely damaged. He went from being a successful multisport athlete and student, to one that struggled aerobically on the field. Not willing to quit, he trained to become a Goal Keeper hoping he could reduce the cardiovascular demands on his body and hoping he could continue to play the game he loved. Dylan adjusted to his new base line of 50% lung capacity and still competed at some of the highest club and high school soccer levels. His teammates will remember him as the player who finished the runs long after the rest of the team, but he always finished. His determination and commitment to everything he did was admirable. Over the past 4 years his lungs declined further from a MRSSA infection and then Pneumonia. At 18%, he had to make the hardest call of his life to the college coach he had committed to play soccer for in Minnesota; his primary concern was not himself, but for the teammates that he knew would depend on him. Evaluation began in September 2017 at University of Washington Medical Center for potential Bilateral Lung Transplant. On Saturday, July 14th Dylan received the incredible gift of new Lungs from a donor, something he can only repay by making the same commitment to life he always has.

My husband’s name is Stephen Boulanger and he has been struggling with brain cancer since November 2008. If any of you know Steve personally then you would know what a fun, amazing person he is. He has always been really smart and witty. He is a loving husband and father to two young children and a great friend to many. I think one of my favorite things about Steve is that he can always make me laugh. I mean really laugh like until your sides start to hurt laugh. I love this about him! Steve has gone through so much in his young life and it really hasn’t been fair, but he has still found hope despite the challenges.   I honestly don’t know how he has managed to stay so upbeat and positive. He keeps fighting and I admire him greatly for this.  I will never forget when Steve was first diagnosed with a brain tumor. I was actually with him when he had a sudden grand mal seizure in a coffee shop. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and we later discovered that the seizure was caused by a golf ball sized grade 2 oligoastrocytoma. This discovery would change our lives forever. Steve had an awake craniotomy (brain surgery) in December 2008 to have the tumor removed.  The surgery was successful, but the tumor began to return a few years later in October 2011, at which time Steve wasrequired to undergo six weeks of radiation treatment. I have to brag and say how strong my husband was during the radiation treatment. He received radiation every morning before work and then worked a full day of work without skipping a beat. It really amazes me how he did this without complaint.  You would never have known that he was receiving radiation treatment.   After a few stable years, the tumor began to grow again, and Steve underwent a second awake brain surgery in  September 2016.   A portion of the tumor was removed, but they couldn’t get it all without risking paralyzing him.  Unfortunately, the tumor started to grow again and Steve underwent another series of radiation treatments. This was followed by chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful.  The tumor was growing. Steve started experiencing alarming symptoms that were caused by the tumor. His right arm and right leg became very weak.  He began a new chemotherapy but again the tumor was spreading. Steve had to stop working and continues to be unable to work.  He has lost mobility in his right arm and right leg.  He is also experiencing short term memory issues. We are waiting to see if we are eligible to receive an experimental chemotherapy drug that is very expensive. We may be able to receive this drug as a charitable donation through the company.  Please pray that we do.  Steve has also started eating a Keto diet.  There have been some successful studies and testimonials that show that the Keto diet can help people with brain tumors and we are praying that Steve’s tumor shrinks while on this new way of eating.  Right now, I am Steve’s primary care giver.   I am unable to work because Steve needs daily care.  It has been heartbreaking to watch the person you love the most go through so many struggles.   My children are also watching their Daddy struggle and this is tough as well.  We are asking for donations, however big or small, to help with medical expenses, food for his new diet, and living expenses.  We feel so blessed to have supportive family and friends.   Please consider donating to this fund and if not, then please pray for Steve.   We are praying for a miracle.

Backstory:  As many of you know, 6 months ago, our Dad (Dan Frost), was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. His particular type of cancer is rare and more complex than the majority of prostate cancer cases. Because of this, choosing the right treatment has taken time. The last 6 months we have watched our parents spend countless hours researching, meeting with multiple oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and looked at almost every alternative medicine path available. After much prayer and seeking wisdom in an extremely difficult decision process, our Dad has finally felt peace and made a decision to move forward with 7 weeks of radiation treatment at UCLA Medical Center. He will have two different kinds of radiation that will both target the tumors on his prostate and the area surrounding the prostate, where cancer cells may have migrated.We are a family that believes in the power of prayer and a God who is more than able to heal cancer completely! While we cry out daily to see our Dad healed in this way, we know that he is faithfully walking out the course the Lord has him on for now. Plot Twist: One week away from his scheduled treatment, Dad and Mom received a 30 day notice to leave their home of seven years. Their landlord is selling the property they have been renting in Redding, CA. Because they need to be in LA for 2 months of treatment for Dad, they now only have two weeks to be out of their house. They are quickly packing up their home and placing all their belongings in storage. A few of us kids are taking some time off work to fly out to help them pack and take care of the heavy lifting. They will head to LA with just their suitcases and car, but expectant for God to show them the next steps toward a home. Strongest people we know need help:If you know our story, you know that 17 years ago our parents were called into full time ministry working with political leaders on Capitol Hill. They’ve poured out their life and finances to serve the kingdom. They haven’t skipped a beat in spite of cancer and are continuing to serve. Through this season so many of you have asked us how you can help. As their family we would love if you joined with us in covering them in this process.Prayers:We first and foremost need your prayers. Will you join us as we cover our Dad in the following areas: - Seeking God with us in seeing our Dad’s body completely healed. - Pray for God’s presence and wisdom to guide every doctor in this complicated treatment. - Pray that treatment attacks cancer in every location of our Dad’s body and that it won’t return. - Pray for both our parents to have supernatural strength and that the stress of all the details won’t take a toll on their spirits or bodies.Finances:Cancer not only comes with a heavy burden health wise, but also with a hefty price tag. We are watching our parents bills grow with medical expenses, scans/treatments that are not covered by insurance, cost of travel to appointments out of state, lodging, prescriptions and now the expenses of moving and finding a new home. It is our hearts to go above and beyond to help cover all the extra costs associated with this journey. We would love if you considered joining us by helping them financially. Every little bit helps and will give them one less thing they have to worry about during this incredibly difficult time. Thank you:We also want to recognize and thank all of you who have showed up for our parents in the most profound ways.  Your prayers, notes, phone calls, texts, financial support, houses, helping hands and so much more has so deeply touched the hearts of our parents. We often receive phone calls with our parents in tears from the kindness and generosity that has been shown to them from so many. We can confidently say they have felt so surrounded and loved in this process. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us hold up our parents arms up during a time when they are needing it most!

Medical,22,Healing Hendrix,https://www.gofundme.com/HendrixTorres,"SAN DIEGO, CA","May 20, 2018","$50,000","$49,491","Dear Friends & Family, Most of you are aware that our son Hendrix has been having a pretty rough time the last couple of months. We now think everything began this past November when he was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. Soon after that diagnosis, we noticed he started having motor tics and began complaining of neck pain, nausea and stomachaches. About that same time he started having difficulty at school, pulling away from friends, sports and all of the things he normally loved to do. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of our story. On February 13th, with no previous warning, Hendrix began shaking uncontrollably, slurring his words and making jerky, uncoordinated movements. His eyes were dilated and he was exhibiting the signs and symptoms of a stroke, brain tumor, or a seizure disorder. As you can imagine, even though Jalayne is an RN, we were very scared, especially since Hendrix himself asked to go to the hospital because he could not control his own body. We drove him to the ER, but on the way Hendrix became extremely confused and did not remember where we were going or why. By the time we saw a doctor, Hendrix returned to normal and after a short assessment, he was discharged. Unfortunately, over the next week, Hendrix deteriorated rapidly and was unable to attend school and both of us were unable to go to work.  On the night of the 22nd, Hendrix became so unhinged that we called 911 and left for the ER in restraints in an ambulance. Two hours later, he returned to normal and the hospital discharged him again with nothing more than another basic exam. The next morning, we took Hendrix back to his pediatrician’s office and begged for help and for them to admit him to the hospital for further testing. Finally, Hendrix was admitted to the hospital for three days. After his tests showed relatively normal/benign results, we were told that our son was medically cleared and that we had a behavior issue on our hands and he was discharged. Three hours after that discharge, we had to call 911 again because Hendrix became worse than ever before.  Once again we arrived to the hospital via ambulance with Hendrix on a stretcher. We requested readmission to the medical floor for further testing, but our request was denied since Hendrix had just been medically cleared. We were then advised that the best place for him was the psychiatric unit. We spent three days and two nights in the ER with him waiting for a room to open up on the psychiatric unit. As you might imagine, there are no words to explain the stress, confusion, despair and guilt we felt during that time. Knowing this was a medical issue, we agonized over the best thing to do for our son and ultimately decided to follow our instincts and asked to be discharged immediately.  We returned home and at this point were now in the middle of a full-blown crisis. Our family was completely overwhelmed. It has been devastating for us to helplessly watch the Hendrix we know and love decline and deteriorate physically, mentally, and emotionally right before our eyes. There are no words to describe the nightmare our family has been living. We just wanted our little boy back. After months of dealing with non-responsive caregivers here in California we chose to get on a plane and take Hendrix to the East Coast to see specialists at NYU and St. Peter’s Hospital at Rutgers. So many wonderful souls went out of their way to help us with this complicated, expensive and risky journey traveling across the country with a very sick child. Thankfully the trip was the right decision because Hendrix has finally been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis (along with PANS and Neuropathy) and received his first treatment infusion of IVIG on May 11th just in time for his 10th birthday.  Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain. The doctors believe that the walking pneumonia infection triggered Hendrix’s body to attack his brain causing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as cognitive, memory and movement dysfunction. Hendrix has been plagued with a wax and wane of debilitating symptoms including memory loss, confusion, severe separation anxiety, hallucinations, altered personality and behavior, psychosis, movements that he cannot control, clumsiness, difficulty walking, talking, chewing and swallowing, auditory/sensory issues and sleep disturbances. Basically, his brain is on fire, resulting in a sickness that is nearly impossible to describe. Because of this, we have not been able to leave Hendrix’s side, he has not been able to return to school and we both have been unable to return to work. The positive news is that many children have recovered from encephalitis and the brain has an amazing potential to heal. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment greatly improves his chances of improving. That said, we have a very long and difficult road ahead for all of us. Hendrix needs multiple infusions and extensive cognitive, physical and psychological therapy and at this point we do not know when we will be able to return to work. It's a very scary situation to face.  We continue to live day-by-day and sometimes minute-by-minute. Some days we see more of Hendrix and other days we wonder if we will ever have our son back. We remain positive and are ever hopeful that Hendrix will recover and we will not rest until we have tried everything to save him. We have come to realize that this is more than we can handle alone and are now reaching out to our friends and family asking for help in regards to Hendrix’s medical care and expenses.  We will be grateful for any donation but we completely understand if you are unable to contribute. Prayers for Hendrix and for our family are needed as well.  Thank you!  Beau & Jalayne",359,1.9k,15,367,3 months,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them. Thank you very much.Dmitry.",429,1.2k,8,435,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Duodenal Atresia is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum (in the small intestine). It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. At one day old, Billy had emergency surgery to correct the “kink” in his small intestine. The surgery was successful though Billy spent 5 weeks recovering in the NICU.Fast forward 30 years later, Billy has been able to live life to the fullest. He graduated Dickinson College with a degree in English. Pursued his passion by attending and graduating Tribeca Film Academy in Chicago. Got his dream job at Cutters Studio working his butt off to become Editor, which he achieved January 2018. He met his best friend and the love of this life, Briggs. Not only did he convince his Southern Belle to move from Atlanta to Chicago but he quickly knew to never let her go and married her on March 28th, 2015. I know Billy would still say that was the best day of his life. Until this year. On March 21st, 2018, Briggs and Billy welcomed their beautiful daughter Ann (Annie) Maynard Montross, named in honor of Annie’s grandmothers. If you asked anyone who knows Billy, they would say he is the nicest, kindest, most thoughtful and patient man they know. An accomplished film editor, golfer, hockey player, baseball player, artist, drummer, food enthusiast. I think my grandmother said it best when we were growing up, Billy is the angel in our family. And he is the rock for his two girls, Briggs and Annie. On Thursday, May 24th, Billy admitted himself into New York Presbyterian Hospital suffering from severe stomach pains, soon to be discover it was stemming from his small intestine. Over the next week, Billy underwent 4 surgeries on his small intestine. The initial surgery was to remove the buildup of scar tissue; however, as his condition evolved and his body attempted to recover, his small intestine did not survive his surgeries. Billy is now left with approximately 2 inches remaining of his small intestine (for size reference, the small intestine can range from 9 feet to 35 feet). He is being administered TPN (total parenteral nutrition) through an IV to provide his body the essential nutrients, as he cannot eat or drink, and has a G tube connected to a colostomy bag to continually drain his stomach.He is still in the hospital in NYC. He is making progress with regaining his strength and we hope to have him home within the next week or so.  Billy, Briggs, Annie and the Montross family has been so appreciative of people’s love, support, thoughts and prayers over the past month.

He was 24 and newly married to his wife, Amanda. By the grace of our loving Lord, he enjoyed almost three years of clear scans. As of November 2017, Matt has been in another intense treatment phase. The tumor has regrown and for the moment, continues to grow. BUT GOD. He is making ways in the wilderness, streams in the wasteland. (Isaiah 43:19). We serve a miracle-working God who has already payed the price for our salvation and our healing. (1 Peter 2:24) The unconventional treatment that Matt is in now offers a lot of hope. It is a 12-hour a day job for both he and Amanda, but it is where God has led them, and that is all they need to know to stay on the path He has directed. He is currently into the newest protocol which includes 140+ pills a day, 96 ounces of fresh-pressed juice, multiple doctor’s appointments each week, ongoing consults with doctors across the southeast and outside of the country. The treatments being pursued are not covered by insurance and the costs are staggering. But God always provides. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.” - Matthew 10:29-31 Be steadfast in prayer. We believe we are weeks, days, even minutes away from seeing complete healing in Matt’s body. And that may sound crazy, BUT we know He has already commanded it. He is able and willing. God doesn’t change. He is the same God he was in the Bible. His love for Lazarus, the leper, the blind man, is the same as His love for Matt. He doesn’t deny help or any good thing to those who walk uprightly. (Psalm 84:11) Matt and Amanda do not view the costs of his treatment as anyone else's responsibility but our their own and should people choose to bless us financially, any amount is seen as the greatest gift.

Whether it be his podcast The Shoot, his YouTube channel, or his Instagram, Matt has been promoting, educating, and sharing his love of photography for years. He’s given so much to the photographic community at large, and now it’s time we showed our appreciation and gave back to him.I could try and explain what’s going on, but I think it’s best if it came from Matt’s wife Molly herself:“As many of you know, Matt has had a rough few weeks. I just wanted to get the full story out there to fill in the gaps:Last Friday (6/29/18), he told me he had a migraine. When I got home from work Sunday morning, he apparently had been vomiting all night and couldn't tolerate loud sounds or any light, so I took him to the ER for some fluids and a migraine cocktail. This helped for a while, but that night he started to have fevers. By Tuesday, the headache was worse and he had been consistently vomiting and not voiding, so he went back to the ER where he was treated for dehydration and they considered a lumbar puncture, but decided against it at that time and sent him home. He continued to have high fevers at home, and on Wednesday afternoon, he came out of our room and was covered in a rash and confused. I took him back to the ER and he ended up being admitted. All night his vitals were off. He received lots of fluids to bring his blood pressure up and his heart rate down. He had to be placed on a cooling blanket to bring down his fever. He was eventually moved to the ICU stepdown unit where he has been ever since to closely monitor him. Infectious disease is confident that this is a result from either a tick-borne illness or West Nile virus. He has received doxycycline for the tick illnesses. He is experiencing quite a few complications. He now has pneumonia, a UTI, and inflammation in his brain. His vitals are better now, but today he is experiencing some neurological symptoms that are concerning, so he will be transferred to Riverside. He is stable and talking, he just needs a higher level of care at this point. Thank you so much to all of my wonderful coworkers who have given him THE BEST care. Thank you to all of our friends and family for your help with kids and animals. Thank you for all of your prayers and good vibes sent. He certainly needs them right now. ❤️”Thoughts and prayers are certainly appreciated, but I know we can do more for the Day family right now.

Staying in the hospital in ICU and NICU for a day is insanely costly and both Joslyn and baby have been in the hospital about five days now. Doctors state this is a marathon not a sprint and they expect both Joslyn and baby will remain hospitalized for quite some time. Any financial support we can raise for this family would be such a huge help to them and take a huge financial load off of the shoulders of the family, especially for Joslyn’s husband Jeremy who should only need to focus on his wife and newborn baby, not finances. Anything you can donate is so appreciated by the family and all of their loved ones. I have known Joslyn my entire life (literally since the day I was born) she is my sister, not just my friend. I have known Jeremy now for over a decade as well and I know Jeremy or Joslyn would not do this for themselves, so I am doing it for them. Please donate what you can, anything helps.

The latest life saving procedure included a craniotomy to relieve brain pressure and place her in a paralytic state in order to maintain optimal blood pressure and protect her brain.

Now, Matt needs an Intestinal Transplant.Matt has been diagnosed with a condition called myopathic pseudo-obstruction .  This means that the smooth muscles that move food along in his digestive tract, have stopped working.  As a result, he can no longer eat and has daily episodes of extreme vomiting.  Since he cannot eat, he needs to be fed intravenously with TPN (Total Parental Nutrition) .  Each night he is hooked up to his TPN and it runs over the course of 12 hours, in order for him to live.While TPN is a lifesaver, it comes with some serious long term complications.  TPN is extremely hard on the liver and many people that are on TPN for an extended amount of time will go into liver failure.  In addition, line infections are quite common (Matt has already had two) and can lead to sepsis.  Other health issues associated with long term TPN are developing osteoporosis, cholecystitis and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.The only “cure” for myopathic pseudo-obstruction, is an intestinal transplant.   An intestinal transplant  is the most complex and rare of all the organ transplants.  To give you an idea, last year there were only 109 intestinal transplants compared to 19,850 kidney transplants in the United States.  Due to it rarity and complexity, it is also the most expensive single medical procedure in the U.S., costing a whopping $1.2 million dollars.While Matt has health insurance that will cover the bulk of the medical expenses, there are many additional financial aspects of care and recovery, which are not covered by insurance.  He will spend the first five days in the ICU and is expected to be in the hospital anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks.  During this time his wife will need to take unpaid time off from work, especially in the very beginning.  Dana will be able to stay at a “transplant house” for the first few days after his surgery that is just blocks from hospital, but it is not free.  Once Matt is stable and moved from the ICU, Dana will return home to get back to work and be there for their two girls, Madison and Alexis.During the remainder of his hospital stay Dana and their daughters will commute into the city as often as possible to visit Matt.  Whether it’s by car or mass transit, the costs of going into the city will quickly add up.  Once Matt is finally discharged, he will be coming home on approximately 20 medications, which will cost around $1250 - $1,500 a month out of pocket.  He may also need in home nursing care, which is only partially covered by insurance.  Matt will also need to make weekly trips back into the city to ensure he is progressing and not having an issues with rejection or graft vs. host disease.  With intestinal transplants, there can be many ups and downs over the course of the first year and additional hospital stays are not uncommon.  In addition to the upcoming expenses, his existing medical bills are just under $8,000.  Thank you for considering donating, it's greatly appreciated!

Steve is an inspiration to me and I’m sure to many of you as well. As many of you are aware, Steve and his wonderful family find themselves battling cancer for the third time. He’s been receiving monthly chemo/immunotherapy treatments at the Mayo Clinic since August 2017. While the treatments have stopped cancer growth in some areas, other areas continue to grow. As a result of genomic testing of the cancer, it was discovered that his cancer is most likely being driven by a specific mutation in the BRAF Gene. While there is no FDA approved targeted therapy for this specific BRAF mutation, MD Anderson is running a Phase 1 clinical trial with a drug that they believe has a chance to work on his cancer. Steve and Wendy traveled to Houston this week where he has been going through 3 days of multiple tests and a biopsy of one of the tumors. Fortunately, Steve has passed the screening and has been accepted into the trial that is testing the drug LXH254. This drug was developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. His first day on the trial will be Monday, April 16th. Steve and his family are grateful to his team of doctors at Mayo Clinic, who referred him to MD Anderson.While these treatments provide Steve with hope, they also bring forth tremendous costs, and I am hoping as a community we can assist the Rogers family in this battle against this awful disease.

My wife Jules and I are shocked and saddened utterly devastated to announce that our lives have been completely upended by the discovery of what looks to be stage 4 neuroblastoma in our amazing 15 month old daughter Karin Quinn aka “Kiki.”Whether you call her Karin, Quinn, Kiki or Baby Q, the fact remains- she is amazing and uniquely fun, smart, and beautiful- our only daughter and the center of our world. On June 14, Jules and Barbara Dockery took Quinn to her pediatrician to check out whether Baby’s cute pot belly was anything to worry about.  He recommended an ultrasound to be sure. She immediately underwent an ultrasound procedure at Tarzana Children’s Hospital which revealed a large mass on her liver. Julie and Quinn were transported via ambulance to UCLA for admission. Here we remain. An MRI and CT scan revealed that Quinn has what appears to be a rare, aggressive and particularly lethal form of cancer known as neuroblastoma, an evil disease that lurks in healthy babies and then strikes. In diagnosing this disease, Kiki underwent two biopsies, one on the mass itself (about the size of potato, located next to her liver), and another sample from her pelvic bone. They are anticipating that the cancer has spread to her bones.  It will take more time to confirm this, but what is being discussed now is the reality of stage four neuroblastoma. This is as bad as it gets. In our future is the entire spectrum of aggressive cancer treatments. Our precious baby will be subjected to Chemo, radiation, surgery, stem cells, and possibly be brought to the brink of death in order to heal from this terrible disease.  No less than 3 lives are on the line. The outpouring of support we’ve received from our friends and family is incredible.  Many have asked what, if anything can be done to help. First, hug your loved ones and be kind to them. Second, donate blood, if you can. Third, send healing thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to baby Quinn. We really really need to catch a lucky break. Without prompting, Julie’s sister Crystal initiated this gofundme page in support of Kiki.

This is a man who doesn't leave the house without singles in his pocket so that he always has something to give street performers or just someone in need. And now we're asking for that same spirit of generosity he shows everyone around him to be paid forward to Nikki and his growing family. Nikki and Annie are approaching this daunting year ""with as much hope, determination and positivity as possible.""  Let's help them keep positive and focused by lightening the load of medical bills, trips to the hospital, general expenses and possible time off from employment to focus on healing.  Prayers for a full and easy recovery are also deeply appreciated.  Thank you.",356,859,4,359,1 month,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Because his pressures (both brain and blood) are still too high, the doctors have had him sedated throughout the process, and we have no idea as to what type of damage has been done to his brain and body. For those that don’t know, my dad has operated his own family run, small business for the last 20+ years as a Chiropractor, earnestly seeking to improve the quality of life of everyone he comes into contact with. Famous for providing more care for less money, dad did whatever it took to leave his patients better than he found them, while still providing for his family. However, because my family’s only source of income was my father’s business, we now need your help in this difficult time. As we continue to pray for a miracle, my mother has not left his side, and my brothers and I continue to do all we can to ease the pressures of this situation. Though the amount may seem high, the cost of care is already enormous, and even the most optimistic of outcomes leads to at least another 2-3 weeks of 24/7 care in the ICU. Even if you cannot give, we ask that you tell your friends and family about our struggle, and say a prayer whenever you can for his recovery.

After 3 rounds of BEP we thought we had the “all clear” but, just before Jan 2018, we found out that the cancer was back and had started to spread.

From the early stages of our relationship, it became clear that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We got engaged in Alaska and had an amazing wedding nearly five years ago. We’ve been together for over ten years now. We’ve always dreamt that our life together would include children, and over two years ago, we started trying for our first child. That was a journey of its own...as many can attest to, we (naively) did not anticipate difficulty in conceiving a child. The morning after Thanksgiving in 2017, I was brushing my teeth and decided to take a pregnancy test. It was positive. Have you ever felt a joy so electric that it completely takes over every fiber of your being? This was that feeling, and that feeling continued to grow as baby grew too. At our 21-week anatomy scan, we found out that it’s a girl! Luckily, we had already agreed on the perfect name for our sweet summer daughter - Juniper.The days following that scan turned our happiness and excitement into what can only be described as primal fear. We received a very unexpected call that we would need to have a follow-up appointment with the maternal fetal medicine clinic for a level 2 ultrasound, as they were not able to get images of all four chambers of her heart at the anatomy scan. (Cue panic.) What resulted from the level 2 ultrasound raised more specific concerns regarding June’s heart, including a suspected diagnosis of heterotaxy. (Cue confusion and more panic.) We were then referred to the pediatric cardiology team at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, where a fetal echocardiogram revealed yet more details on Juniper’s congenital heart defects and provided us with a clearer pathway to treatment. The incredibly high quality of care we’ve been receiving at the University of Minnesota has helped bring some relief back into our lives; we know we are in great hands there. From what Juniper’s care team can currently determine (in utero), she has several congenital heart defects specific to her condition including HLHS/single ventricle, VSD, ASD, malposition of the great arteries and pulmonary atresia, in addition to her stomach being on the right side of her body. Essentially, this means that she will need a series of surgeries in order to maintain function of her heart and other organs to be able to live out her life like she very much deserves to do. Currently, she is projected to have four heart surgeries throughout her life...the first of which will happen soon after she is born. Since success of the first surgery will be dependent on a multitude of assessments made at birth, we are looking at a lengthy first stay in the hospital for recovery time before we can take our daughter home.The time we will both be able to spend with our new baby while she is in the NICU/CICU will be so important for many reasons; being present to make important medical decisions regarding her recovery and future outlook, gaining knowledge and skills to be able to care for her special needs in and out of the hospital, and of course, loving on her as much as is humanly possible.We’ve wanted this beautiful baby for so long and we have been saving up the best we can, though we could never have anticipated our version of parenthood to look quite like this. Though I am fortunate enough to have qualified for 12 weeks of FMLA leave and can use what little sick time I’ve accrued in my first year of teaching, the remainder is all unpaid. Colin can use some hours he’s saved up to take some paid time off, but he has recently been informed of an unexpected transition in position which has resulted in a reduction of pay. I had intended to teach summer school, but following the advice of our care team, I will instead take these last few weeks of pregnancy to focus on my health. Colin will be working overtime as he can in the weeks left leading up to June’s birth to help supplement our sudden change in income. We are navigating it all the best we can given the cards we have been dealt, but we anticipate that being in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time will prove challenging in more ways than one. During the months of my maternity leave following Juniper’s birth, we will undoubtedly face financial difficulty with bills coming in from all angles, month-to-month expenses on a single, reduced income, medical supplies and medications we will need when we make the transition home, hospital life (meals, parking, etc.), and very importantly, saving up for all of the above when we go through this yet again for future surgeries. We are being reminded, over and over again, that life never stops, even when you’re in desperate need of a pause button. If we could alleviate at least one of the difficulties our family will face in the uncertain times ahead, it could really help us adjust to our new normal in the long run, whenever that may be. If you know us, you know that we’ve put off setting up this GoFundMe for quite some time. (Turns out it is really difficult to ask for help when you’d much rather give it than put yourself out there to receive it...especially when it involves financial support.) But, after a lot of encouragement and strong suggestion from our loved ones in light of recent events, we decided to open it up and accept any and all assistance offered to us. Thank you for taking the time to read our story. We appreciate all of you.So much love from our family to yours,Chelsea and Colin Clark",256,876,15,258,2 months,11 hours ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Medical,25,Colleen Stevens &  Family,https://www.gofundme.com/colleenstevens,"SPRINGFIELD, IL","March 18, 2018","$50,000","$46,990","Colleen is a 34 year old mother of three young children ages 6, 4, 1 and is married to her loving husband Joe.  On January 31, 2018, she went into respiratory arrest due to a very rare autoimmune disease called Wegener's Granulomatosis.  This caused a complete blockage in her airway that caused her to then go into respiratory arrest and caused an ischemic stroke.  She was in ICU for several days and then admitted into the hospital for weeks where she lost her ability to speak, was blind for several days, lost movement of her legs and hands.  She was finally moved to the physical therapy floor of the hospital where she worked to regain her speech, learned to walk again, and was regaining her movement in her hands, legs, and vision was slowly coming back.  After 27 days, she was released to go home and entered out patient therapy.  We thought this was the end of her hospital story,  and we were looking forward to watching her regain her independence back....but it wasn't even close to the end of the story.Last Saturday, Colleen's husband Joe rushed Colleen to the ER with shortness of breath and another restricted airway.   She was released and the following day they headed to St. Louis to see her specialist at Barnes Hospital.  On their way, Colleen had ANOTHER blockage of her airway and her husband had to perform the Heimlich Maneuver to move the large obstruction.  Her specialist put her on high dosage of steroids to try and help the blockages that were forming.  They went home and the next morning (TUES.) she woke up and felt like her airway was BLOCKED again.  We took her to the ENT where she was checked and released but two hours later felt that the blockage was still there.  We took her back to the ENT where they discovered a 98% blockage was below her vocal cords not above them as we have always thought.  She was immediately rushed into surgery and released the next day to go home on Wednesday.  By Thursday morning, she again woke up at home to a feeling of another blockage of her airway.  We rushed her to the ER, where they discovered another blockage under her vocal cords. These blockages were being removed and coming back within 24 hours and blocking her entire airway.  They immediately took her for her SECOND surgery and put her into the hospital to be monitored 24 hours a day.  They gave her high doses of steroids hoping that might help but by Friday morning these blockages were back and Colleen was going in for her THIRD surgery in THREE days.At this point, we were devastated by this news.  We needed help.  Her doctors at Memorial Hospital and her doctor at Barnes were working together to find out as much as possible regarding Wegener's and what could be done to help her.  Her doctor at Barnes was able to contact doctors at Harvard and Cleveland to find out some good information on treatment. By Saturday morning, Colleen had her FOURTH surgery in FOUR days to remove yet ANOTHER blockage.  After a lot of discussions by the doctors at Memorial, Barnes, Harvard, and Cleveland they removed the blockage and also injected steroids and topical chemotherapy into the trachea.  They also started Colleen on a chemotherapy drug, which will be given once a week for four weeks to try and help her.  She will continue to be in the hospital so that they can monitor her 24 hours a day and be sure she has a clear airway daily and hope that the chemotherapy treatment along with the steroid injections all work together to put her Wegener's in remission.  Colleen's husband Joe has been out of work for over a month now and will continue to have to stay with her until the doctors give the okay for her to go home.  They are going to need to add a system to their two home heating and air systems that adds moisture into their house.  The stress alone of being in the hospital away from your kids would make it hard on any family and then add in regular bills, the doctors bills and the continued physical therapy Colleen will still need when she does come home, and the heating/air system that is essential for her to have that this family just needs some help from family, friends, and maybe even the kindness of strangers.  So many of you have reached out to help, so I think this would be a great way to help alleviate some of the stress that the Stevens family  has due to this horrific disease that has turned this family's world upside down. Thank you to all those willing to help them during their time of need.",451,925,5,455,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Nathaniel set off to hike and climb Forbidden Peak, a famous climbing destination in the North Cascades. During his climb, he fell over 150 feet and sustained a severe spinal cord injury. Due to the actions of his climbing partner and another pair of climbers, Nathaniel was safely airlifted off the mountain to Harborview Medical Center. He underwent a successful surgery to stabilize his injuries, but the current prognosis is still dire - due to the damage on his C2-C7 vertebrae, he initially had no sensation or mobility below his neck.  But we’ve been witnessing small miracles this week, as he is now able to move his left arm, so we’re still hopeful for more improvements. He is currently still in the ICU, and is unable to breathe on his own at this time. Nathaniel had just completed his first year at the Dental School at the University of Washington, and he was passionate about many subjects and his thirst for exploration pushed him to pursue a life in the outdoors. He spent many hours in the calmness and beauty of Washington’s wilderness and climbing areas. Our hopes and dreams as a family is that he may one day return to the great outdoors. What Nathaniel Needs From UsNathaniel has positively impacted so many lives. We would like to acknowledge the overwhelming support from Nathaniel's friends, classmates, family and church.

Among many things, SJS attacks the mucus membranes and left his lungs severely damaged. He went from being a successful multisport athlete and student, to one that struggled aerobically on the field. Not willing to quit, he trained to become a Goal Keeper hoping he could reduce the cardiovascular demands on his body and hoping he could continue to play the game he loved. Dylan adjusted to his new base line of 50% lung capacity and still competed at some of the highest club and high school soccer levels. His teammates will remember him as the player who finished the runs long after the rest of the team, but he always finished. His determination and commitment to everything he did was admirable. Over the past 4 years his lungs declined further from a MRSSA infection and then Pneumonia. At 18%, he had to make the hardest call of his life to the college coach he had committed to play soccer for in Minnesota; his primary concern was not himself, but for the teammates that he knew would depend on him. Evaluation began in September 2017 at University of Washington Medical Center for potential Bilateral Lung Transplant. On Saturday, July 14th Dylan received the incredible gift of new Lungs from a donor, something he can only repay by making the same commitment to life he always has. This type of organ transplant is a very intensive surgery that comes with life-long requirements for medications and treatments. The love and support of all his family and friends has gotten him through this and his motivation to use this gift in positive ways is evident in everything he does.""Want to succeed as bad as you want to breath"" ~Dylan",142,383,9,142,1 month,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

My husband’s name is Stephen Boulanger and he has been struggling with brain cancer since November 2008. If any of you know Steve personally then you would know what a fun, amazing person he is. He has always been really smart and witty. He is a loving husband and father to two young children and a great friend to many. I think one of my favorite things about Steve is that he can always make me laugh. I mean really laugh like until your sides start to hurt laugh. I love this about him! Steve has gone through so much in his young life and it really hasn’t been fair, but he has still found hope despite the challenges.   I honestly don’t know how he has managed to stay so upbeat and positive. He keeps fighting and I admire him greatly for this.  I will never forget when Steve was first diagnosed with a brain tumor. I was actually with him when he had a sudden grand mal seizure in a coffee shop. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and we later discovered that the seizure was caused by a golf ball sized grade 2 oligoastrocytoma. This discovery would change our lives forever. Steve had an awake craniotomy (brain surgery) in December 2008 to have the tumor removed.  The surgery was successful, but the tumor began to return a few years later in October 2011, at which time Steve wasrequired to undergo six weeks of radiation treatment. I have to brag and say how strong my husband was during the radiation treatment. He received radiation every morning before work and then worked a full day of work without skipping a beat. It really amazes me how he did this without complaint.  You would never have known that he was receiving radiation treatment.   After a few stable years, the tumor began to grow again, and Steve underwent a second awake brain surgery in  September 2016.   A portion of the tumor was removed, but they couldn’t get it all without risking paralyzing him.  Unfortunately, the tumor started to grow again and Steve underwent another series of radiation treatments. This was followed by chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful.  The tumor was growing. Steve started experiencing alarming symptoms that were caused by the tumor. His right arm and right leg became very weak.  He began a new chemotherapy but again the tumor was spreading. Steve had to stop working and continues to be unable to work.  He has lost mobility in his right arm and right leg.  He is also experiencing short term memory issues. We are waiting to see if we are eligible to receive an experimental chemotherapy drug that is very expensive. We may be able to receive this drug as a charitable donation through the company.  Please pray that we do.  Steve has also started eating a Keto diet.  There have been some successful studies and testimonials that show that the Keto diet can help people with brain tumors and we are praying that Steve’s tumor shrinks while on this new way of eating.  Right now, I am Steve’s primary care giver.   I am unable to work because Steve needs daily care.  It has been heartbreaking to watch the person you love the most go through so many struggles.   My children are also watching their Daddy struggle and this is tough as well.  We are asking for donations, however big or small, to help with medical expenses, food for his new diet, and living expenses.  We feel so blessed to have supportive family and friends.   Please consider donating to this fund and if not, then please pray for Steve.   We are praying for a miracle.

Backstory:  As many of you know, 6 months ago, our Dad (Dan Frost), was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. His particular type of cancer is rare and more complex than the majority of prostate cancer cases. Because of this, choosing the right treatment has taken time. The last 6 months we have watched our parents spend countless hours researching, meeting with multiple oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and looked at almost every alternative medicine path available. After much prayer and seeking wisdom in an extremely difficult decision process, our Dad has finally felt peace and made a decision to move forward with 7 weeks of radiation treatment at UCLA Medical Center. He will have two different kinds of radiation that will both target the tumors on his prostate and the area surrounding the prostate, where cancer cells may have migrated.We are a family that believes in the power of prayer and a God who is more than able to heal cancer completely! While we cry out daily to see our Dad healed in this way, we know that he is faithfully walking out the course the Lord has him on for now. Plot Twist: One week away from his scheduled treatment, Dad and Mom received a 30 day notice to leave their home of seven years. Their landlord is selling the property they have been renting in Redding, CA. Because they need to be in LA for 2 months of treatment for Dad, they now only have two weeks to be out of their house. They are quickly packing up their home and placing all their belongings in storage. A few of us kids are taking some time off work to fly out to help them pack and take care of the heavy lifting. They will head to LA with just their suitcases and car, but expectant for God to show them the next steps toward a home. Strongest people we know need help:If you know our story, you know that 17 years ago our parents were called into full time ministry working with political leaders on Capitol Hill. They’ve poured out their life and finances to serve the kingdom. They haven’t skipped a beat in spite of cancer and are continuing to serve. Through this season so many of you have asked us how you can help. As their family we would love if you joined with us in covering them in this process.Prayers:We first and foremost need your prayers. Will you join us as we cover our Dad in the following areas: - Seeking God with us in seeing our Dad’s body completely healed. - Pray for God’s presence and wisdom to guide every doctor in this complicated treatment. - Pray that treatment attacks cancer in every location of our Dad’s body and that it won’t return. - Pray for both our parents to have supernatural strength and that the stress of all the details won’t take a toll on their spirits or bodies.Finances:Cancer not only comes with a heavy burden health wise, but also with a hefty price tag. We are watching our parents bills grow with medical expenses, scans/treatments that are not covered by insurance, cost of travel to appointments out of state, lodging, prescriptions and now the expenses of moving and finding a new home. It is our hearts to go above and beyond to help cover all the extra costs associated with this journey. We would love if you considered joining us by helping them financially. Every little bit helps and will give them one less thing they have to worry about during this incredibly difficult time. Thank you:We also want to recognize and thank all of you who have showed up for our parents in the most profound ways.  Your prayers, notes, phone calls, texts, financial support, houses, helping hands and so much more has so deeply touched the hearts of our parents. We often receive phone calls with our parents in tears from the kindness and generosity that has been shown to them from so many. We can confidently say they have felt so surrounded and loved in this process. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping us hold up our parents arms up during a time when they are needing it most!

Medical,22,Healing Hendrix,https://www.gofundme.com/HendrixTorres,"SAN DIEGO, CA","May 20, 2018","$50,000","$49,491","Dear Friends & Family, Most of you are aware that our son Hendrix has been having a pretty rough time the last couple of months. We now think everything began this past November when he was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. Soon after that diagnosis, we noticed he started having motor tics and began complaining of neck pain, nausea and stomachaches. About that same time he started having difficulty at school, pulling away from friends, sports and all of the things he normally loved to do. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of our story. On February 13th, with no previous warning, Hendrix began shaking uncontrollably, slurring his words and making jerky, uncoordinated movements. His eyes were dilated and he was exhibiting the signs and symptoms of a stroke, brain tumor, or a seizure disorder. As you can imagine, even though Jalayne is an RN, we were very scared, especially since Hendrix himself asked to go to the hospital because he could not control his own body. We drove him to the ER, but on the way Hendrix became extremely confused and did not remember where we were going or why. By the time we saw a doctor, Hendrix returned to normal and after a short assessment, he was discharged. Unfortunately, over the next week, Hendrix deteriorated rapidly and was unable to attend school and both of us were unable to go to work.  On the night of the 22nd, Hendrix became so unhinged that we called 911 and left for the ER in restraints in an ambulance. Two hours later, he returned to normal and the hospital discharged him again with nothing more than another basic exam. The next morning, we took Hendrix back to his pediatrician’s office and begged for help and for them to admit him to the hospital for further testing. Finally, Hendrix was admitted to the hospital for three days. After his tests showed relatively normal/benign results, we were told that our son was medically cleared and that we had a behavior issue on our hands and he was discharged. Three hours after that discharge, we had to call 911 again because Hendrix became worse than ever before.  Once again we arrived to the hospital via ambulance with Hendrix on a stretcher. We requested readmission to the medical floor for further testing, but our request was denied since Hendrix had just been medically cleared. We were then advised that the best place for him was the psychiatric unit. We spent three days and two nights in the ER with him waiting for a room to open up on the psychiatric unit. As you might imagine, there are no words to explain the stress, confusion, despair and guilt we felt during that time. Knowing this was a medical issue, we agonized over the best thing to do for our son and ultimately decided to follow our instincts and asked to be discharged immediately.  We returned home and at this point were now in the middle of a full-blown crisis. Our family was completely overwhelmed. It has been devastating for us to helplessly watch the Hendrix we know and love decline and deteriorate physically, mentally, and emotionally right before our eyes. There are no words to describe the nightmare our family has been living. We just wanted our little boy back. After months of dealing with non-responsive caregivers here in California we chose to get on a plane and take Hendrix to the East Coast to see specialists at NYU and St. Peter’s Hospital at Rutgers. So many wonderful souls went out of their way to help us with this complicated, expensive and risky journey traveling across the country with a very sick child. Thankfully the trip was the right decision because Hendrix has finally been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis (along with PANS and Neuropathy) and received his first treatment infusion of IVIG on May 11th just in time for his 10th birthday.  Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain. The doctors believe that the walking pneumonia infection triggered Hendrix’s body to attack his brain causing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as cognitive, memory and movement dysfunction. Hendrix has been plagued with a wax and wane of debilitating symptoms including memory loss, confusion, severe separation anxiety, hallucinations, altered personality and behavior, psychosis, movements that he cannot control, clumsiness, difficulty walking, talking, chewing and swallowing, auditory/sensory issues and sleep disturbances. Basically, his brain is on fire, resulting in a sickness that is nearly impossible to describe. Because of this, we have not been able to leave Hendrix’s side, he has not been able to return to school and we both have been unable to return to work. The positive news is that many children have recovered from encephalitis and the brain has an amazing potential to heal. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment greatly improves his chances of improving. That said, we have a very long and difficult road ahead for all of us. Hendrix needs multiple infusions and extensive cognitive, physical and psychological therapy and at this point we do not know when we will be able to return to work. It's a very scary situation to face.  We continue to live day-by-day and sometimes minute-by-minute. Some days we see more of Hendrix and other days we wonder if we will ever have our son back. We remain positive and are ever hopeful that Hendrix will recover and we will not rest until we have tried everything to save him. We have come to realize that this is more than we can handle alone and are now reaching out to our friends and family asking for help in regards to Hendrix’s medical care and expenses.  We will be grateful for any donation but we completely understand if you are unable to contribute. Prayers for Hendrix and for our family are needed as well.  Thank you!  Beau & Jalayne",359,1.9k,15,367,3 months,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them. Thank you very much.Dmitry.",429,1.2k,8,435,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Duodenal Atresia is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum (in the small intestine). It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. At one day old, Billy had emergency surgery to correct the “kink” in his small intestine. The surgery was successful though Billy spent 5 weeks recovering in the NICU.Fast forward 30 years later, Billy has been able to live life to the fullest. He graduated Dickinson College with a degree in English. Pursued his passion by attending and graduating Tribeca Film Academy in Chicago. Got his dream job at Cutters Studio working his butt off to become Editor, which he achieved January 2018. He met his best friend and the love of this life, Briggs. Not only did he convince his Southern Belle to move from Atlanta to Chicago but he quickly knew to never let her go and married her on March 28th, 2015. I know Billy would still say that was the best day of his life. Until this year. On March 21st, 2018, Briggs and Billy welcomed their beautiful daughter Ann (Annie) Maynard Montross, named in honor of Annie’s grandmothers. If you asked anyone who knows Billy, they would say he is the nicest, kindest, most thoughtful and patient man they know. An accomplished film editor, golfer, hockey player, baseball player, artist, drummer, food enthusiast. I think my grandmother said it best when we were growing up, Billy is the angel in our family. And he is the rock for his two girls, Briggs and Annie. On Thursday, May 24th, Billy admitted himself into New York Presbyterian Hospital suffering from severe stomach pains, soon to be discover it was stemming from his small intestine. Over the next week, Billy underwent 4 surgeries on his small intestine. The initial surgery was to remove the buildup of scar tissue; however, as his condition evolved and his body attempted to recover, his small intestine did not survive his surgeries. Billy is now left with approximately 2 inches remaining of his small intestine (for size reference, the small intestine can range from 9 feet to 35 feet). He is being administered TPN (total parenteral nutrition) through an IV to provide his body the essential nutrients, as he cannot eat or drink, and has a G tube connected to a colostomy bag to continually drain his stomach.He is still in the hospital in NYC. He is making progress with regaining his strength and we hope to have him home within the next week or so.  Billy, Briggs, Annie and the Montross family has been so appreciative of people’s love, support, thoughts and prayers over the past month.

He was released there after two weeks at the hospital. He is expected to return home for continued therapy there  on April 20th. From there it is expected he will have months of therapy before there is hope of a full recovery.Many of you know Doug as a long-standing Aspen Valley resident and manager of Rustique.

He was 24 and newly married to his wife, Amanda. By the grace of our loving Lord, he enjoyed almost three years of clear scans. As of November 2017, Matt has been in another intense treatment phase. The tumor has regrown and for the moment, continues to grow. BUT GOD. He is making ways in the wilderness, streams in the wasteland. (Isaiah 43:19). We serve a miracle-working God who has already payed the price for our salvation and our healing. (1 Peter 2:24) The unconventional treatment that Matt is in now offers a lot of hope. It is a 12-hour a day job for both he and Amanda, but it is where God has led them, and that is all they need to know to stay on the path He has directed. He is currently into the newest protocol which includes 140+ pills a day, 96 ounces of fresh-pressed juice, multiple doctor’s appointments each week, ongoing consults with doctors across the southeast and outside of the country. The treatments being pursued are not covered by insurance and the costs are staggering. But God always provides. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.” - Matthew 10:29-31 Be steadfast in prayer. We believe we are weeks, days, even minutes away from seeing complete healing in Matt’s body. And that may sound crazy, BUT we know He has already commanded it. He is able and willing. God doesn’t change. He is the same God he was in the Bible. His love for Lazarus, the leper, the blind man, is the same as His love for Matt. He doesn’t deny help or any good thing to those who walk uprightly. (Psalm 84:11) Matt and Amanda do not view the costs of his treatment as anyone else's responsibility but our their own and should people choose to bless us financially, any amount is seen as the greatest gift.

Whether it be his podcast The Shoot, his YouTube channel, or his Instagram, Matt has been promoting, educating, and sharing his love of photography for years. He’s given so much to the photographic community at large, and now it’s time we showed our appreciation and gave back to him.I could try and explain what’s going on, but I think it’s best if it came from Matt’s wife Molly herself:“As many of you know, Matt has had a rough few weeks. I just wanted to get the full story out there to fill in the gaps:Last Friday (6/29/18), he told me he had a migraine. When I got home from work Sunday morning, he apparently had been vomiting all night and couldn't tolerate loud sounds or any light, so I took him to the ER for some fluids and a migraine cocktail. This helped for a while, but that night he started to have fevers. By Tuesday, the headache was worse and he had been consistently vomiting and not voiding, so he went back to the ER where he was treated for dehydration and they considered a lumbar puncture, but decided against it at that time and sent him home. He continued to have high fevers at home, and on Wednesday afternoon, he came out of our room and was covered in a rash and confused. I took him back to the ER and he ended up being admitted. All night his vitals were off. He received lots of fluids to bring his blood pressure up and his heart rate down. He had to be placed on a cooling blanket to bring down his fever. He was eventually moved to the ICU stepdown unit where he has been ever since to closely monitor him. Infectious disease is confident that this is a result from either a tick-borne illness or West Nile virus. He has received doxycycline for the tick illnesses. He is experiencing quite a few complications. He now has pneumonia, a UTI, and inflammation in his brain. His vitals are better now, but today he is experiencing some neurological symptoms that are concerning, so he will be transferred to Riverside. He is stable and talking, he just needs a higher level of care at this point. Thank you so much to all of my wonderful coworkers who have given him THE BEST care. Thank you to all of our friends and family for your help with kids and animals. Thank you for all of your prayers and good vibes sent. He certainly needs them right now. ❤️”Thoughts and prayers are certainly appreciated, but I know we can do more for the Day family right now.

Jeremy and Joslyn were finally blessed with their first pregnancy in 2017 after about a year of fertility treatments because they weren’t conceiving on their own. Joslyn has wanted to be a mommy forever. Joslyn and Jeremy had their first child on Monday 6/18/2018, but it was not the fairytale birth and celebration that every parent hopes for. Joslyn had to be induced early (about a month) and during the preparation for induction, Joslyn began having severe breathing issues. She lost consciousness and she flatlined for 15 minutes. They were able to get the baby out within five minutes of Joslyn flat-lining. Both mom and baby are fighting hard for their lives. Joslyn remains in an induced coma to allow her brain and body to heal from all the trauma. Baby is also in an induced coma. Both mom and baby are stable at this time, but the prognosis is still completely up in the air at this point. Staying in the hospital in ICU and NICU for a day is insanely costly and both Joslyn and baby have been in the hospital about five days now. Doctors state this is a marathon not a sprint and they expect both Joslyn and baby will remain hospitalized for quite some time. Any financial support we can raise for this family would be such a huge help to them and take a huge financial load off of the shoulders of the family, especially for Joslyn’s husband Jeremy who should only need to focus on his wife and newborn baby, not finances. Anything you can donate is so appreciated by the family and all of their loved ones. I have known Joslyn my entire life (literally since the day I was born) she is my sister, not just my friend. I have known Jeremy now for over a decade as well and I know Jeremy or Joslyn would not do this for themselves, so I am doing it for them. Please donate what you can, anything helps. Thank you all!",679,3.8k,19,649,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

The latest life saving procedure included a craniotomy to relieve brain pressure and place her in a paralytic state in order to maintain optimal blood pressure and protect her brain. 

From the beginning, we have known this road to recovery will be a long one… not months, but years. Her prognosis is only the first step.  Since Kati is half of her self-employed family, taking Jeff off the road will significantly impact the family financially.  The GoFund Me funds would be a critical part of allowing Jeff to focus on Kati and their children.  Funds will go a long way to help cover medical and household expenses while  allowing Jeff to focus on Kati’s recovery.  It will also enable Jeff to stay as close as possible to family, doctors, and friends, and to get Kati through this traumatic experience and back to her larger than life self.",236,771,14,231,5 days,3 days ago,2 days,2018-09-03
