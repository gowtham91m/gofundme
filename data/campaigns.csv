Medical,1,Olivia Stoy:Transplant & Liv it up!,https://www.gofundme.com/olivia-stoy-bone-marrow-transplant,"ASHLEY, IN","May 18, 2018",$1.0M,"$316,576","Update: Many fundraisers have been put into place to raise funds for the Stoy Family to cover the cost of the transplant. Nearly a month into fundraising, Olivia's story had reached so many people that the initial goal was met! $350,000 was the cost of the initial procedure and does not include additional treatment: hospital stays longer than the allotted 50 days, medications, time off of work, and travel expenses. Depending on how fast Olivia's health progresses after the transplant, additional bills could add up fast. Now, Olivia wants to use this experience to bring light to childhood cancer and raise additional money for other children in medical battles of their own. As a result, she created Liv It Up , a campaign designed to shed light on the struggles of childhood cancer through her own personal experiences and those of families she has met along the way. In an effort to help her through the recovery process, Olivia wants to raise $1 million for Liv It Up, to help give young cancer patients a chance at being a kid and their parents the peace of mind that they will have help paying for life-saving medical treatments like Olivia's.Olivia Stoy was an active 12 year old girl, finishing her first year at Angola Middle School. What was thought to be a lingering cold turned out to be something much more serious. Olivia was sent from a local hospital to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and was eventually diagnosed with T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.  Right away, her team of doctors worked on her treatment plan.  Of course, there were a few bumps in the road: a chemo medication that at normal strength caused Olivia to have seizures; an infection which meant an automatic 2 week stay in the hospital; not to mention all of the trips to and from Riley in between those events.  But after all the ups and downs on February 14, 2017 Olivia was declared cancer free but would need to continue treatments through September 2018 to increase the chances of her cancer not returning.During this time, many people asked how they could help, how could they donate. The Stoy family was not in need of funds at the time and Olivia wanted to make sure other kids could benefit from the work of the Child Life Specialists at Riley and Cancer Research. All money was directed to the Riley Foundation where Olivia chose it’s route. To date, over $50,000 has been donated to Riley in Olivia’s name. In March 2018, just one year after celebrating Olivia being cancer free, Olivia’s cancer returned. It was devastating for all who followed her story. Right away the doctors at Riley worked on a plan for Olivia’s relapse. The plan consisted of several rounds of chemotherapy and once the cancer is gone a bone marrow transplant will be needed. After testing members of Olivia’s immediate family, her brother was found to be a 100% match! The Stoy family is part of a faith sharing insurance plan that does not cover organ transplants, including bone marrow transplants. While the family has appealed to the insurance board, on May 14, 2018 the sharing/insurance plan declined coverage of the bone marrow transplant which is the recommended treatment option by doctors at Riley Hospital for Olivia’s survival.We are fundraising for the Stoy Family to help cover the cost of the bone marrow transplant. The original estimate is $900,000. The family has negotiated a price with the hospital and needs to raise $350,000 before for the bone marrow transplant can take place which is estimated to begin July 2018. Should any complication arise during Olivia’s treatment additional funds will be needed. If funds are raised that exceed the amount needed for the bone marrow transplant, the hope is that this fund can provide to other childhood cancer patients and their families for years to come in honor of Olivia Stoy, a true fighter and inspiration to so many!Tax deductible checks can be made out to “Liv it Up” and mailed to Pleasant Lake Mennonite Church | c/o Liv It Up | 5142 S.

Medical,1,Claire Wineland Needs Our Help,https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire,"GARDEN GROVE, CA","June 12, 2018","$225,000","$264,710","First of all, WOW!! We have been blown away by the amazing outpouring of love and support you have shown to Claire..deeply humbled in fact.  Friends have encouraged us to raise the goal to meet the demand but I want everyone to know that our transplant finances have been covered in full.  Anything additional you choose to donate will be to show Claire your love and to help her do something amazing post transplant.  She is full of wonderful ideas but first new lungs, then look out world! :) <3 ""Death is inevitable, but living a life we are proud of is something we can control"". ~ Claire Wineland Some of you may have heard one of Claire Wineland's  many inspirational speeches at events such as PTTOW, THRIVE: Make Money Matter, WORLDZ, Zappos, Klick Health, TEDx, OMED and AARC or possibly you follow her on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram   or YouTube  but one thing about her is she never asks for help for herself, she is a stubborn little force of nature and determined to  live her life to the fullest despite her failing health and is always, always of service to others and shares her message far and wide. This last year, her decline due to having Cystic Fibrosis  (CF) has been drastic.  She is unable to do the work that she loves, which is traveling the world to share her message with thousands of people, she is using a wheelchair due to shortness of breath to walk more than 100ft and her quality of life has become just about staying alive. ￼ This is not the Claire we all know and love. ￼  She has recently been placed on the UCSD Lung Transplant list and is anxiously awaiting the call for new lungs.  A new start, a new chapter #metamorphosis.  Again, we want to make sure that everyone knows this money will not be used for the transplant itself, we do have medical insurance. But the ancillary costs  and medication co pays before, during and after can be considerable, and as you know, she is already struggling to make ends meet and is unable to work. Full recovery can take approximately 6 months post transplant, barring any complications or rejection.We will keep you posted as to her progress! Right now, the doctors say she needs to gain some weight in order to bring down additional risk factors. Did you know that CFers need 5,000 calories a day just to maintain their weight? This is why we started this Go Fund Me page ~ to give her the support she needs up to and beyond transplant for at least 6  months.   Since the transplant will take place in San Diego and she currently lives in Los Angeles, she needs to rent an apartment for 3 to 6 months post transplant as well as pay her rent and living expenses until the big day comes since she is no longer able to work to support herself.  We are thrilled that lungs are on the way but she needs a community to help cover all of the endless expenses involved.  The back and forth to San Diego appointments, the hotels, her current living expenses etc.. We hope that she has inspired you with her endless positivity, sense of humor and charitable work through a non profit she founded at 13 years old, Claire's Place Foundation which ironically helps other CF children and families in the way that she herself needs now.  If you don't know Claire, please take a minute to Google  her name and see some of her videos on line and on social media as well as a beautiful episode on The CWs ""My Last Days, Season 1 "" Directed by Justin Baldoni  and Wayfarer Entertainment. ￼ CNN  has done 2 stories covering her journey for 2 years now and will continue to cover her experience pre and post lung transplant to spread awareness about the process and what people with Cystic Fibrosis go through. Even as her lungs fail, she is still willing to share her experience in the hope of helping another young adult with CF who may be considering a lung transplant. Claire was recently named Glamour Magazine's College Woman of the Year Grand Prize Winner 2018   for her work in advocacy and charity.  Behind the scenes, she struggles for breath and is currently in end stage lung disease, but that is not the face she shows the world. ￼ Please, consider making a donation today so that we can relieve the stress she is feeling about not being well enough to continue working until transplant and possibly up to a year post transplant. What would be most helpful is if  you could make a 10 - 30 second video about how you have been inspired by Claire and then share that video along with this link to your community and social media following.  I am sure with your help, we can reach and maybe even beat this goal.   https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire with hashtag #TeamClaire Thank you so much for your support!  Please do share with followers, friends and family that you feel might be inspired to support as well. Your donations will be deposited in to a private account for Claire and used to pay her rent and expenses over the next 6 to 18 months so she can simply focus on this next huge step while she is so ill.  Specifically travel money, hotels, medications, apartment rental pre transplant here in Los Angeles and post transplant in San Diego, food and other necessities for Claire.Warmly, #TeamClaire ""Truly honored to have lived, failed and accomplished in the ways I have"" ~ Claire WIneland ￼

She is a self less soul who always places the happiness of others above hers.When she got pregnant the 2nd time, we were excited as friends to see the baby boy. She got herself checked in for delivery at Stanford medical facility - Dublin the night of 16th May 2018. Its been 65 days but Ganga hasn’t returned home. Ganga went through 2 cardiac arrests, brain damage and has been in coma and a partial vegetative state past 65 days. Ganga was diagnosed with AFE (amniotic fluid embolism). A rare childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid, enters the blood stream of the mother to trigger a serious reaction. When she was awaiting delivery the night of, the amniotic fluid percolated into her system putting her heart through 2 cardiac arrests. The CPR brought her back temporarily but the fluid mixed blood had affected the brain pushing her into coma.Her husband Sriram, our dear friend has not left her side since that day. It kills him to watch the enigma of his life, lying unresponsive to the very voices that filled her life. Her little child still thinks her mom is just unwell and will come back and hug her soon, the baby boy Rithvin has not felt the touch of his dear mother till this day.At this heart wrenching moment, we would like your help to keep Ganga in the facility, so she receives the much needed treatment to recover. The family has undergone unimaginable trauma in a matter of hours and its been 65 days of suffering.Our hopes are high, she is taking baby steps of progress now, she opens her eyes, but can’t process her surrounding yet. She can hear you speak but cannot respond yet. But we are happy she has progressed thus far. We seek your help to continue the treatment and hospital care such that our Ganga returns back to us the way she was in fullness and health. Her little children have suffered enough and should be able to re-unite with their mother soon.

She had lower abdominal pain all summer long, and just before going back to finish her final year at Covenant College in Georgia, she went for a check up at her gynocologist to check for orvarian cysts. During a laproscopic procedure the cancer was discovered. After meeting several oncologists, Hanna felt strongly that she needed to pursue a natural approach to dealing with the disease. She was able to enter into the care of some of the best alternative doctors available who felt confident they could help her. And so, over the past 6 months Hanna has pursued every avenue of homeopathic treatments, traveling to doctors around the tri-state area every day of the week, sometimes two in one day. We found out two weeks ago that the the tumors in Hanna's abdomen have grown from 3 CM to 17.5 CM - and have englufed her bladder, uterus, ovaries and affected part of her liver. It was made clear to her and my family that surgery is required immediately.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:Hanna met with THE top surgeon for this type of cancer in Washington D.C. and he has an opening available to perform surgery this Thursday, March 8, 2018, before he takes a leave of absence. But, our insurance will only cover procedures within the state of New Jersey. We need to raise the funds to get this procedure done this week. We have no time to waste chasing down the insurance company. All donations will be put into the bank account of Hanna's mom - Hope, as she is sparing Hanna the financial burden as Hanna fights for her life. Throughout this entire experience, Hanna has remained steadfast and hopeful, which we credit to God and the immensely supportive community of friends and family who have come alongside her, prayed for her and sent notes of encouragement to Hanna. We recognize this is an incredible amount of money to try and raise in such a short amount of time, but her life depends on it. We believe that God is bigger than cancer, and that everything is possible through Him. So, we are hoping and believing for the impossible - and would be so grateful for anything you can do to help financially and by sharing this page.",2.7k,3.7k,14,"2,705",6 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATES|| 8/06/2018 - 1930 MST|| Jake is enjoying his recovery in Dhahran and slowly getting back to normal: spending time at the student center and getting back into a daily routine. Last weekend was a weekend of firsts. First time driving, first time in the water, and first time throwing a frisbee! || 7/17/2018 - 0149 GMT+2 || Jake had a great time watching the World Cup Final with his students at the Student Center yesterday evening. Jake continues to be active in working towards his recovery. He has been doing PT at home with his Mom and brother Caleb coaching him everyday. There have been ongoing medical appointments and things are moving in a good direction. Again, thanks for everything, ALL of the support has been nothing short of amazing!|| 7/12/2018 - 1638 MDT || Jake is continuing his recovery back in Dhahran. The main goal currently is to reduce the swelling in the residual limb and he has already seen some progress. He has been awarded a new and more suitable house form Aramco, which he appreciates very much! The move is still in progress, but a big shout out to all the people who have already lended a hand! 


The food train has been an absolute blessing and he is eating quite well! The best news of all is that his Mom (Robbin) and Caleb (his brother) have arrived to Saudi!|| 7/7/2018 - 2200 MDT || Jake is starting to feel more at home again in his community. He's very happy to be back and has enjoyed catching up with a few people and slowly getting back into a more normal routine. Aramco is in the process of finding him a more suitable living arrangement as well, something that is a single-floor. Yes, he also went back today to teach his first fitness class! Here are a few pics from him driving with a colleague to look for a new place as well as him with his fitness class. || 7/4/2018 - 1800 MDT || Jake is SUPER happy to be back in Dhahran in his community! However, the heat is NO JOKE over there and forgetting your sunglasses doesn't make it any easier on a 110+ degree day! (Pic below) He's very happy to be back in an environment where he is familiar with the medical staff that is treating him. He is also very thankful for the meal train that has been initiated for him (link:  https://www.mealtrain.com/trains/zv21gd ). More to come later and he's still not quite ready for visitors, but thinks that next week may be the week.|| 7/3/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jake has safely made it back to his community in Dhahran! It's amazing that he was able to move himself so early. He told me that it was pretty wild to think that he was undergoing surgery for the amputation of his leg less than 5 days ago, and he was now using crutches to move across the tarmac and board a plane! It took a tremendous amount of energy for him, so he is still resting quite a bit, but Jake is excited to start seeing everyone soon! Now that he is back in his home community, they have organized meals for him which he is beyond excited about! Pics to come later! || 7/2/2018 - 1400 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake earlier today and he is ON THE MOVE! He departed the hospital in Jeddah earlier today and is on the plane on the way back to Dhahran! He is SUPER excited to be back in the community and to continue this road to recovery. He asked me to share a few pictures of him on the move today. More to come soon with his updates, and I don't know when he'll be ready to start seeing visitors, but I know everyone is anxious to see him. I'll be sure to let everyone know as soon as he feels up to it. BTW - can you believe how good he already is on crutches?!?!BTW - Yes, I realize that some of the photos are sideways :) I'll eventually figure out how to get them straightened out without cropping out half of the photo! || 7/1/2018 - 1600 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake a few times today and he has a lot of positive news he would like to share! He has a few pictures to share as well. The first picture is of Jake cleaning himself up a bit, getting his hair washed and just sitting up for a while! The second is of him learning to balance himself on crutches and moving around, a LOT! The third is of him receiving his latest blood transfusion. Which, we have also received the results from, and his levels are stable enough now for a short term air travel back to the hospital in Dhahran (where he lives and his community is). He is hoping to get fly there tomorrow pending any other complications! As always, he is in great spirits despite the circumstances, and is SUPER thankful for the support. Again, huge shout out to Sarah who has not left his side and has been a tremendous advocate for Jake the last few days. Not to mention all the of support that Aramco and all of his friends/family are helping with behind the scenes .|| 7/1/2018 - 0400 MDT || ""You got to Move it Move it"" is the theme of Jake's day today! He called me (Caleb) this morning to inform me that he was moving under his own power with crutches. He was able to get out of the bed and do a little bathing (which we know both Jake and Sarah were grateful for). His energy levels are much higher today than yesterday. His body has accepted both blood transfusions that they gave him over the last 30 hours, which takes a lot of time and requires very frequent monitoring making it tough for Jake to rest. He is moving more towards stability Pics to come soon! || 6/30/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jeremy (Jakes brother) spoke with Jake this morning. We are all really impressed that he is up and moving! He was able to get out of his bed yesterday and got to start working on his balance. Jake said, ""It's a little weird, my body has a new center of gravity now"". It was a LOT of effort for him to be up and moving yesterday. Today, he has been taking a little rest from all that work, and has his focus set clearly on catching up on all the World Cup games that he's been missing! Here's a photo of Jake's current status. || 6/29/2018 - 1100 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake this morning and he is up and moving! He has been making great progress, which none of use every doubted that he would for a second. They were able to take the catheter out this morning (which Jake is thankful for) and he is starting to move around. His spirit is unbreakable and unbelievably positive. Also, he wanted to share a few photos for everyone. He also wanted to let people know he stood up under his OWN POWER using the bars that they installed. Sarah has been a rockstar as well and there with Jake supporting him and pushing him right along into the recovery! He's super thankful for everything and is doing his best to respond to messages as he has the time and energy.

|| 6/28/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake today and he is in great spirits! He managed to get some good laughs in with Jake and talked about how he is doing. Jake said that the highlight of his day was a giant bag of cherries which he devoured! He is getting his appetite back and is becoming more stable every day. He is still not in a good position to accept visitors, but we all know that with his big personality, it won't be long! All of your support is appreciated and I'm certain that all of us together are making a big difference.|| 6/28/2018 - 0800 MDT || The family spoke with Jake this morning. He is overwhelmed by all of the support and expressed his thanks for all of it. He know's its tough, but he asked for NO VISITORS at the current time. He is still very focused on the recovery and will advise the family when he is able to accept visitors. Thank you again for all of your support and understanding. || 6/27/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb (Jake's brother) spoke with Jake tonight. He's in great spirits and appreciates the overwhelming love and support from everyone. He is stable at the hospital in East Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He's been getting good rest and has someone with him 24/7. Please try not to overwhelm him as he's resting. The family will be providing accurate updates on this page.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The family is managing the online side of this GoFundMe page.

The current prognosis is that she will never walk again.Victoria retains complete mental capacity as well as the use of her head, neck and arms.

Her rare form of cancer puts her in a situation where conventional medicine cannot help her any further.She is pursuing alternate treatment at the Immunity Therapy Center near San Diego where she will start receiving the intensive, targeted treatments her body is needing now more than ever. These treatments will strengthen her immune system as well as help it to recognize the cancerous cells in order to overcome them. She is scheduled to begin on Monday, May 7th, and will be needing the funds by May 27th at the latest.  Her father, Rick Ridings, is overseeing this account, withdrawals, and payments.  On May 8th, we increased the goal to $50,000 as they have now recommended extra treatments and continuing care. This is an urgent need and any amount you are able to contribute to her life is deeply appreciated! Please share this page and spread the word for this. Thank you! For more details, see below.Read more of Esther's story on her blog: https://findingperspective.net/The BackstoryHi, I’m Esther Moore. I’m a mother, musician, a writer and blogger. I’m married to William Moore and we have a gorgeous little four year old boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. ￼￼￼￼About a year and a half after finding out Levy’s surprise diagnosis at birth, I was told at the age of 26 that my body was fighting a very aggressive, fast growing type of cancer  - triple negative breast cancer, one of the hardest to treat conventionally. I had two surgeries, an extensive one where they took out all my lymph nodes in my left arm and another when I found a second lump under my arm a few months later. ￼￼￼￼Then, I found a third lump - the third time the cancer had recurred within 9 months. At this point the doctors told me that they wouldn’t recommend surgery, because it would just keep coming back. They said that unfortunately, since it had shown to be so aggressive and recurring, any treatment they could give me like chemo and radiation would most likely only be palliative (just have a small chance of even extending my life), not curative. It was devastating to hear. After the surgeon told me it was now inoperable and that there was nothing else they could offer me that would be curative, we prayed about it and decided to move back from the UK to the place I had grown up to be near family - Jerusalem, Israel. I’ve been following an intensive natural/alternative treatment plan since the beginning that has helped a huge amount. We also have been blown away by how many people around the world have been praying for us and believing with us for total healing, that we believe has made a huge difference. Thankfully, this seemed to help delay the cancer spreading since the oncologist told me back in October 2016 that it would have spread to all my major organs within the next three months. Up until recently, it miraculously hadn’t spread at all and was still contained to the area under my arm. Where I am nowRecently, I’ve been in a lot more intense constant pain. My left arm has also become swollen, painful and unusable with symptoms of lymphedema (common after the surgery I had). We decided to go to the hospital here to see if anything could be done. After what felt like a million tests, scans and long days at the hospital, we found out the results...and they were not what we were hoping for. It showed that the cancer now had started to spread throughout my lymphatic system, and that they had also found a small mass on one of my vertebrae bones. It was so hard to hear, but we’re thankful that it hasn’t spread further and has not spread to any organs. Still, we knew something had to be done. Although this would now class it as stage four cancer, the doctors at the hospital said there was still hope. They told us there is a new cancer treatment called immunotherapy, a treatment that supercharges the immune system to fight against the cancer itself that has had incredible results - even for people with stage 4 cancer. Our next stepsAfter a lot of prayer and research and talking things through, we decided to look at clinics that specialise in this treatment. We found one near San Diego called the Immunity Therapy Center  that offers immunotherapy along with all of the intensive, non toxic treatments that I have researched and been wanting to do.  There are case studies of people who did these treatments at this Center who had stage 4, triple negative breast cancer  and had incredible results - even going home cancer free. The center combines the latest cutting edge medical treatments with holistic, natural non-toxic therapies to get the best results. From independent reviews  it looks like they have helped thousands of people, many with stage 4 cancer, to massively improve and often become cancer free. Within a couple days of finding the clinic and it being confirmed to us that this seemed to be the next step, everything miraculously fell into place faster than we could have imagined. I’ll be flying out today (!!) to start treatment this Monday, the 7th of May.  We strongly feel that this is my best chance at getting my life back and being here for our son and future children. But, we need your help. All together the costs come to 30,000 US dollars for a three week treatment. Many people in my situation have had incredible results even in these three weeks, but included in this cost is a detailed intensive home treatment plan provided by the clinic for at least three months afterwards as well. We’re so thankful for the incredible support network we’ve had around us from the beginning from all over the world, and appreciate anything you can do to help us meet our goal by donating and/or sharing this page.

With dedication and hard work, while training in Antigua, Greg landed a full-time, professional crew position on a sailing yacht. Greg’s dream became a reality and he was excited to begin his worldwide adventure traveling and working on the vessel.While anchored off the island of Grenada, Greg was enjoying a relaxing day with his crew at the waterfalls when the accident happened. Severe damage was done to his spine along with fractures of his right foot and ankle. Thanks to a very gifted Cuban trained Neuro surgeon, (Dr. Nillo Alveraz, age 28), Greg's fractured back was fortunately stabilized enough to be quickly airlifted back to the United States. Upon arrival in Florida, Greg's back was permanently repaired and stabilized. Then, efforts turned to multiple surgical attempts to repair the compound fractures and soft tissue damage to his right foot and ankle. However, to give Greg the best hope to ultimately enjoy a pain free and active life, it was necessary to amputate Greg’s right foot below the knee. Greg’s dream came to a halt and his future life became altered. But, with Greg’s character there is absolutely no doubt hope and courage will prevail. He has always stepped up to any challenge placed in his path.Greg is now on his new road to recovery assisted with the loving support of his doctors, family and friends.  Insurance will cover many of his medical costs but not all. Most importantly, he will require access to the best available services and prostheses for him to live his life to its full potential.  I'm certain all those who have known, loved and admire Greg will want this for him too. The cost of prosthetics will be significant and an ongoing financial burden. So please, let us all consider “stepping up” for Greg. Please do donate to Greg's recovery as he deserves the best doctors, therapy services, and most importantly, prostheses out there to achieve a full recovery and regain his healthy, active lifestyle once again.No donation is too small. Let’s work together to make sure Greg is given the means to ensure full recovery.  Our contributions are perhaps “one small step” for us and “one giant leap” forward for Greg. We love you Greg-you got this!*For those wondering, Greg's father, Ed Strauss is listed as the main beneficiary of this campaign. This means all your donations will go directly to Greg through his parents. We thank you all for your love, support, and donations!",1.1k,2.4k,12,"1,157",4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We felt we needed to start something to help alleviate any financial stress so the Duncan family and James’s partner, Colleen Maxwell can focus on treatment and healing. Colleen has been part of James's life since high school, and will continue to be by his side and care for James and his children. The money donated will be used to pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance and to help with daily living expenses. James has a long road ahead of him, but we know James has the strength, determination, and faith to recover to his fullest extent. Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers and thank you for your support. Your thoughts, prayers, generous donations and resources to help him heal are sincerely appreciated. ￼",785,1.6k,3,767,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

When they discovered that wasn’t possible, both were undeterred. The Rogers felt there was room in their home and hearts for adopted children. Their first, a newborn daughter, was adopted from a broken home in 1989. The second, a 12 year-old Russian boy adopted in2005.The Rogers entered Jaiden’s life not a moment too soon. After his birth mom signed over guardianship, Tim and Natalie were finally directed to remote residence in Georgia. When they walked in ‘the smell was overwhelming.’ They found a little boy with fetal alcohol syndrome, neglected and malnourished, huddled next to his filthy car seat. He was even once observed eating dog food out of a dog dish because he hadn’t been fed.For the first year they had Jaiden, he used to sneak into the Roger’s bedroom in the middle of the night and feel their faces to make sure they were still there, then go back to bed. What neither Jaiden nor his new family could have known then was the only thing more horrifying than the first chapter of Jaiden’s life would be the second chapter.The trouble began innocently enough 6 years ago when Tim noticed a small lump on Jaiden’s right thigh just underneath his skin. He took Jaiden to a dermatologist who told them to keep an eye on it. The lump started getting bigger. Even more startling, the lump had started to spread…. fast.“It was as if the skin on his right leg was an 1/8 of an inch thick with something very hard underneath, like stone. It felt like tapping on a countertop.”In a matter of weeks, the growth had wrapped around Jaiden’s right thigh and behind his knee. Once the hard calcifications invaded the joint, Jaiden began to lose mobility. The family rushed to Texas Tech Medical Center for a biopsy.When the results came back, even the doctors couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Jaiden was diagnosed with something called Stiff Skin Syndrome. Jaiden is the 41st documented case ever in the world, and the only one in the world righ now, as far as we know.Stiff Skin Syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by hard, thick skin, which can spread over the entire body, causing immobility. Muscles become weak, and the pain is unbearable!Jaiden’s doctors acknowledged that, they’d never seen such aggressive spread of the syndrome. In a month, it spread to Jaiden’s left leg, both hips, buttocks, and his arms. Spots have recently appeared near his spine. The once-hyperactive Jaiden is often confined to a wheelchair and no longer able to attend school with his friends.  Every day the pain from the disorder grows worse. Jaiden is the first to point out new, hard spots of skin. Jaiden understands that he is sick as much as a 12 year old boy can, although he cannot fully grasp the intent of the sinister syndrome branching out just beneath his skin.JAIDEN IS SLOWLY TURNING TO STONE!Over the last few years, the fight back has begun. Jaiden’s treatment started with rounds of chemotherapy to try to halt the spread of the calcifications. The chemo destroys both good and bad cells, leaving Jaiden weak and open to infection. He wears a medical mask to prevent infections or viruses he would not be able to fend off due to his weakened immune system.Jaiden has also started physical therapy. This is the most crucial component of his treatment. His muscles must be stretched to keep his joints limber. The stretching is immensely painful. Still, Jaiden smiles and jokes with his doctors. Jaiden submits to therapy 3 times/week. Ideally, he should be in therapy 6 times per week but the co-pays are too costly for the Rogers family.Because there are so few recorded cases, nobody knows what the worst case scenario is here. As aggressive as Jaiden’s calcifications are spreading it’s likely the disorder will spread until Jaiden experiences total paralysis. Jaiden will become entombed inside himself.  Jaiden takes 10 medications a day including a chemo medication and 4 different heavy duty pain medications.WE CAN NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!Jaiden’s stiff skin has now started to restrict his lungs and he now requires oxygen and a resperator to help him breathe .  As his chemo continues to help slow the progression of his stiff skin, it is starting to spread at a faster rate.  We have exhausted all help in the United States, costing  the Rogers over $500,000 of there own retirement money and they have also mortgaged their house. We are now left with one last hope for Jaiden , AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. We absolutely need to get him to Europe to try a special stem cell treatment specifically for rare skin diseases.  Without this treatment Jaiden’s Skin will continue to harden and and he will start to deteriorate.  We are unsure about what will start happening to his other organs.  THE COST OF THIS TREATMENT AND THE COST TO STAY INEUROPE FOR A YEAR WILL COST ROUGHLY $1.5 million.  The Rogers are asking people to donate what they can.  WE CAN NOT DO THIS WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR HELP!!  IIF WE CANT RAISE THE MONEY TO SAVE JAIDEN , WE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING TO DO FOR HIM..  We are also asking if you have hotel points or flyer points that you are willing to donate, please let them know.Jaiden is a survivor. The first two years of his life he endured hardships no child should suffer. The lasting effects of which are imprinted so deeply he would sneak into his new family’s bedroom just to make sure somebody was there. Today, we’re all there for Jaiden.Jaiden has been seen on the daytime tv The Doctors, Goog morning America, channel 5 news out of Colorado Springs, channels 4,9 and Fox News out of Denver and also newspapers all over the world trying to find a cure.The Rogers are currently working with Dr. Elizabeth Swanson with Childrens Hospital and Dr. Hal Dietz at John Hopkins University, Baltimore. https://people.com/human-interest/12-year-old-boy-disease-stone-entombed-within-himself/",2.4k,2.6k,17,"2,435",4 months,1 month ago,4 months,2018-09-03
Medical,3,Save Kenneth Young,https://www.gofundme.com/savekennethyoung,"HILLSDALE, NY","March 10, 2018","$95,000","$134,775","Nightmare in PanamaMy Father, Kenneth Young, is fighting for his life in Panama. Dad has bacterial meningitis and a collapsed lung, and is under intensive care at Clínica Hospital San Fernando, Panama City.Although Dad has medical insurance back home, it doesn’t cover out of country treatment and we have been relying on his travelers insurance, which just ran out. The hospital is demanding payment up-front before further treatment.We desperately need your help to keep him alive long enough to recover to the point where he can be transported back home.Keep Kenneth AliveBecause he is a foreigner, the hospital requires money up front, and they require a large amount. Initially they required a $20,000 deposit and we were able to scramble for the cash as well as raise our credit limit an additional $15,000. However, intensive care is incredibly expensive. Some examples: to remain in intensive care costs $800 a day. To “adjust the respirator” costs $50 each time which is done many times a day. The doctors charge thousands every day and procedures such as X-rays and CT scans are also expensive. We are tapped out financially and need your help. Please give whatever you can so that my sister Esther can have her father at her graduation this spring. So that my little brother Evan, who has down syndrome and only knows that his dad is sick, and all his friends and family can see him again.My Dad's StoryMy dad Kenneth and mom Irene had been planning this trip for years. My mom has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we thought that the combination of warm weather, affordable living and family friends would make Panama an ideal place to retire to. One of my dad’s best friends is originally from Panama, and my parents have been planning a scouting vacation to see if Panama would work. For as long as I remember, my dad has worked incredibly hard for my family, when my mother developed her condition my father somehow managed to balance between working even harder and being the best husband and father my entire family could ever have hoped for. The hideous irony here, is that what was supposed to have been a well deserved trip to prepare for a sustainable retirement has turned into a nightmare for our whole family that is devouring the very retirement funds that my parents were trying to save.Shortly before the trip, both my parents came down with the flu, despite making sure they got vaccinated. They were both feeling better in time for the flight but (according to the doctors) my father likely developed a secondary ear infection he was not aware of. As the plane descended for the landing Kenneth’s eardrum burst. Shortly after, Dad began complaining of pain, developed a fever and became disoriented. He was brought to a local clinic where they administered antibiotics, but this was not enough. He was brought to a hospital where they informed my mother that the infection had moved from his ear to inside his skull and that he had meningitis. Since then it has been a constant battle. Doctors put him in an induced coma and performed surgery to physically remove as much of the infection as possible. Although the antibiotics seemed to be mostly working, the seriousness of his infection meant it would not be an easy recovery under the best of circumstances. Unfortunately, there have been additional complications as one of his lungs has partially collapsed. This all means that, although his travel insurance will pay for emergency medical air transport, he is in too serious a condition to transport at this time. I have dropped everything to fly down to Panama with my sister Esther so I can help my mother and be with my father. My mother and I are currently staying in a cheap airbnb near the hospital. The cost of living in Panama City is surprisingly, not that much cheaper than back home, but we doing everything we can to be as extremely economical as possible. 
A message from my mom, Irene.""We are so fortunate to have close family and friends who are helping out with our son, Evan, at home. Evan has Down Syndrome and requires help with day-to-day living. Our daughter, Esther, graduates college on May 7th. It would be a wonderful miracle if she could have her father there with her. It would be the best graduation present ever. Out eldest son, Luke, will stay down here for a couple of weeks to help support me. Esther returns home to finish out her semester. I am so grateful for all the loving support we have received so far. The emotions on that end are overwhelming and fill my heart with love. Please consider donating whatever you can to help keep Kenneth alive and for me to stay here with him. I want Kenneth to come home also for Evan, who only knows that his father is sick. Evan is desperate to see Kenneth again. Please share our story with your Facebook friends, too. Thank you for taking the time to read about what has happened to Kenneth. Obviously this turn of events will have a profound effect on Kenneth’s future, the future of our family, and the greater community as well. We wish you well, and are grateful beyond words for the outpouring of sympathy and concern we have already received.""",612,1.6k,75,608,5 months,4 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

They have brought some semblance of comfort to our family during an impossibly difficult time. We are especially grateful for the funds being raised for Cory and Maran’s boys: Brycen, Benton, and Braedan. Our hearts ache knowing that Maran’s sons will grow up without their incredible Mom. As many of you know, shortly after bringing Braedan into this world, Maran suffered a catastrophic bleed in her brain from a suspected AVM. Despite her medical team’s best efforts and timely care, we eventually learned that her injury was so significant that there was no chance of recovery. Maran’s wish was to have her organs donated, should a terrible situation like this ever come to be. We have honoured this wish, and know that in passing, Maran has continued to do what she did best – take care of others. There is still much work to be done to support her husband and three sons, including a newborn baby. Your contributions to this campaign have helped us to feel that Maran’s beautiful young family will be well cared-for, despite her untimely death. Maran was, simply put, a wonderful person. This page is a testament to the many lives she has touched in both her work and personal life. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support.

Medical,3,Jeremiah's Battle For His Life,https://www.gofundme.com/ccu35y-help-with-financial-burdens,"METAIRIE, LA","April 4, 2018","$250,000","$132,709","Jeremiah’s Battle for His Life“Definitely the underdog here,” was how Jeremiah’s oncologist described his cancer. “Got to fight harder.” Preliminary pathology suggests that Jeremiah’s cancer is Osteoblastic Osteosarcoma, a bone cancer resistant to radiation.Jeremiah (16) is used to being the underdog. He suffered the loss of his mother to cancer when a little boy. His father is in fulltime ministry to abolish abortion, so financial struggles were a normal part of growing up. He’s from a large homeschooling family of thirteen brothers and sisters. The youngest of five brothers who all played football, Jeremiah learned to fight. Years of losing on the football field trained him to fight hard. His hard work paid off. He is an all-star, state champion. But it was his love for Jesus and the family ministry to abolish abortion that taught him to fight harder. Now he’s in the battle for his life. In July 2017, Jeremiah rededicated his life to Christ and was baptized at an Operation Save America ministry event in Louisville, Kentucky. In March 2018 he was diagnosed with cancer. The MRI revealed two tumors on Jeremiah’s spine, between zones T6 and T7. Picture a pair of hands pressing together, crushing his nerve endings. These tumors are in addition to the one in his chest. Without surgery, the tumors will cause Jeremiah to be permanently paralyzed from the waist down. With surgery, there is a still risk of paralysis because of the location of the tumors. He can also lose the ability to go to the bathroom normally. Finally, following a successful surgery there is no guarantee that Jeremiah will regain the mobility he’s lost. According to the neurosurgeon this type of surgery has a range of outcomes. Some patients regain the former use of their legs. Others do not. The goal of the surgery is to stop further paralysis.Following the surgery, Jeremiah will then face the monster of cancer. He has a tumor in his chest and two spots on his lungs. Jeremiah is in severe pain, without proper medication. His pain radiates down his back and around his side, so he cannot lie on his back or turn to the side. With the tumor in his chest, he cannot lie on his stomach. Often the only relief he finds is standing- but with the tumors in his back causing paralysis that is no longer possible.But as Jeremiah’s father, Rusty explained to the oncologist, “With God all things are possible.” Jeremiah’s bone cancer is aggressive. Whereas the tumor is his chest was a barely noticeable under his skin, it is now the size of an lemon that can be cupped in a hand. Its growth seems to have happened almost overnight; Jeremiah’s pain is growing too, radiating throughout his body. Jeremiah is a brave young man. There is no anger, self-pity or a woes is me attitude . He is more concerned about how others are feeling. When he sees his mother’s concern, he forces a smile or winks. When he sees a worried friend, he stops what he’s doing to pray for them. He posts daily Scripture verse to encourage those who are praying for him and who are following his story on social media. Jeremiah posted this prayer on Facebook:I don’t deserve Your healing but Lord You will always deserve my praise. Through death or life, may Your great name be lifted up and everything that is of me fall to the waste side. Oh Lord, strengthen me that I may fight the battle with a courage Satan cannot tamper with. If You take me home or leave me here to fight a little longer, may it be Your breath in my lungs and Your song on my tongue. Lord I consecrate myself to the full advancement of the Kingdom of God! Lord, I love You and I can’t wait to see You face to face. Amen.As you can imagine, fighting this battle is taking resources the family doesn’t have. Your love, prayers, and support are greatly appreciated.Matthew 19:26 reads, ""Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible'.”The Thomas nation’s stand is simply, they are entrusting the life of their son to the Lord. They believe for a miracle. But even if, that does not take place, they want everyone to know, their faith in Jesus Christ is not for sale and non-negotiable.

Upon being rushed to the hospital via ambulance to Lascolinas Medical city and then they asked to join in Plano Medical city, they discovered tumor in her brain. After doing an initial CT scan and finding a massive mask, apart from her fluctuating levels of sugar, sodium and potassium; they performed an MRI and found a tumor between her brain and skull and in between the optic nerves, which was removed after 2 surgeries, one performed through nose and other through open brain surgery and there is still considerable amount of tumor.While we are praying for the best possible scenario to be that the doctors can remove all the tumor, there is a chance that if it is unable to be completely removed because of the location, my mom will need to undergo radiation.My brother also had to drop his course, as my mom needs good care and support (and his course fee is due still of around 8000$).It's already been around 90 days of her suffering in hospital while she is being treated for her brain tumor and mask, suddenly she got to suffer from Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), as she got infected from E. coli bacteria due to high dosage of antibiotics which is a serious addressable condition which leads to sudden drop of blood platelets and slowly effects the other body parts. It's a very rare case and the doctors suggested that the only way to increase her blood platelets is to give her the course of HUS medicine for a year-long from now which is 1 sitting per month which costs around 25,000$/sitting, and “not at all being covered by insurance”.

This beautiful little soul was born on April 24 to her absolutely amazing parents Harry (Hürrem)  and Parla.Ergan Family , We love them! They are the kindest people you will meet.Sienna was born with an extremely rare case of Extreme Congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Only 20 cases have been seen around the world with this severity. On top of that she also has another heart condition called AV Heart Block causing fast and chaotic heartbeats. These rapid heartbeats might trigger a sudden fainting spell or seizure, and in some cases it can beat erratically for so long that it can cause sudden death.Only three hours after she was born, she was transferred to the NICU where she decompensated quickly with suspension of breathing (apnea) and bradycardia.  She was emergency intubated and CPR was initiated. Within hours, she had gone through her first heart surgery and received a pacemaker. She has been sedated and paralyzed since Day 1. She is still at Pediatric Cardio-Thoracic ICU showing the world how strong she is. During this last month, unfortunately her heart stopped pumping two more times (cardiac arrests) but Sienna has the strongest will to live and with your prayers and support still continues her fight.Since her condition is so rare, doctors do not have a lot of prior cases by which to understand the exact course of action and therefore have to take things day by day. They continue to monitor, treat, and work tirelessly in the hopes that she can survive and grow to a point where her heart is more stable. If you are a parent, or even if you are not, you can try to imagine the dark times that her loving parents who just gave her life are going through.  Sienna is hospitalized at UCLA, and her strong and amazing young parents are not leaving her bedside. No one is really thinking about the financial sacrifice, the medical bills which will reach millions of dollars in desperately trying to save this little angel's life. All the energy is focused on keeping her stable so she can join us all here on earth. There is no price for that. Both parents have left everything aside and therefore are not earning any income during this critical time. Money alone is not what will save Sienna but it will sure help the family and reduce some of the obvious stress they are facing.As a parent myself, trying to keep calm just watching my kid scrape his knee while playing, I can not even imagine the strength her parents need to manage while going through this horrible time.Please, Please, Please help with whatever you can give here. Remember, its just money, it means Absolutely Nothing when it comes to life.  Sienna's middle name, Alexa, means strong defender. Let's help her wake up and smile. She will appreciate every single one of you for helping her survive, and she deserves to.They have identified the top pediatric cardiologists in the world who have done so much for her already, who can broaden her treatment with Advanced Genetic Studies and save her life but we need your help. Just as a quick final note, when I started this campaign the Ergan family did not know I started this campaign for them. It could be embarrassing to ask for help and I did not discuss this with them prior as I knew they would say no, but I can assure you that they can use all the help they can get, and this is a chance for each and every one of you to make a positive impact on their lives and help Sienna go through this.THANK YOU AND PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!Shai Ash￼",930,7.4k,10,996,3 months,12 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She had a persistent cough and began feeling weak and tired after any physical exertion.

She finally went to the doctor’s office where they performed a chest x-ray that showed fluid on her lungs, leading them to believe she had pneumonia. That news finally convinced her to stay home sick from work. Over the next two days her condition grew dramatically worse. The Doctor finally ordered her in for a CT scan which lead to an echocardiogram, which lead to her being admitted to the emergency room in Anchorage on Friday May 18th. The doctors informed us that her heart was only functioning at 10% efficiency, and the fluid in her lungs and swelling in her abdomen were actually an edema caused by her weak heart not being able to pump fluids properly.  After spending two days in the cardiac intensive care unit where more testing was conducted, the Anchorage cardiologists told us they had ordered an emergency medevac from Anchorage to the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. Two hours later we were in a jet headed South. Upon arriving at UWMC they ran every test under the sun and declared there is no real chance that her heart is going to heal on its own. They took her into surgery and installed a temporary heart pump to keep her other organs from shutting down while they figure out a way forward. Today the lead cardiac doctor informed us that she will have to have a more permanent pump installed and she will be placed on the heart transplant list. She is currently at the top of the list based on how sick her heart is, but because she has type O blood, she can only accept other type O hearts. They gave us an estimated wait of six months to a year to find a suitable heart, but also said there’s really just no way to know how long it could take. One could become available tonight. Either way, the road ahead is going to be exceedingly difficult for Kristin and our entire family. We will have to sell our home in Eagle River and relocate close to Seattle so that we can be close to the hospital if a heart becomes available, or if something goes wrong with the battery operated heart pump she will be wearing every second of every day until the donor heart arrives. She will not be able to continue working, but hopefully I can get a transfer to Renton, SeaTac, or some other airport in the area.  This brings me to the bush I’ve been trying to beat around. We simply can not afford all of the costs we are about to accrue. I have no idea how much of this million dollar (I wish I was exaggerating) procedure will be covered by our insurance, but I am certain that they will not cover the cost of us having to relocate to Seattle, and with Kristin not being able to work for the foreseeable future, we are officially living outside our means. Just before we left Anchorage, the head cardiac nurse came in the room and gave us a talk about what we should expect. One thing she hit on several times was that we had to start a crowd fund as soon as possible, because not even the best insurance covers all the unforeseen costs associated with a heart transplant and the life changes that follow. Several other people who we love and respect told us the same, so I’m taking their advice. I’m coming with my hat in my hand, more afraid than I’ve ever been of anything in my life. I made this page on the advice a woman who’s seen many families suffer from the monetary burden of heart transplant surgery and the subsequent treatment. I feel embarrassed and ashamed to even ask for money, but if it gives my wife a better shot at living a happy, healthy life, I will do whatever it takes. If you can spare a couple bucks, we would be more grateful than I can possibly ever tell you. If not, we completely understand. Please just keep my Beautiful Wife in your thoughts and prayers.

The incident occurred on the north ridge of Mount Conness, where Adrien was climbing at around 11,400 feet, near the base of the Conness Glacier. He was scrambling up a talus field to the base of the climbing route when a large rock, weighing around 4,000 pounds, gave way and pinned his leg against a boulder below.Thanks to the efforts of two hikers who were nearby, the Mono County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue were able to locate Adrien, and after some difficulty launching their own helicopter due to heavy smoke in the area, they were able to free Adrien and evacuate him, with the help of a National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk that was close by on fire assignment.When Adrien arrived at the Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, he was in critical condition, but thanks to the hospital's medical staff, and the quick thinking of the hikers who first reported his location, his life was saved. Tragically, they had no choice but to amputate his right leg above the knee.Everyone at Hagens Berman Axeon is deeply saddened by the news and our thoughts and prayers are with Adrien's family and friends at this difficult time.We have set up this page to help with medical expenses and are asking the cycling community to join our efforts.

From all of us working on jim's recovery support team thank you so much for all of your generosity, shares and prayers. We knew we could raise this money but we are all awed that we were able to raise it this quickly. We thoughtfully came up with our goal amount by discussing future anticipated costs with Stephanie. We did our best to come up with an accurate monetary reflection of what recover would look like for jim and his family. However the reality is we don't exactly know what is in store. We know medical costs will be high and we know there will be an extensive recovery time when jim won't be working. Now that we have raised our goal, let's continue to show the McDonald family our love and support with our continued donations, shares, and prayers. Thank you! Thank you!__________________________________________________Friends, family and wider community, we reach out today with an urgent call for help. Our dear friend, jim mcdonald had a massive heart attack on May 25th while he was traveling in Scotland. A well-hidden flaw in a heart we all know to be a source of joy, love and compassion finally made itself known. In addition to the heart attack he developed a serious complication that resulted in emergency surgery. He is currently in critical but stable condition, is under sedation, and while he is expected to make a full recovery, the journey there will be long. Stephanie and the kids are on their way to Scotland to be with jim now, and are expecting to be there for up to 6 weeks, until jim is allowed to travel home. A heart attack is always a serious and life-threatening emergency, when it happens thousands of miles away, in a foreign country, the difficulties and costs faced by the family multiply infinitely. jim is a husband, and father of three, who supports his family through teaching. We’re asking today for your help in supporting jim, and his family, through this enormously hard moment in time. We need help paying for travel for his wife, Stephanie and their three children. We need your help paying for their time in Scotland during jim’s convalescence. We need help paying for jim’s surgery and recovery time in the hospital. And finally, as Jim begins his recovery, we need your help filling in the gaps that the loss of several months income will mean for his family. It’s a big ask; but if not his community, and his friends, who else? To help keep the McDonalds afloat in this storm is going to take all of us, pitching in, how and where we can. The first, best and most direct help you can give, is through this GoFundme effort. Literally every dollar counts. If jim’s teaching, his herbs, his goodness, his questionable wit, and undeniable enthusiasm has ever touched you, please consider taking this time to show that love back in his time of need. Please share this GoFundMe far and wide: 5 dollars from a stranger matters. 10 bucks from one of your coworkers makes a difference. And finally, in whatever version of prayer you practice, please hold jim and his family in your hearts. Keep the good intentions and healing love flowing so that we can have him back to talking about prog rock soon.We are all so lucky to be a part of jim’s community, be it local or extended around the world. This is our chance to do something together, to rally and support them, so that jim and his family can heal.With our deepest gratitude, jim's recovery support team.............................................................................(also, jim is a very popular man— please understand that Stephanie is overwhelmed, and is asking for privacy so that she can focus on her family.

Medical,4,Help Blanca beat cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/helpblancamorell,"BOSTON, MA","May 2, 2018","$50,000","$120,888","Hello all, My name is Begoña Morell and I am from Madrid, Spain. My sister Blanca Morell has been diagnosed with a very rare kind of cancer and would like to share her story with you. Any donations will go directly to help our parents pay for the medical expenses of her illness.We appreciate your support, prayers, and caring messages more than you can imagine. We would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.————Here is what Blanca would like to transmit to you: My name is Blanca Morell, I am 22 years old, I live in Madrid, Spain, and I have been diagnosed with cancer. I have a type of cancer in my spinal cord called Diffuse Anaplastic Astrocytoma, grade III. It is a very, very unusual cancer, as it is commonly developed by elderly people in the brain, not by young people in the spinal cord. Since it is located in my spinal cord (the part of the nervous system that transmits all of the signals to my extremities) it cannot be operated on, and when treated with radiation or chemotherapy, there is a risk that I will become quadriplegic. Being an atypical cancer, where the nervous system cells degenerate and mutate into fast-growing malignant cells, there is not a definitive treatment or solution. In this type of cancer the malignant cells mix with healthy cells along the entire spinal cord, making it very difficult to eliminate it without damaging the healthy cells.I have already lost sensitivity in my feet and legs, I don't feel anything below my chest, and I cannot walk due to a surgery I went through to be able to do a biopsy, so I must now move in a wheelchair. One of the few treatment options that can be used to fight this cancer is Proton (Radiation) Therapy. It is a very complex and expensive treatment that requires special facilities that cannot be found in Spain, and only exist in very few places in the U.S. and in Europe.Thanks to the love of my parents and their sacrifices, we have moved to Boston so that I can be treated in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where Proton Therapy is available and where there are some of only a few professionals in the world with experience in treating this cancer.The treatment consists on 42 sessions, and costs $300,000 which my parents must pay out of pocket (since neither public nor private insurances in Spain cover these treatments). In addition, there are other expenses such as appointments with my neuro-oncologist and radiotherapist, MRIs, CT simulations, etc. that raise the cost to over $400,000.  Additionally, we need to rent an apartment in Boston for the two months that I must stay for my treatment. I would like to collect funds to help my parents pay for the medical costs of my illness. Thank you so much for your donations and continued support. May God repay you",1.1k,2.3k,2,"1,117",4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Randy was diagnosed with an aggressive sarcoma cancer in his right leg in March 2017, and stopped working as a doctor at that time. Over the last 13 months Randy has undergone 6 different surgeries, had to be admitted for hospitalization on 6 other occasions, he has seen his sarcoma metastasize into his lungs so that he now has Stage 4 cancer, and he has had countless numbers of doctors appointments, treatments (chemo, immunotherapy, hydration, etc.), scans, therapies, etc.Randy's last surgery in January required him to have a complete amputation of his right leg and half of his pelvis as the only option to deal with the sarcoma that could not be controlled otherwise. That procedure alone required Randy to spend a month hospitalized and rehabbing. Fortunately, Randy is feeling better now that the sarcoma was fully removed with his leg, and his lung tumors are decreasing with continued immunotherapy.However, the only path for Randy to regain some normalcy and to be able to go back to work as a leading facial plastic surgeon in the Baltimore area...is to get a prosthetic leg which comes with a $20K copayment that Randy and his family are responsible for.Based on the costs of this prosthetic, and the significant expenses that have accumulated with all of Randy's procedures/appointments described above...Randy and his family are in significant debt and need as much financial assistance as possible. The goal of this fundraising ($50K)...if met...will cover a portion of their expenses incurred so far, and will provide a huge help to Randy and his family (his wife Marisa and two sons - Enzo and Leo).Randy is a private and proud individual, which is why many of you who know Randy are hearing about this for the first time. He had hoped to be able to handle this on his own, but this nefarious cancer he has been fighting for over 13 months now...has proven to be too much financially for Randy and his family to handle on their own. And, they need our collective help to manage the financial obligation of everything that the family has endured so far and continues to deal with.Randy has spent years and countless hours studying to become a renowned Facial Plastic Surgeon so that he could dedicate his professional life to helping hundreds if not thousands of people live a better life. Randy has volunteered his time and services on two separate occasions to go to Mexico and Nicaragua to perform cleft lip and cleft palate repairs, and fix nose and ear birth defects on children who couldn't afford the medical procedures. Randy is also a co-founder and co-director of the Greater Baltimore Cleft Lip & Palate Team, which is a group of providers that performs pro-bono services to Maryland kids with birth defects affecting their face. For those who have never had the pleasure to meet Randy, you would be hard-pressed to meet a friendlier and more caring person. It’s cliché, but Randy “would absolutely” give you the shirt off his back if you needed it and he just met you. Therefore, it is no surprise that Randy persevered to develop the medical skills and expertise to help and make a positive difference in the lives of his patients dealing with various types of facial traumas, defects, reconstructions, etc.Therefore, please consider making a donation to allow him to get the prosthetic leg that he needs to get back to work, to help his family manage the significant debt accumulated from his battle with cancer, and to let Randy do what he does best...make a positive difference in the lives of his patients and everyone he meets.A donation of any kind will be greatly appreciated and a huge help. Also, please feel free to forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in supporting the Capone family cause.Please use the contact information on the page If you have any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of this effort to help Randy and his family.",585,764,14,520,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

On May 23, Jim received a call that his potassium levels were dangerously low, and he should make his way to the ER immediately. Jim was admitted that evening, and since he had not had much of an appetite for a couple weeks, an endoscopy was performed on May 25. The GI doctor biopsied Jim's stomach and told Jim and Mary he was 'very concerned' with what he saw. Given it was Memorial Day weekend, results would take several days to return. Jim went home on Sunday, May 27, knowing he and Mary just had to wait for the results. On Tuesday, May 29, Jim was back in the ER. His legs were cramping, and he felt very tired. Low potassium was the culprit again. And Jim was admitted....again. Finally, on Thursday, May 31, the pathology returned, and cancer of the stomach was confirmed. Jim was released from the hospital on Friday morning. Mary was on the phone with Sloan Kettering throughout the day. They would have to wait until early the following week to hear confirmation of an appointment.On Monday, June 4, Jim really was not feeling well. Eating continued to be a challenge, and he was growing weaker. Mary took him back to the hospital and he was admitted....again. Early Tuesday morning, Sloan Kettering called with an appointment for the upcoming Friday. Yaay! Finally some good news! But Jim had had a rough night, and he continued to decline. Tuesday afternoon, Jim was transported to Vassar Hospital, and there, Jim and Mary received devastating news: Stage 4, diffuse gastric cancer with carcinomatosis to the abdomen. The cancer in Jim's stomach had spread into his abdomen and around his intestines. Absolutely devastating news.Mary and Jim are the best people I know. They give of themselves continuously to anyone in need or any cause - big or small. 'No' is a word they rarely say, and they never ask for anything in return. Now, they really need our help.Jim, Mary, and their four children are facing a frightening diagnosis and are in the midst of a very tough battle. Uncovered medical expenses, regular bills, and daily needs all are looming. Jim is unable to work. And Mary's focus is on Jim and their children, which is exactly where it needs to be. The support and concern of the community have been overwhelming. Mary and Jim are so very moved and appreciative. Many people have asked how they can help. Along with love and prayers, financial support is the best way to help the Hares right now. I ask you to consider a donation at this very difficult time.

Unconscious, she was rushed to Evanston Hospital where doctors identified over 10 cranial fractures. They measured the severity of her comatose state as 3-4 on the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and at one point were not positive on her ever regaining consciousness.Winnie bravely underwent 4 craniotomies and 3 assisted surgeries, fighting through and waking up from her coma on May 4, 2017.The accident resulted in devastating injuries to her brain, causing her to lose her language capabilities and control over the right side of her body. But what adversity was not able to take was her hope, her grit and her courage. She began rehab immediately. She had to learn to sit and walk again through physical therapy. She slowly regained her memory. She initially could only speak her native dialect 2 months post-coma, then slowly learned to speak mandarin again. She re-learned English. Slowly, but surely, she learned to use her left hand to write. When she couldn’t remember simple words, she just kept writing, writing and writing…Winnie’s progress has been miraculously encouraging, but she still has a long way to go before being able to be function independently. Seemingly routine tasks, such as dressing herself, are a struggle because of her paralyzed right side. Her parents left their jobs in China and flew 16 hours around the world to take care of their only child. They have depleted their savings over the last year and are now at a crossroads.As we come together as a Kellogg family, we remember our conversations with Winnie. She spoke of her beginnings growing up in China, her journeys living and working in Hong Kong and her dreams after attending Kellogg. Winnie's tragic experience hits especially close to home - it could have been any one of us crossing Clark Street that day after class. Winnie at KWEST (Kellogg Worldwide Experiences & Service Trips), August 2016We need your help to support Winnie’s medical expenses in the next year so that her dreams post-Kellogg is a detour and not a dead end. Our campaign goal is $100,000. This will be used in the following ways: － Return tickets to China for the family (estimated at $5,000)－ Rehab treatments in China from July to September 2018 (estimated at $15,000) － Rehab treatments in MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center from October 2018 to August 2019 (estimated at $80,000)Thank you for reading Winnie’s story. We appreciate any help or contribution, no matter how big or small! If possible, please share our campaign link on social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and with your friends. We will keep you posted on the use of funds and her progress going forward.  Any questions, please contact helpwinnieyang@hotmail.com.Lastly, we will end with Winnie’s favourite essay, which she took an hour to copy with her left hand: Hope.Message from Winnie's Parents:

Message from Winnie:

FAQ:Who are we and where are we from?This campaign is led by JJ Luo, Li Qiao, Taylor Chen and Michelle Guo, with the help of a group of Winnie's friends at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. We are raising the fund on behalf of Winnie and her family.Why is fundraising for Winnie necessary now?Winnie’s medical expenses were covered mostly by her student health insurance (with copay) from March, 2017 until now. However, Winnie’s health insurance will end as we graduate this summer, 2018. Her current conditions still require rigorous therapies. She’s unable to complete simple everyday tasks due to the paralysis of her right side. Her energy level tends to run low. Her languages capabilities are improving but still not fluent to communicate effectively in daily life. She and her family were initially hopeful about the legal claims. Unfortunately, she will only receive approximately $60,000 from the accident lawsuit (total amount to be determined in the next 1-2 months). She has no health insurance in China. Over the past 16 months, her parents have exhausted their savings and had to borrow money from friends and family to take care of Winnie in the U.S.. Because Winnie requires full-time care, her parents are unable to work and have no income. Her parents are also having health issues. Very recently, her mom had to take out a loan to undergo an emergent gallstone surgery because she had no health insurance in US. Why does Winnie have to leave the U.S.?Winnie’s student visa status, and health insurance in the U.S. will end this summer. While she’d like to continue to rehab in the U.S., she has to return to China at the end of June.How has Winnie progressed since she got out of her coma?When first waking up from her coma, Winnie recognized no one. She was unable to balance herself sitting up, or speak.She slowly regained her memory. She initially could only speak her native dialect 2 months post-coma, then slowly learned to speak mandarin again. She also re-learnt English. She had to learn to sit and walk again through physical therapy. Now, she can walk with crutches and use her left hand to write and type.Her cognitive progress is promising too. For example, she improved from doing only 1 GMAT question per hour to completing 10 questions per hour in merely a few months.Prior to April 2018, she rehab 5 times a week. Since this May, it was cut to 3 times due to her encouraging progress.What is Winnie’s current condition and daily schedules?After one full year of rehab, Winnie has exceeded her doctor’s expectations. She can now walk with a crutch, use her left hand to write and comprehend course materials. She even audited two classes at Kellogg during the spring of 2018.She goes to the rehab center three times a week. Each session is 3 hours, practising speaking, walking and control of her right hand. Every day, she repeats the efforts at home. In addition, she practises writing, reading and critical thinking analysis at home.What is Winnie’s plan in the future one year?Winnie plans to undergo treatments in Guizhou, China from July to September 2018, before she transfers to MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center in Hong Kong (recommended by her doctors) to continue rehab until August 2019. Why does she choose to head to Hong Kong?Winnie is a Hong Kong citizen. MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center in Hong Kong has been recommended by her doctors. The center will continue Winnie’s rehab with speeches, Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT).

When she hit her 20's, she found out she carried the gene Ankylosing Spondylitis, which is arthritis affecting the spine and large joints within the body. To treat this, she was taking Humera, an immunosuppressant that weakens the immune system. Because of this, she had contracted a cold, which turned into bacterial and viral pneumonia that put her in the hospital for a month. During that month she had acquired sepsis, a life threatening blood infection. This lowered her chance of living from 70% to 30% in a matter of days, then to 15%. To save her life, they put her on Levophed, a drug which helps regulate blood pressure; it shunted all of the blood from her extremities to her major organs to keep her alive. This resulted in a quadruple amputation. A quadruple amputation is very rare, but necessary. All 4 prosthetics she will need comes to $225,000, which is not covered by her insurance. Tiffany is currently engaged Moe Fonohema. She's been the most humble, positive light that our family has ever had and we've been blessed to welcome her into the family. She is 38 with 6 amazing kids: Nesi 27 (adopted from our family), Davontae 19, Inoke 16, Robbie 10, Mckelvey 7, and Jamison 4. They've been together for 4 years, and all 4 years she's become the biggest blessing our family has had, from letting us have family parties in her own home to letting us feel as though her home was our home. These last 3 months have been difficult for our family because we were dangerously close to losing her. At this point, the medical bills, the cost of the prosthetics, the renovating of the home to accommodate to Tiffany and other things that our family will need to financially support her family, we need all the financial support we can get. There is no one you'll find more deserving, more loving and humble than Tiffany Fonohema. We APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU. She especially sends her love.  If you can't help financially, your love and support is just as appreciated and necessary. Whatever you can donate, it is treasured in every way possible. Lets get Tiffany walking again, back to a normal life again, together. There are plentiful social media platforms, so share where you can and we can achieve this goal together.

I was living a great and happy life in New York City with my wife of two years, had a soaring career in software sales, and a deep passion for running and sailing; Until everything changed.In March 2017, I noticed my right foot wasn’t keeping up with my left and was causing me to trip. I didn’t think much of it until my primary care doctor told me this was a much more serious issue and referred me to the first of what would be many neurologists. I was tested for everything from AIDS to Zika. MRI’s, CT scans, EMG’s, blood tests and painful spinal taps - The results were inconclusive, and the bills were piling up rapidly. The fear of the unknown was causing all sorts of stress – Weight loss, sleeplessness, lack of focus, and the depression was starting to get worse. Still not receiving answers, I enrolled in the second opinion program at the Mayo Clinic. Guided by Dr. Andrew McKeon, my parents and I spent a week in frigid Rochester, MN repeating all the painful tests hoping for answers. As every test result came in, we tried everything we could to interpret each result. We laughed and cried with happiness when we thought it was something simple and panicked and cried together when the simple things were ruled out. We were physically exhausted from the emotional ups and downs. On the last day at Mayo, January 5th, 2018, I was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).Now 38 years old, my world has been turned upside down. My body was quickly failing me. My balance and walking were affected making me fall many times; my hands could barely hold a fork or type an email; And getting dressed was nearly impossible. The fear and anxiety of daily living were increasingly more paralyzing. Moving to my parents house in order to receive the extraordinary care I would need to live out the hardest time in my life meant leaving everything about my life in New York City behind.  I was crushed.A New Chapter and Where We Need your HelpAfter making the transition to my parent’s house, it became obvious the house was not set up to accommodate someone with my needs. Things you don’t typically think about, like widening doorways, renovating the bathroom so I can roll in with the wheelchair, adding ramps, and installing stair lifts to get me from one floor to another. This doesn’t even touch on the need for wheelchairs, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, lawyers, in-home nursing and technological devices to cope with my failing body. None of this is covered by insurance. How Can You Help?We need your support to make the changes necessary and cover the costs of things that insurance won’t. Because of the progression of this disease, we need your support as soon as possible.Please help us reach our goal by sharing this fundraising campaign on your Facebook and Instagram with your friends, family, and colleagues.ALS, also known as Motor Neuron Disease or Lou Gehrig's Disease, has no cure, yet. The average lifespan from diagnosis is two to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for my family and me. What I do know is that I’m focused on doing everything I can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages. As many of my family, friends and coworkers know, I have a strong positive mental attitude and a passion for life. So as difficult and sad as this diagnosis is, I remain positive, and I gather my strength from the outpouring of love and well-wishes from my family and friends, my employer, PerfectoMobile.com, and the men’s group, MDI (mentordiscoverinspire.org ).No one knows how long my fight will last, however I have the will and determination to battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this is already creating a tremendous financial burden on me and my family.  I need your generous help with contributions to help me fight this awful disease and to allow me to have the highest quality of life possible.

Recovery seemed to be going well until three weeks later, when Peter had a devastating stroke while in his doctor’s office. The stroke trauma team worked quickly, but Peter is still facing a long road to recovery. Peter has significant weakness on his left side, which affects his arm and leg, limiting his mobility. Insurance paid for 100 days in a good rehab center with occupational, physical, and speech therapy daily. He had hoped to go home, but that was not in the cards. He’s now in assisted living, with its nursing and aid support, which he needs and which insurance doesn’t pay for. So, from here on out, those costs fall to Peter and Marge. He’ll continue to seek out additional rehabilitation services for PT and OT. He is doing some walking, about 75 steps per session, with the help of a walker and a physical therapist. Slow but steady. Though his body has taken some hard blows, Peter's determination, wit, and humor remain in good form.While Peter and Marge focus their energies on the demands of recovery, many friends and fans of this gifted music-maker are pulling for them wholeheartedly and want to help.

ALS is insidious, robbing its victims of the ability to walk, dress themselves, talk, swallow, and ultimately breathe. All while leaving the mind perfectly intact. Already, I’ve lost all use of my left arm and approximately 60% of my right.  ALS has no cure and no effective treatment. The average lifespan from diagnosis is three to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for me and my family. What I do know is that I’m focused on doing everything I can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages. As many know, I have a passion for life. So as difficult and sad as this diagnosis is, I remain positive and gather my strength from the outpouring of love and well-wishes from my family and friends.I’m an outdoors enthusiast and enjoy many activities like fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, skiing and golf. I played football in high school (team captain) and college and have always been passionate about sports. I love live music and have been known to enjoy a concert from time to time. Even though ALS has limited my activities, I continue to find ways to enjoy life by surrounding myself with friends and family. My faith and positive outlook allow me to take it “One Day at a Time” and live one of my favorite mottos “Tour for Life”. On this journey, my family will face extraordinary medical and incidental expenses. ALS treatment is not covered by insurance and estimates for medical costs alone range from $200,000-$300,000 each year, covering ventilation, feeding tubes and in-home care. Additional large expenses may include moving to a new home with greater accessibility, wheelchairs, lifts, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, aides/in-home nursing and technological devices to offset muscle paralysis. No one knows how long my fight will last, but I’m assuming I’ll battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this will leave a tremendous financial burden on me and my family.My wife Peyton and I have three children, and while they may receive some financial aid for college due to my diagnosis, it’s likely that we will still face over $250,000 in additional expenses to finance their educations. It pains me think I will be placing such a burden on them.Peyton and I have dedicated our lives to raising our family and giving whatever possible to the community in New Canaan, CT.

The bottom line is that we felt the situation has degraded in recent months, and Joe was nearing a likely catastrophic outcome.  We hired a professional addiction counselor to travel to Chicago and convince Joe to enter an extended 90+-day program in Florida that is designed for long-term alcoholics who cannot beat the disease.I am extremely pleased to report to you all that we worked with the counselor, Joe’s family, and the new program to transport him down to Florida on June 18 where he officially started this new long-term recovery program.  For now, he is out of Chicago and in safe hands, ideally recovering for good.  I am writing to ask all of you for your help.  We hope Joe will be in Florida for years to come, but no way to know for sure.  If you are in Florida and can visit him, please make time to go see him.  If you have a company that can hire him after his 3-6 month program, please try to do that (he is an MIT grad MBA and a star-man after all!)  Plus we’ve got about $55K of known expenses related to this program.  But we also want to provide him post-program monitoring, counseling, career options, and financial support in order to give him an out-sized chance at a sustained recovery this time.  All-in, we’d like to raise a minimum of $55K to cover the program, with a target of $100K to provide an extended timeline of care and support.  CNQ, this is a rare opportunity where we all have a chance to significantly help a dear classmate and friend before you receive that dreaded graduate death notice in your inbox.   Please donate what you can to help, and check back….if we have not raised our target, please keep giving.  And we ask that you don’t be anonymous, add a note to Joe and show your name and $ amount, large or small, so all can see how we came together as a class to help a friend.  Thank you all for your consideration.  Go Army, CNQ86 rules.Dean Dorman and John Noble",371,150,6,373,1 month,10 days ago,8 days,2018-09-03

I had just moved to Northern Virginia for an engineering job and was pursuing a part-time MBA degree at Georgetown University.I had tons of energy and a positive attitude towards life. On January 6, 2011, I went to the ER with vision problems (blurred and turning sight) and severe shortness of breath. I was told that my lungs were full of blood clots and suspicious nodules. My doctor was surprised I made it alive to the hospital. More scans revealed that I also had a 10x10 tumor in my retroperitonium completely blocking the flow of blood in my IVC and liver lesions. I was diagnosed with Stage 3C testicular cancer. I was immediately taken to surgery. A few days later, I started chemotherapy.  I had lots of complications because I was too sick. After finishing my chemo, I went to Indiana to remove the remaining mass in my abdomen, known as an RPLND surgery. Unfortunately, my remission only lasted 20 months. I was devastated once again when I learned that cancer was back at my regular check=up with my oncologist. I started a different chemo regimen this time, but it failed. After visiting two centers of excellence, I found out that my only option left was to have High Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Transplants. On December 22, 2013, I enrolled in a research trial and started my treatment in Houston, TX.  Unfortunately, the treatment was so toxic that I lost my liver, kidneys and almost my mind with hallucinations and toxins in my body. I developed sepsis right around Christmas, said farewell to my dear parents, and closed my eyes. Miraculously,  I did not die. But, I was totally and permanently disabled with end-stage liver and kidney disease, for which, I had to do dialysis three times a week. I subsequently had two lung surgeries since cancer kept coming back. Since my last surgery, it has been almost three years that I am cancer-free. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy life with my disabling conditions, too many to write here.  Cirrhosis led to significant ascites that had to be removed by the gallons.  I finally got listed for a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant. My score is relatively high that I am at or near the top of the list depending on the week's blood work results. I may finally be able to get back to a relatively normal life and perhaps even work again. However, not having worked for five years, my condition has put me and my parents in a financial constraint. The costs associated with a transplant are very high, particularly with the life-long expensive medications one needs to take. So, with all that, I and my family would appreciate your support. It is fairly difficult for me to write openly about myself and ask for help.  If you are not able to make a donation, please send your good thoughts and encouragements. We appreciate all your kindness and support at this difficult time. I look forward to becoming a healthy and productive member of our society once again.",610,1.8k,0,613,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

After a trip to the emergency room, a battery of tests and scans, and a lot of agonizing waiting for results, Gerard was diagnosed with both kidney and colon cancer. The devastating news hit Gerard, Nicky and their three small children, Elizabeth, Gina and Stephanie, very hard. But in true Franchi fashion, they immediately took to fighting cancer head on. After Gerard’s abdominal and kidney surgeries, rounds of chemotherapy and many prayers, he received the news that he was all clear! Gerard had beaten cancer.Fast forward to October 23, 2017. On a routine follow-up scan 3 months after Gerard was given the “all clear”, the doctors once again found tumors. At that time the cancer had spread to Gerard’s stomach and liver. Gerard continues to receive chemotherapy treatment at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Currently due to his compromised immune system, Gerard has had to miss or delay treatments. As always, he remains focused on the task of fighting this awful disease. He is determined to overcome the odds. The old adage of ”taking it one day at a time” has never rung more true for Gerard, his family and friends. Gerard’s positive outlook on an uncertain future is inspiring. Despite the emotional rollercoaster of the past year and a half, Gerard continues to embody what it means to be a fighter, a husband and a father.The Franchi's have made it through these trying times with the love and support of their family and friends and their faith in God. Everyone around them has been extremely generous whether in the form of gift cards, meals, donations or a simple phone call to check in. The constant outpouring of care and love has meant the world to them. The reality of a fight such as this and Gerard’s determination to provide for his family, has continued to push him forward.After careful discussion with Gerard’s medical team the decision has been made for Gerard to stop working. Chemotherapy has taken a great toll on his body and immune system. This is a very emotional and difficult decision for Gerard. His brother Bobby, and everyone at R.A.Franchi Corp. made it possible for Gerard to work up until this point,he could not have done it without you.As of July 1st , Gerard will begin the 5-month waiting period prior to receiving Social Security Disability benefits. This campaign is in place to help lessen the financial burden on the Franchi family during this exceptionally challenging time. Thank you for supporting this beautiful family. #franchistrong",717,1.6k,4,724,2 months,1 month ago,1 month,2018-09-03

After investigating a stiff neck, something didn't ""sit right"" with our amazing pediatrician and she ordered blood-work. Follow up blood work in the Hackensack ER turned from just anemia to a small mass on his kidney to a CT Scan that showed a much bigger problem. Every corner we have turned has been devastating. We are currently residents of the Pediatric Oncology Department at Hackensack University Medical Center and are being treated by a very very large team of Doctors, NPs, Nurses, Techs, and more specialists than you can imagine.

This is the only desire for 34-year old mom, Leena, from the moment she gets up in the morning to the second she falls asleep.  Just a month ago, Leena was suffering from prolonged cold-like symptoms and finally ended up in an urgent care facility. She was found to have a mass in her lung and was sent directly to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. They had found a large tumor in her right lung. For Leena, a non-smoker, and her husband, Kuldeep, this was earth-shattering news. They lived a simple life, a family of three with little Neel being the center of their hearts.  The diagnosis was absolutely devastating. They went from thinking this was a persistent cold to being told that she has advanced lung cancer. Since then it has been a roller-coaster ride for the family, running around and working with a network of friends trying to identify the right hospital, oncologists and, most importantly, the treatment path to cure this evil disease.In the following days, Leena went through a series of biopsies, scans and other tests.  Every visit to a hospital and lab became a nightmare for the family as it brought more devastating and scarier news.  Also, taking along a baffled little Neel to the hospitals with his mom instead of his pre-K classes is no small task, as you can imagine.  Two days later, a brain scan revealed more shattering news- a 2.5 cm tumor was found in her brain.  Furthermore, scans showed that the cancer had spread to her abdomen. She was told she had Stage IV disease. There was no time for them to think, ""Why me?""  On April 27th, Leena was admitted to the George Washington University Hospital.  She was lucky to find one of the best neurosurgeons to remove her tumor.  He was set to go on vacation but decided to take on her case.  With the blessing of guru P.P.

They are the kindest-hearted and most generous people in the world, and now it is our chance to help them as they have helped so many others. They have been traveling a very tough road for a while now, and unfortunately more difficult times lay ahead. Kim’s 100-mile charitable races have been replaced with a struggle to complete the simplest of daily tasks.  After a very long period of uncertainty, misdiagnoses and straight-up dismissal of obvious symptoms, Kim D’Arcy was finally diagnosed with Severe Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease (CNL) and several other co-infections know as babesia and bartonella. Kim is now living with a host of multi-systemic neurological and physical ailments including debilitating fatigue, profound memory loss, extreme migraine-like symptoms, severe pain and swelling in her joints, night sweats, body spasms, and breathing issues.  She is undergoing very intense treatments on a daily basis in hopes of killing off the spirochetes that make up Lyme disease and co-infections.  She had a PICC line implanted in Oct 2017 and is being treated with intravenous IVs five days a week, as well tons of AM and PM oral antibiotics.   While there are many parts of this chapter in their lives that straight up suck, one of the most difficult is how hard it has hit them financially. Outrageously, Chronic Neurological Lyme is not recognized by the CDC in the US and therefore treatment is not covered by insurance companies. So ALL of the expenses in testing, diagnosing and treating Kim’s very legitimate illness have been paid OUT OF POCKET by the family. This, as you can imagine, is an expense that is beyond the scope of imagination for any of us and is ruinously unsustainable.  Kim is going to be faced with approximately 2 more years of treatments, possibly more. Additionally, Kim and John’s two beautiful children, Lilly and Jack, will have to undergo their own rounds of intense testing as Kim’s strain of Lyme could have been transferred to them in-utero. These kids are ROCKSTARS and have been through more than their fair share of hardships for such little loves.The goal is to raise $60,000.00 to help with the family’s medical expenses now and for the next couple of years. After comprehensive research and consultation with doctors and specialists, due to the severity of her condition, Kim has been advised to enter an intensive treatment center in Germany where she has been offered a spot at the St. George Klinik. Germany recognizes Chronic Neurological Lyme disease as a major health issue and the clinic there offers a state-of-the-art Hyperthermia Treatment program that has been very successful in treating others with this debilitating disease. Kim and John have been in direct contact with some of these patients and their results have been amazingly positive. Because of her advanced stage of this disease, Kim must take action NOW. Her spot at St. George is guaranteed for June 25th! The treatment is done over a three week period, it is very expensive and it is not covered by insurance.  They need our support to get Kim well and give them all a last chance to return to a normal life. Will you please join me in helping out the D’Arcy family, who have always been there for others? They would never ask for themselves, so I am asking for them – let’s be there for them… no family could be more deserving.  For more info on this treatment and testimonials of those who have successfully been though the process please click here:  www.St-george-hospital.com",465,622,0,467,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Medical,7,Garrett Roe fund,https://www.gofundme.com/garrett-roe-fund,"SANTA ANA, CA","August 11, 2018","$100,000","$86,882","On Thursday, August 9, my fiancé, Garrett Roe, suffered a stroke at the age of 32. He is alive thanks to the wonderful staff at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, however words can not describe how devastated we are. Garrett is an A320 First Officer for JetBlue and is based in Long Beach, CA. He was born and raised in the state of Washington. Garrett has always had a passion for airplanes and he started flying at the age of 18.  When not in the air he enjoys boating, mechanics, working out, and spending time with friends.  His positive energy and generousity are an inspiration to all who know him.  On August 9th, Garrett woke up with complaints of a headache. He got up, made coffee and went in to the bathroom to get ready for work. Seconds later, I glanced over and saw him on his stomach using the door frame to pull himself out of the bathroom. The look on his face was a look I will never forget. I ran over to him and his eyes were open but moving side to side, and he was drooling and clenching his jaw. His body was overly tense and he kept trying to stand but could not. When the medics arrived, they made the decision to airlift him to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. The helicopter landed at Harborview and within 10 minutes of landing Garrett had had a brain scan where they located the clot, and was undergoing surgery where it was successfully removed.  Garrett ended up suffering from an ischemic stroke caused by a carotid artery dissection. This means that he had a tear in the 2 inner layers of his carotid artery...the blood pooled and formed a clot. The clot then traveled to the brain and caused him to have a stroke. Approximately one-third of the left hemisphere of his brain developed damage. This has caused paralysis of the entire right side of his body and the inability to talk and communicate. This is the start of a very long road for Garrett. He will need immense therapy and rehab to get his body working again coupled with a large amount of support from family and friends to keep his spirits high. His mother Tanya, and I appreciate all of the love and support we have already received! This is going to take an army but with strength, love and prayer we are confident that we will get Garrett back to the way he was!I will be updating along the way as we go through this journey together.

Rainier, the highest mountain in the State of Washington · Become a top salesperson at one of the most successful technology start-ups in the history of Seattle · Become an avid addict of physical endurance, including daily visits to his local cross-fit gym · Strived to become a model for fuel efficiency with his ownership of awkwardly massive trucks (that one's a joke - but not really...;) In early 2016 the tumor had advanced and by the end of the year had transformed into a stage 4 terminal Glioblastoma.  (Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM ), to be specific)  Since that time, it's been a roller-coaster of highs and lows for Mike, for his friends, and especially for his family.   The one take-away most of us close friends and family share is our awe of Mike's undaunted strength and relentless fight through this time.  The guy is a Clydesdale -there is no other person on earth who could have fought this thing harder.  It's been both admirable and heartbreaking to watch... Two of the things that weighed heaviest on Mike throughout this time was the legacy he’d leave behind to his kids, and what he would be able to do to care for his family after he was gone.  Many of the people reading this will undoubtedly be involved in the legacy part.  We'll ensure that his kids be exposed to all of the things that made their dad smile, we'll ensure they know the man their father was, how much he cared for them, and they'll know the tremendous amount of love he had for both of them.As it pertains to the concern about taking care of his family, well, that's what this is about.   This is a call-out for any and all people who ever knew Mike and Agnes, who were friends to them, family to them, who worked with them or may have met them through other mutual friends.  This is our chance to make a splash.  This is our chance to support Mike's wishes and show this family the support group that they have.  Mike passed away Wednesday, May 23rd at 12:12am at his home. He was surrounded by his family and loved ones. His passing was peaceful and without pain. Even though the family has insurance, the out of pocket expenses are piling up and staggering.  As friends to the family, we feel the least we can do in this situation is to help take some of this off of their plate ,and see to it that they receive the utmost support.  All of the money raised from this campaign will go towards the family’s everyday costs associated with Mike’s illness.This is your chance to help.

Medical,7,Proton Therapy for Zach Rizzuto,https://www.gofundme.com/zachproton,"FORT MYERS, FL","March 25, 2018","$125,555","$126,635","My husband Zach was an otherwise healthy 37-year old man until summer 2017. Zach was diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2017, just less than three months after the birth of our daughter, Roxanne. He has undergone three brain surgeries - one biopsy and two craniotomies - to diagnose and resect a huge brain tumor. The tumor has been diagnosed with brain cancer, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III ) to be exact.  This campaign was created to help us raise money for his proton beam radiaton therapy treatment since his health insurance carrier denied it because their medical directors, Dr. Ellen Rabun and Dr. Joan Huppi , claimed the treatment is unproven and not medically necessary. We disagree. More importantly, Zach's doctors in Philadelphia and Fort Myers disagree. So, we're reaching out to you for help. Thanks in advance for reading our story!Three institutions reviewed Zach’s MRI scans and pathology - Gulf Coast Medical Center, Duke University, and the University of Pennsylvania . The recommended treatment for his condition is tumor resection surgery followed by 6-weeks of radiation and chemo (Temodar), and then 12-months of chemo maintenance. Zach can receive either photon radiation or proton radiation, but we appealed UnitedHealthcare to approve the proton radiation three times because it uses a lower dose of radiation which can reduce the long and short-term side effects, including protecting cognitive abilities and lowering risk for more cancers to develop. It is the preferred treatment due to the location of his tumor cells in his brain. Proton radiation has a reduced side effect profile, which means Zach could have less neurocognitive side effects and the left side of his brain’s healthy tissue would be protected from the damaging effects of radiation. He will experience side effects with either form of radiation but would be able to have a better quality of life if he has proton radiation. This is critical for our family because he is still a young man, has a ten-month-old daughter, and is in the middle of his professional career.We are grateful and appreciate each of you for your kindness, support, and generosity. Thank you for sharing our story with others. I can promise you that we will pay it forward someday. We will also be sure to teach Roxanne about the love that exists in this world and remind her that there are so many good people in her life.We take great pride in being fiscally responsible individuals. We wish we could pay for Zach’s treatment in full with our savings, but we don’t have enough saved, and it would take us too long to get the amount needed without drastically delaying his treatment (and risking tumor regrowth). We also have medical bills from his previous surgeries to pay. His proton treatments will cost $125,554.11. Fifty-percent of his treatment ($62,777.05) must be paid before he can begin. The remaining fifty-percent must be paid in 5 payments of $12,555.41 over five months after treatment. There are no other payment plan options available for proton therapy at Penn. Zach will also receive very little of his income (if any) during his six weeks of treatment because we have to be in Philadelphia. We hope he can return to work fully soon after, and that is one of the main reasons we have been fighting for proton radiation over traditional radiotherapy. There will be neurocognitive side effects for either type of treatment, but they are lessened with proton therapy. Since Zach’s radiation will be on his brain, it is critical to preserve as much healthy brain tissue as possible in order to maintain his quality of life and cognitive functions after treatment.Longer StoryHow did you find it?Zach experienced several confusion/disorientation/staring episodes in 2017, just before and after Roxanne was born. He initially convinced me they were caused by the stress he was under at work. I finally got him to go to a doctor in early August, and an MRI was ordered. We were called back into the office on the same day the MRI was performed. I knew the news could not be good. Thankfully, my mom had been staying with us for a few weeks to help me with Roxanne as I started to transition back to work. We were told Zach had a 7 cm mass (described as huge in the report) on the right temporal lobe of his brain. We now know the episodes he was experiencing were absent seizures. He never even had a headache, which is amazing. We immediately met with oncologists and a neurosurgeon in Florida to find out what to do. A biopsy surgery was performed on August 23rd (when Roxanne was just about 3-months old). His biopsy results were inconclusive because the hospital in FL did not have a neuropathologist on staff, but lymphoma was ruled out. The slides were sent to the Mayo Clinic for an expert consult and his MRI scans were sent to the Duke University Brain Tumor Center.  The initial pathology from the Mayo Clinic indicated the tumor was a low-grade glioma (grade II). The news wasn’t the best or worst we could receive. We waited several weeks for Duke to get back to us and eventually the neurosurgeon called and talked to Zach about removing the tumor. We were not immediately comfortable with the discussion, so I decided on a whim to reach out to the brain tumor program at the University of Pennsylvania since we were going to NJ for my nephew's first birthday anyway. My experience working with a nurse navigator at Penn was impressive. We were able to get three appointments scheduled with experts in less than ten days. The appointments were long but eye-opening, hopeful, and thorough. The surgeon showed us the intricacies of Zach’s tumor on his MRI scans, and the Medical Oncologist drew out an entire plan with us while we were sitting there. He also taught us about the molecular variations in brain tumors and described why those were important to understand. It was the first time since Zach’s initial MRI that we felt some positivity again. It was also the first time we left an appointment and could smile. We immediately felt that Penn was the best place for Zach’s surgery and adjuvant treatments.Why three brain surgeries?The first resection surgery was a success (90-95% of tumor removed), but the initial thought was his tumor was grade II at the time. Everything at that point was textbook grade II. It wasn’t until the post-op pathology of the larger sample that doctors discovered it was more of an intermediate grade II/grade III, which can be more aggressive. So, the surgeon recommended going back in to get more of the remaining tumor out, which would cause Zach to essentially lose the peripheral vision in his left eye. Zach wishes he could have raised his hand during the first surgery and told the surgeon to remove more the first time, but obviously that wasn’t an option. The second resection surgery was also a success and 95-99% of the tumor was removed. There is still a small amount of tumor in his brain because it was dangerously located near a critical blood vessel and was inoperable.What about work?Zach’s company was acquired early in 2017 and he was told he would be laid off by the new company later that summer. He was offered a new position at another company (during Hurricane Irma) and accepted. However, FMLA cannot be used unless you have worked for an organization for at least 12-months. He has had some short-term benefit payments, but those have been exhausted. My employer has been amazing to work with, and I have been able to keep up with my job, thankfully. I have a wonderful manager and team and they have been so supportive and caring. I am very lucky! I cannot use FMLA either because I used most of my available time for maternity leave. Lesson learned - try your best not have multiple family medical issues in the same 12-month time frame! Zach cannot drive because of the seizures, so I must drive him everywhere, including to work and doctors' appointments. I often have to miss meetings and events at work to do so.  Many of you know how much Zach loves driving and cars - they were his passion. This has been extremely difficult for him. My dad has also been living with us in FL since he started a new job in Fort Myers in September. My mom, aunt, and brother have been a great support system and babysitters for Roxanne during our time in NJ/PA. We have Roxanne in a wonderful child care facility while I am working. It is expensive, but it has allowed her to have some routine and consistency in her life, for which we are grateful. The caregivers have become a second family for her.Detailed Diagnosis (Pathology) - Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Grade III GliomaZach was initially diagnosed with a low-grade glioma (WHO grade II). After his first tumor resection surgery, pathology indicated there were pockets of anaplasia, which means some cells were actively dividing and the tumor was more of an intermediate grade II/III. This means we need to be very aggressive in his treatment plan because tumors can recur and grow into higher grades. Zach does have several molecular markers that make his tumor more treatable than others. We’re told his tumor has 2 out of the 3 that respond well to chemo and radiation treatment, but we cannot delay.Recommended TreatmentTumor resection surgeryTemodar (chemotherapy pill) - during radiation and 12-months following radiationProton Radiation - 6-weeks at Penn Medicine in PhiladelphiaCost: $125554.11 ($62777.05 due prior to treatment; five-month installments of $12555.41)TimelineSpring/Summer 2017 - absent seizures observed by MelAugust 9, 2017 - Meet with GP to Discuss Episodes (first doctor appointment with a GP ever while I was married to Zach)August 14, 2017 - MRI in the morning, Called into office in the afternoon.

It meant Poppy would not run into major complications for a few days and we could figure out how to get her to the states. That put a lot of pressure on us. We lived in LA and that was where Poppy and my wife had insurance coverage. It made the most sense to us to try to fly her there for care. Maggie spent many hours on calls with her insurance company doing her best to stress the nature of the situation. They bounced her around from extension to extension and made things extra impossible for us to ensure an air evacuation. They tried to send us a regular airplane without physicians and our doctor caught that when she called them to make sure they were sending the correct plane. The insurance contracted a Mexican plane with the right equipment and personnel that we felt confident could do the job. Our prayers had been answered and Poppy could be in LA in a day and a half. We breathed a little easier and felt relieved that was happening. The company called us two hours before departure and informed us there was a landing gear malfunction and they couldn’t come. Insurance had failed us multiple times. Me,my wife her aunts and father were in the room when that news came in and you could feel the hope just leave out all at once. We all panicked. My wife cried and we just felt we were out of options. The doctor came in and handed my wife a list of people with planes and helicopters that served the west coast and when my wife called a few they responded. “Lady I can’t fly emergency missions to Mexico” It was then that I entered the small little bathroom in the hospital room that i dropped to my knees and with tears in my eyes and cried out. “God show me your will for this baby. Show us where you want us to go” I promise you not thirty seconds after i walked outta that bathroom the doctor asked to speak with me in the hallway where she said. “I know a doctor in Miami.” I stopped her right there and immediately said “go now and please call them” i knew from the moment i heard Miami that that was where gods will was. I walked back into the room with my family and announced “Poppy is going to Miami” My wife responded with “Miami? How will we do that? She’s not covered there and it’s so far from our home.” I said i don’t know but that’s what we’re going to do. So here we are today in Miami.

My name is Rose, and my family and I are asking you to please help save my brother John's life. John is 35 years old and is currently battling an aggressive, life-threatening brain tumor called a glioblastoma (GBM). The average prognosis for a GBM patient is 12-15 months. There is no standard treatment for recurrent brain cancer and this presents both a financial and medical challenge. John’s current treatment plan includes Avastin and Keytruda infusions, but these treatments are not curative, so we have been tirelessly searching for more options. Through outreach to many doctors and foundations, John has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help John in his battle with brain cancer!In 2012, John was a typical 29 year-old living in Chicago, building a successful career, and engaged to the love of his life, Allyson. One day at work, John was in a meeting and very abruptly started seizing and was rushed to the emergency room. Everything changed for John and our family that day. John was diagnosed with an anaplastic astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer. He underwent an awake craniotomy which removed 60-70% of the brain tumor. Immediately after surgery, John started radiation, chemo, and adopted lifestyle changes which doctors and researchers thought would be helpful.(Here is John after his first surgery with his neurosurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa (Dr.Q),  in 2012)From 2013 to 2017, the conventional treatments helped stabilize John’s tumor and John and Allyson started a family by welcoming first Dennis (now almost 4 years old) and then Matthew (now 1 year old). John continued to work, but also committed himself to encouraging others fighting for their lives through the Livestrong Foundation. He has spoken at and participated in numerous Livestrong events to help inspire others, all while continuing his own fight. (John, Allyson, Dennis (3), Matthew (1))Last May (’17), just a few weeks after Matthew was born, John went in for a routine MRI that produced devastating news; the tumor suddenly showed significant growth. This time the tumor was so aggressive that he started losing some of his vision and speech. In January (’18), John underwent his second awake craniotomy which was more invasive and painful than the first. The initial news was promising as Dr.Q and his team were able to get almost 90% of the tumor.(John in the ER on Christmas Eve 2017- always smiling!)However, the pathology results came back with the worst news to date- John’s recurrence was now a GBM. A month post-surgery the tumor had grown back to its original size, and a new tumor was found shortly after.  Despite all of this, John continues to be the most positive, empathetic and loving person you will ever meet. I think anyone who knows him agrees that he has a smile that is uplifting and a demeanor that can change the entire tone in a room. John is a fighter and he is determined not to lose this battle!

(Watch this video of John featured on the news as he was biking across Iowa at Ragbrai 2015. He talks about overcoming obstacles and staying positive!)This is where we need your help. John has serious vision and speech impairments which have ended his ability to work. Through outreach to many doctors and the foundations working to cure brain cancer, John has been offered a promising opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment is not covered by insurance. The cost for this treatment is substantial, around $100,000, and the need to start is urgent! To date, John and Allyson have paid for all medical costs in excess of insurance, but this is more than our family can handle. Please know that we would not ask for this help if we did not feel it was completely necessary. By donating to this cause, you are helping my brother get the treatment he needs to keep fighting! Additionally, your donations will enable doctors to pursue these leading edge treatments in research that potentially could save others from this horrible disease. Any funds raised that do not go towards treatment will be put towards providing John’s young boys a secure future.Thank you in advance for all your love and support!(Family with Santa!

We would be profoundly grateful for any contribution and for the diffusion of this heartfelt appeal among friends and people sensitive to this struggle.Many thanks.En algún momento de nuestras vidas, todos hemos sido afectados por el cáncer, ya sea personalmente o ayudando a un ser querido a combatirlo.

El costo es enorme pues afecta física, financiera y emocionalmente al enfermo  y a sus seres queridos.Mi hermano, Alejandro Fernandez de Cossio, fue disgnosticado con cáncer de pulmón a finales de 2014, con un pronostico de 6 meses de vida. El ha sido y sigue siendo un luchador incansable contra la enfermedad y ha superado con éxito una serie de tratamientos y, todavía, se resiste a darse por vencido. El oncólogo de Ale ha realizado la solicitud (rechazada) y tres apelaciones para lograr el tratamiento con Alecensa (Alectinib), continuacion del Crizotinib, que se le aplico cuando todo parecia perdido en marzo de 2017, re expandiendole el pulmon colapsado y disminuyendo considerablemente la masa tumoral en el mediastino. Lamentablemente el burocratismo y, lo que es peor, la negación a curar a un enfermo por el elevadisimo precio de la medicina que necesita, hacen imposible que Ale pueda acceder a la misma: el seguro no la cubre.El costo del Alecensa en USA es de $15,158 dólares por 240 capsulas (2 meses de tratamiento).  https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/alecensaCubrir un año de tratamiento ascendería a alrededor de $90,948, cifra imposible de costear por la familia.  Hemos recurrido a  organizaciones, fundaciones, farmacias, etc. pero, hasta ahora, no hemos obtenido resultados. Es por esto que divulgo esta situación pues yo, y los muchos amigos que conocen y quieren a Alejandro, nos resistimos a aceptar ser vencidos y queremos agotar todas las posibilidades.Estaremos profundamente agradecidos con cualquier colaboración y con la difusión de esta apelación entre amigos y personas sensibles a esta batalla contra uno de los flagelos  de la humanidad que continua sufriendo nuestro querido Alejandro.",343,1.3k,7,354,23 days,16 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Many a story can be told of Fritz selflessly giving to others. Whether building houses for the impoverished in Mexico or helping friends through their own personal cancer battles! Recently Fritz was re-diagnosed with Lymphoma. If I have the story correct, he was a survivor 12 years ago and given a Cancer Free diagnosis. Sadly, “C” has returned and it looks like the treatment is going to be more challenging than the first time.Fritz will undergo 3 rounds of potent chemo and for all 3 rounds be admitted to the hospital for 4 days when the medicine is being administered. Following the 3rd treatment, Fritz’s bone marrow will be harvested and frozen. He will then be admitted to the hospital for 5-6 weeks to have the “nuclear chemo” administered in hopes of killing all traces of the “C” and then his bone marrow will be placed back in his body to help produce health cells and help him recover. Following the 5-6 weeks in the hospital, he will be confined at home for an additional 5-6 weeks with a care giver. Fritz’s daughter is leaving her job for this period of time to be her dad’s caregiver.We are raising funds for 3 primary reason. 1. In essence, Fritz will be out of work for 4-6 months. The last thing we want Fritz worrying about is the financial toll this will have on him. We want him to focus on beating “C”s ass! And being healthy.2. While Fritz has health insurance, there is a 7K out of pocket deductible and many of the medicines that Fritz will be prescribed are not covered by the insurance. 3. Any remaining funds will used to help with the loss of income Fritz”s daughter will incur while taking FMLA to care for her dad.Fritz’s first chemo treated started Friday, April 6th.We want to thank all who contribute to this fund raising effort in advance.Chuck and Julia Brown",87,92,12,87,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Thank you to each & every one of you who has contributed to Howard’s medical care! We are beyond grateful! Howard has seen the donations, but has been too weak to acknowledge them personally. Three weeks out, he is at home recuperating. It has been a much slower recovery than his other two colon resections, but then again, this surgery was far more extensive and intensive. So far, he is mostly sleeping ...has a few bites to eat or moves to the couch and sleeps again. He has lost 30 pounds, but not his fighting spirit. His Drs said this is par for the course and he is doing great! Many patients take 2-3 months before their appetite and energy return. In the meantime, we are sustained by the compassion of our friends and family and our love for one another. Please continue to keep Howard in your thoughts and prayers!

3/21/2018 Here is an article written by Linda Yang for Colon Cancer Coalition about Howard. Please continue to spread the word and contribute to this campaign. (Link to full article:  https://coloncancercoalition.org/2018/03/15/faces-of-blue-howard-brown/)

I was born in St. Louis in 1966, five minutes later than my twin sister, Cheryl. I grew up in the Boston suburbs of Framingham, Massachusetts, being very active in all sports, but excelled most at basketball. I graduated in 1988 from Babson College in Wellesley, MA, which is the number one college for entrepreneurism in the world. I had a career in high technology – software, Internet, and cloud computing.

I’ve been married to my wife, Lisa Brown, for over 23 years and we have a daughter, Emily, who is a junior in high school. Lisa is my current caretaker, but being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer has put tremendous stress on the family and me. I am currently on disability and not working because the chemotherapy has been kicking my ass. My wife had neck surgery a few years ago and currently is not working as well. We’re trying to keep things as normal as we can for our daughter, who is an amazing student and a soccer goalie.

My story with cancer started when I was 24-years-old. I was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. I failed three different chemo recipes, but my twin sister, Cheryl, was an exact HLA (human leukocyte antigen) match. I had a bone marrow transplant from Cheryl that saved my life at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA on May 24, 1990.

I had blasting chemo and twice daily full body irradiation prior to my bone marrow transplant. I achieved remission, or NED (no evidence of disease) for 28 years until I went for my recommended colonoscopy at age 50. I learned that I had stage III colon cancer and immediately had a colon recession surgery where 13 inches were removed. I started and completed 12 grueling rounds of FOLFOX from August to February. A CT scan revealed that the colon cancer had spread just outside my colon. I had a second colon recession surgery in March 2017, removing 10 more inches, and started immunotherapy stage I clinical trial.

In July of 2017, a CT scan showed metastases to the liver, peritoneal lining, bladder, and outside of the colon. I was now diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. I started a new recipe of Irinotecan/ Avastin for 10 cycles, which have shown some “interval improvement,” what is also known as shrinkage. I was recently approved for CRS-HIPEC (cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) surgery scheduled for mid-March. I plan on “getting to NED.” I have a daughter that I want to see graduate high school, play college soccer, and walk her down the aisle; get my life back.

I’ve spent my life as an active volunteer in my community. I was the president of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), and am board members of the Jewish Federation, the AJC, and the Hebrew Free Loan. I have raised millions for Jewish communities and people in need. I am a trustee for Babson College, and the board’s president for the Babson Alumni Association.

When I think of “Get Your Rear in Gear,” it means a “call to action.” The call is to recruit participants, volunteers, and fundraisers to support Colon Cancer Coalition in its mission to support colon cancer education, early testing, research, patients, caregivers, and families. This is my second go around with major life threatening chemo. I have a huge worldwide movement and following on Facebook that is called “HBStrong!” I have so many people that love me, pray for me, and follow my journey. Of course I try to keep it as positive as possible. My words of wisdom: cancer sucks, but the beast must be slayed, and that is all I can do each day. Keep the faith.

3/13/2018 Please join us in supporting Howard Brown and his family in their time of need. We are part of the HBstrong Network of college and high school friends that want to support the family during this critical time.
Howard has been battling Stage 4 Colon Cancer (22 cycles of chemo, 2 major colon reconstruction surgeries, immunotherapy).  He faces major life saving surgery on March 13th called CRS HIPEC - see video link

We are launching phase 1 of this contribution campaign to raise $50,000 to help Howard and his family pay for medical bills and other expenses not covered by insurance. Please join us by making a contribution of any size and sharing with others.

Medical,8,"For Our Warrior, Jeff",https://www.gofundme.com/for-our-warrior-jeff,"MORRISTOWN, NJ","August 1, 2018","$85,000","$82,885","To our Family, Friends, and Friends of Friends who have followed Jeff's story....As many of you already know,  life changed for our family in April of 2016.  My brother Jeff Leloia was diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 33.   Before we dive into Jeff's story, I want to first tell all of you about Jeff and for one second, forget about this terrible disease that has changed our lives and his life forever.   My sister and Jeff's story is a true fairytale.  Two teenage kids (18 years old) meeting at the very beginning of college- Quinnipiac University.   Since the day they met, the two of them have been inseparable.    They are the two nicest people you could ever meet.   They never asked for anything out of life besides being happy together and wanting to start a family.    Its a love like no other and one that I look up too everyday.  They have been together since 2001 and married in 2009.   As so many of you know,  I met my husband at Jeff and Alyson's wedding.  Tommy was Jeff's groomsmen and I was the MOH.  From there, it was history.  Tommy and I owe much of our lives to the two of them....   Jeff and Tommy were best friends and now brother in laws. It couldn't have worked out better!     Jeff and Al went onto have 2 children since 2009. Vanessa is 6 years old and the happiest little girl.  Nicholas is 3 and loves trains and giggles at every little thing.    Life as we knew it, was as perfect as it could be.   In April of 2016, everything changed for us when Jeff had a seizure.  I will never forget that day as long as I live. I had just hung up the phone with my sister and within seconds, it happened. Alyson had called back in a panic and I assured her it was probably nothing to worry about.  Boy, do I wish I was right.  Unfortunately after many tests, we discovered a brain tumor was pushing on his motor area (which caused the seizure).  In September of 2016, they removed a Grade 3 brain tumor at Columbia Pres in NYC.  He underwent 6 weeks of radiation and chemo cycles for almost 1 year.   Things seemed to be okay....In October 2017 a questionnable ""spot"" showed up on his MRI and this ""spot"" had been growing on each subsequent MRI, raising concern for a recurrence.  We were told regular standard of care was not going to work (regular chemo) so they opted to find a clinical trial that would hopefully help.  On Jan 22 of 2018, Jeff entered into a Phase 1B clinical trial out of Columbia Pres. in NYC.   Jeff was in the hospital for over 50 days during this trial.  Since he was the first person to enter this specific trial for a long period of time, side effects were not known (but of course, we knew there was a risk).     The trial left Jeff with weakened mobility on one side of his body.   He went to Kessler after the trial to work on getting his strength back.  While the strength on his one side did not come back fully, Jeff's positive attitude remained.  We continued to live life as best we could knowing he would be monitored every 4 weeks with MRI scans.  He came home from Kessler in March of 2018.    As you can imagine, being away from home for almost 2 months was beyond difficult but our warrior never complained.  In May of 2018, his MRI scan came back showing something....doctors were unsure what this was and hoped it was an effect from the trial he had done.  We continued to monitor it.   We planned our family vacation to Lake George in June.  The day before we left for vacation we received news that the latest MRI was still showing this ""effect"" and the doctors believed it was cancer again.     As you can imagine, it was a devastating blow to find out the day before we were supposed to leave....But despite this, we went on our vacation and had the best time.   But are you surprised? That is who Jeff is....Despite overwhelming circumstances in his life, Jeff has never gave in.    I am so proud to be his sister.After our few days away, we knew we would come home and have another battle to fight.    The doctors had suggested they biopsy this new area to determine how best to treat it.   We were told it would be an in and out situation (an overnight) but unfortunately it was not. Jeff went in for this biopsy on July 11 (Alyson's birthday) however his speech and now the ""good side"" of his body was weakened.   This was due to the biopsy.    Again- pure devastation.   While we knew the cancer would eventually impact his movement and speech (due to where the cancer is in his brain..by the motor strips), we were not prepared for this to happen so suddenly nor for it to be because of the biopsy we were assured would have no risk.   This has been one of the hardest parts as a family to watch.     Once this happened, the doctors were unsure if something had happened during the biopsy (stroke, etc) so they took another MRI.   It was not a stroke, etc so the immobility and speech issues were due to the biopsy they did however the MRI showed something we were also not prepared for.     This day was the worst day of all our lives since April of 2016.On July 13th, we were told that the MRI showed the cancer had spread to the other side of his brain.    Not only were we left to deal with this horrible news but we also now had to deal with the immobility on his ""good side"" due to the biopsy they had done.    Jeff had to go back to Kessler Rehab for a few days but we were anxious to get him home immediately because we know time is now precious.     He is now home and we are making him as comfortable as we can given the situation at hand.While the doctors can't give us timing -- and clearly they are very unsure of many things when it comes to this awful disease, we were told if wanted, Jeff could opt for radiation with a mix of immunotherapy.   Jeff was now considered in Stage 4 and the cancer showing up on the MRI was most likely a glioblastoma.   The prognosis of a glioblastoma is not great but we will continue to fight and NEVER give up hope that a miracle may come our way!!!   Our warrior will not give up despite his physical complications either!!     We had a chair lift put into the house to help bring Jeff from downstairs to upstairs and a ramp has been put in on the outside of the house to make it wheelchair accessible when he has to go to radiation (He goes back and forth to the city for radiation through all of this).  Our family has not asked for help up until this point.   While Jeff's story has been out there, we have shielded everyone from all the details- the hard stuff.      While none of us know what tomorrow will bring, this is what we do know.Jeff is now unable to work as his position has been released at this point (he has not been able to work since the clinical trial started in January).  My sister has had to stop working as a Physical Therapist and is now acting as his full time caregiver.     As you can imagine, this has been extremely difficult for her and words will never be able to explain what she is going through.     Due to the fact that she can't work and his position has been released (he carried the benefits), the insurance is no longer covered.   They are offered COBRA to pay on their own for the time being.   Insurance only covers 1 hour of home health care for 12 visits and unfortunately, Jeff now needs more.    My parents, Jeff's parents, and my husband have also been acting as caregivers and helping with the kids but we need more help- everyone has done a tremendous amount so far.  Family and friends have done so much already too and we thank every single one of you but at this time, we are hoping to raise some money for Jeff, Alyson and the kids to help pay for the full time aide we will need (approx. 250 a day), help cover some insurance costs (approx. 1600 a month), installing whatever other equipment is necessary, etc.        Any donation would be MUCH appreciated.  Every single dollar of it will go to help Jeff and the family during this horrible time and anything that is left, will go directly to Alyson to help with the children and home.    Please consider donating to the Leloia family.    It saddens me that this is something we even have to be writing...I have always been the one on the ""other side"" of these pages.   My brother is my HERO.  He is this entire family's hero.  And we will never give up hope.  We will continue to fight this terrible disease until we can't anymore.  We will never stop trying to find a cure so this doesn't happen to any other family.   At 35 years old, no man should ever go through what Jeff is going through and has gone through.  Take a minute today to hug your loved ones and tell them you love them.  In a split second, life for us changed and the scary truth is, it could happen to any of us.  This disease isn't hereditary- it just happens.    Vanessa and Nicholas's lives will never be the same because of it and my sister is watching her best friend and husband fight for his life.     It is unimaginable and absolutely unnatural that this is happening to their young family....We love you Jeff.  Not a day will EVER go by where we don't fight for you and your family and for others who are battling this same disease. Good Vibes Only to our WarriorPam",737,1.9k,31,735,1 month,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Pineal gland tumors account for less than 1% of all brain tumors and as a result, determining the appropriate course of action can be both tricky and expensive. The fear and shock from this diagnosis has been overwhelming for Charles, his Mom (Wendy), his younger brother (George) and his older sister (Katherine). Charles now has an incredible team of Doctors at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and is headed there to begin a six month course of chemo treatments next week.If one had to choose the best expression to describe Charles it is that he is a ""Can Do Guy"". Charles has demonstrated this time and time again: on the lacrosse fields at Lake Forest High School, carrying a full course load at De Pauw University, graduating and gaining a spot with IBM consulting and being the chief Cook in the Cook household! When his Dad passed away 12 years ago, Charles stepped up to the plate at 11 years old and became a stronghold for the family. Just before this diagnosis, Charles commented that he was in the best shape of his life: physically, mentally and emotionally. Charles remains determined, focused and deliberate in his dedication to defeating this tumor. In fact, he has said several times that he actually believes that he will be a better person for having gone through this experience. Charles' strength is not a fluke. His Mom, Wendy, is an incredibly strong woman who has dedicated herself to her three children ever since their Dad's sudden death 12 years ago. Like Charles, she would give you the shirt off her back and is incapable of saying no to any request. She is one of the most selfless people I know. Charles' diagnosis has shattered even Wendy's perpetually sunny disposition. It is clear that she is overwhelmed and frightened. If the dictum: You have to be a friend to have a friend has any basis of truth, then Wendy and Charles Cook could jointly run for Mayor of the World! I know that many of his, her, mine, our friends will hear about Charles diagnosis and want to help out. There are numerous uncovered costs that will arise and any donations to help defray those expenses would be incredible and very welcome. Additionally, prayers, positive thoughts and warm wishes are truly appreciated.I will keep all of you updated as Charles conquers this challenge.XOXOTEAM CHARLES",684,1.0k,2,678,3 months,28 days ago,3 months,2018-09-03
Medical,8,Wiley Corra,https://www.gofundme.com/5c6oabc,"DURANGO, CO","March 30, 2018","$85,000","$81,278","Our beautiful boy Wiley is fighting hard for his life and health after a fall and traumatic brain injury which occurred in the most benign of settings. On March 24th, 2018, after a great day of  skiing with friends in Utah,  we went out for a movie. Killing time, waiting for the show to start, we were outside on a pedestrian bridge. There was a low wall on the opposite side that, deceptively, looked to have grass immediately behind. In fact, there was a gap between the grass and bridge that dropped 25 feet to a service road below. Excited and energetic, Wiley lept onto the wall, looking back at us, and dropped to the other side expecting a short and soft landing on grass, as we expected too. Hearing a delayed hit from below, we knew this wasn’t the case.  

Frantically, I searched for a way down. When I got to my  boy I was sure he was lost to us. I now know that grief. Within five minutes the ambulance was there; ten more and he was at Intermountain Hospital, Level I Trauma Center in Murray, UT.  Dr Peter Maughan performed a decompressive craniectomy (removal of a section of skull to allow the brain to swell). There is significant damage to his left brain. Other various fractures and breaks are not of concern, his spine is okay, and bruised lungs will heal. He is fighting hard. 

Wiley has always been a determined young man. He is an excellent, Freshman Honor Roll Student at Durango High School. He is sweet, loving and caring toward his friends, family, and teammates, never in serious trouble, focused and attentive (when we pry his nose out of video devices). He has a long and arduous road ahead toward recovery. While he is as well prepared for this journey as anyone could be, the outcome is uncertain.  The care at IMH is outstanding. Given the circumstances we couldn’t be in a better place. 

We so appreciate your taking an interest in Wiley’s recovery. The love and support that has been flowing from our home community, Durango (and well beyond) is staggering.  As hard as this is-and it is the hardest thing we have ever endured- it would be unimaginable without your love, prayers, and positive thoughts for Wiley’s recovery. You are helping  us become the warriors needed to fight alongside our precious boy. Thank you.",639,1.4k,11,646,5 months,3 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Those of you who know Sofia know how much she loves her family and her friends. One of her favorite things to do is spend time with her cousins. She also loves singing, acting and cheerleading. Sofia is currently in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. She suffered a severe head trauma and is still in critical condition. Sofia has a long recovery ahead of her, but she is resilient and a fighter. My parents have not left her side and will need to continue to be by her side as we face the long and challenging road that lies ahead of her. I want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out, kept Sofia and our family in their prayers and sent food. Many of you have asked what else you can do to help. As my parents will need to continue to be by her side any donations for my family are greatly appreciated and will help with expenses. We know Sofia is a strong girl and will find the power within to fight her way through this. Please continue to pray for my sister and our family, and for all the other families impacted by this senseless event. Thank you.",1.0k,5.9k,5,970,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Complications of her diabetes left her without enough oxygen for a number of hours which in turn caused significant trauma to her brain. While the prognosis is not good, we all believe that there is room for hope and that the Jackie we know, the one that has been battling diabetes for years while managing to make a wonderful life and career for herself, will continue to fight. The Habeebs are extremely grateful to all that have gone to visit, reached out, offered help, and prayed for Jackie. With that said, I would ask that we offer our financial assistance as well. As of today, the plan is to bring  Jackie up from Charleston back home to Boston where she will have the best care and be close to friends and family. The process of moving her via med flight is not covered by insurance and is in excess of $13,000 and while insurance will cover a lot of the actual costs associated with the medical care, there is still a significant portion that the Habeebs themselves will incur. There isn’t a person that has met the Habeebs that hasn’t been touched by their selfless generosity. There is always a chair at the table for another guest, another bed for those in need, and a happy home for a wondering soul. When my sister in law was pregnant, they hosted her baby shower. When my brother passed away, they held the celebration of his life there. And when my wedding came to an end, it was the Habbebs that invited all guests for a nightcap. While I may have benefited more than most, I’m sure each of you has a fond memory of a holiday spent in their kitchen, a Patriots game in their family room,  or a sweltering summer's day spent in their pool. As the Habeebs often say, we are all cousins. It’s time we come together and support the family that made all of us family. This is going to be an uphill battle but with your support and prayers I have no doubt that Jackie can do it. Please contribute what you can.-Please note that this fund has been approved by the Habeeb family and is much appreciated",641,2.0k,64,643,1 month,28 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Medical,9,Assist Sally Newman,https://www.gofundme.com/assist-sally-newman,"BROOKLYN, NY","April 19, 2018","$100,000","$77,285","Hi Friends, We are raising money to help our friend Sally Newman, who is fighting osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.  Sally was one of the maids of honor at our wedding and a friend for more than 10 years.  She is an amazing person and friend, and she brings light into the lives of everyone she meets. Sally is also an amazing lawyer and advocate, who has done so much for so many people. Sally graduated from NYU law in 2009 and she is the founder of  Charleston Legal Access, a nonprofit sliding-scale law firm meant to help people gain access to legal services.  It is a wonderful endeavor, but obviously not a very profitable one. Beyond her illness, Sally and her husband Romain are facing high medical costs and she is unable to work. We want to help her to have more comfort during this fight.  Please help support Sally during this challenging time in her life.  Thank you, Kimberly Ong & Ian Marcus AmelkinPS--Here is an amazing letter that Sally recently posted on her prognosis and how she is handling it: Off Course — An Update on How Cancer Hijacked my 2018 Dear everyone — this is dedicated to everyone who I’ve been unresponsive to in the past few months, or not responsive enough. When I was going through the diagnosis process and the research and treatment consultations, I was too overwhelmed to communicate much; now, in chemotherapy, I’m so fatigued that I feel further away than ever from catching up. Please know that if I haven’t responded it’s not for lack of loving you with all my heart. Even if we haven’t talked much lately.This is also dedicated to everyone who I don’t know well who might be reading this. I’ve spent hours and hours reading up on cancer and cancer treatment and surgeries and have a new, profound appreciation for everyone who has been willing to share intimate details of their struggles so people like me can find encouragement and hope in their stories. I’ve been quiet on social media the last few months but am making this public because who knows — if I can pay it forward and this is helpful to someone, a shade less privacy is worth it.The bad newsAs you might have heard, for the last year I’ve had a mystery ailment in my left glute. Actually, I first noticed my left side looked a little different from my right side about four years ago, but one year ago, I noticed my left leg seemed longer than my right, and I started getting lower back pain and tightness and swelling in my glute. I started visiting a long list of professionals, including an orthopedic surgeon, who seemed unconcerned, and acupuncturists and massage therapists, who were stumped. Finally, this fall, I found a primary care physician (he thought maybe my right side was atrophied) and insisted he refer me for an MRI, which showed one fist-sized solid mass in my soft tissue, surrounded by an ominous looking network of — something — infiltrating the muscles around the mass. The orthopedic oncologist I was referred to diagnosed it as something called tumoral calcinosis, which is a rare disease associated with mineralization. To make a long story short, he was wrong, and luckily his and his team’s incompetence was evident enough, early enough, that I knew something was off and went for a second opinion less than a month later at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Within two days, they had diagnosed me with osteosarcoma based on complete imaging (the MRI I got in Charleston was “not very good” — burn — according to the Mayo doctors, which is to say that they didn’t bother imaging my whole pelvis and missed the important part that showed it was CANCER). It sucks that I didn’t catch this earlier. On the other hand, let’s all thank the baby Jesus, Buddha, mother Earth and everyone who encouraged me to be pushy and pursue that second opinion (edited to add: to the tune of $17K, which my insurance denied, and denied on appeal, and I put on credit cards. In case anyone has forgotten how truly shitty our healthcare system is).Anyway. This is where I frequently get stuck in imagining breaking this news to people, because there is cancer and then there is cancer, and after a cancer diagnosis, the natural followup question is what the prognosis is. There are cancers where 99% of people survive with the right minor surgery, and there are cancers where…. Well, where a lot of people don’t survive. And the truth is, I have a profoundly shitty kind of cancer. Osteosarcoma (which is extraordinarily rare in adults) is generally acknowledged to be treatable only by chemo (a few months), followed by surgery, followed by chemo (more months to a year or more, depending on how well it works). Oh, and the surgery that was first offered to me is something charmingly called a “hindquarter amputation” — and if that wasn’t bad enough, a few days later the offer was rescinded (by those doctors) because my cancer is too advanced to amputate my hindquarter. Yeah. This was obviously a lot to take in. As for prognosis, earlier in the century, overall survival rates were 20%. Now that chemo exists, it’s more like 60–70%… unless you have metastases at diagnosis, which I do. My rate is more like 20%. Except that right now I’m not eligible for surgery, which puts me, statistically, at a five year survival rate of — well, generously, 10%. Except! Except! As I’ll discuss at some point, I have a badass immune system (this has been scientifically measured), which puts me at… higher? I don’t know. Listen, this cancer is bad. There are treatments. I’m going to do my best to help them work. None of us are guaranteed a certain amount of time on earth. Probably this is the thing that will kill me. But I’m trying to survive. And one thing that the research shows is that having a loving support network helps cancer patients thrive, and I am being absolutely lavished with love and support. Believe it or not, one of the hardest struggles of this process (and therefore of my life) has been feeling worthy of the care I’m receiving. That is true.If you’re feeling down after that prognosis, which, I don’t know, hopefully you are? Let’s pause here to check in with my all time FAVORITE cancer author, Kate Bowler. Buy her book! I might be biased by the fact that it was published right when I desperately needed to hear from a thoughtful, funny, insightful 38 year old woman who also was told recently she had incurable cancer and yet is living a meaningful life and has made sense of things, but it’s very, very good, and every page resonated with me. Her NYTimes article, What to Say When You Meet the Angel of Death at a Party, which first made me aware of her genius, is also excellent, and, get this, one of her podcast episodes features the best Washington Post writer, Alexandra Petri, who she is friends with. A ton of people have asked if there is anything they can do for me, and mostly I ask for smoothies and cat gifs (and occasionally money), but darlings, what I really want is to be friends with Kate Bowler (and Alexandra Petri). If you could hook that up that would be amazing.What it’s like (? Sometimes? For me) getting diagnosed with cancerOne thing about hearing that my life expectancy is somewhere in the months or years instead of decades, and that I’ll spend — some, most or all of that life in chemotherapy, is that all of these everyday objects and concepts feel like they’re whirling off into space, having come unmoored from my expectations and implied plans. Here are a few things that upon crossing my mind have sent me into the depths of despair in the last few months: hairties, a dental checkup, my mortgage, retinol creams, Latisse, Lasix, my disorganized garage, continuing legal education credits, houseplants, my solar panels, kittens, videos of circus performances…It’s like living in a horror movie where I look at my hiking shoes and they’re like “LIFE IS FUTILE, SHORT, AND PAINFUL” and I start sobbing. It’s honestly extremely disorienting. But thankfully, after four months, I’m getting used to the new reality and regaining my sense of humor. The irony of living out what might be my last year or two waiting to get used to the idea of dying is not lost on me, by the way.In general my cancer diagnosis doesn’t seem very personal. My pain is mingled in the pain it has caused and will cause my husband, my father, my sister, and dear friends, family and colleagues, and while everyone suffers in different ways we are in it together, which is both uplifting and crushingly sad. But this constant barrage of cancer reminders feels much more personal, and so that much more isolating and frightening.I’m also embarrassed to say that one of the overwhelming emotions I felt upon diagnosis was… well, embarrassment. Imagine that through no fault of your own, your car was run off the road during rush hour, and you were stuck in a ditch while everyone rubbernecked on their way home from dinner. This is more or less how I felt — humiliated, off course, and certain that I would be on display for everyone’s even more embarrassing sympathy. Except, times a million because it’s not my car, it’s my life. I hate sympathy! I mean, I like love and attention, like everyone, but I hate the idea of being a tragedy being tsked over.Which is why I felt a soft sense of comradery and fellowship when I learned that a Dartmouth classmate of mine, Ali Youssefi, died recently of cancer. Ali and I were in the same freshman orientation hiking group, and became kinda-friends because we were also assigned to the same freshman dorm. I think my husband and Ali’s wife will forgive me for mentioning that I had a huuuuuge crush on Ali. His family is from Iran, and he had lovely brown eyes and a dashing smile. Dimples? I think so. At the time, our political views, which were the only thing that was really important to me, diverged to an extent that shocked me, although I’ve probably mellowed a bit with him, and more recently he’s reposted some Bernie Sanders quotes (and found a career as a developer who brought affordable housing projects to his hometown of Sacramento — so wonderful), so we might have come around in our middle age. Just a few weeks ago, he did a facebook fundraiser for Palestinian children for his birthday, and I donated, and he messaged me to say thank you. Drowning in my own recent diagnosis, I didn’t respond, but I wish I had, or that I’d looked at his profile, and realized he was in the midst of his own illness, about to start another round of chemotherapy for stomach cancer. Diagnosed in July, he was gone eight months later. I’m so sorry for his loss. But a part of me reached out to him and felt less alone. Me too, said a part of me. I’m dying too. We’re friends in this.And now…I’ll add at least one more entry on Medium later to talk about treatment, but the short story is that I’m currently in NYC being treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I’ve made it through two months of a protocol that’s known for being brutal — a three week cycle of high dose cisplatin and doxorubicin — and I’m doing OK. Not to spoil the hopefully good news of future updates, where I’ll talk a little more specifically about what my doctors are doing and what the rest of the protocol might be, but it looks like my cancer is responding to the chemo for now. It also looks like the remainder of 2018 will be spent in treatment, although there’s not a clear course charted, which if you know me of course you know is driving me insane. As Kate Bowler says, it feels like walking toward a cliff and trusting a bridge will be built over it when I get there. But I’m putting one foot in front of the other, and people who love me are holding my hands.",438,415,3,448,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

In January 2017, Michele was diagnosed with Stage IV Adrenal Cancer which has spread to her liver and lungs. She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and has undergone many surgeries. Michele’s cancer is unusual as it is a very rare and aggressive form that many doctors have not seen. However, this cancer can find just about anyone and change the course of their life as it has theirs. She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and has undergone many surgeries. Despite the side effects associate with these treatments, Michele continues doing what she does best, sharing hope and love to humans and canines. She smiles, even when it’s difficult, she lends an ear to those she loves even when she needs to be heard, she works diligently to care for dogs in need. Always putting others first. Michele’s kindness holds no boundries and her love is unconditional.  At this stage in her journey, Michele’s oncologist recommends that she undergo yet another treatment called Cryoablation. This time insurance has denied this treatment and her oncologist believes it could help her tremendously. He has been 100% dedicated to her recovery and she trusts him 1000%. Michele is suiting up for battle once again! While chemotherapy and radiation have been undeniably tough, she has the same positive attitude, strength, and determination to beat this disease, a feat equally as inspiring. Michele needs your help! During this time, friends and family have been sitting on the sidelines, asking what they can do to help. The Magnano’s have appreciated all of the love and support that friends and family have given and weathered the financial responsibilities on their own. Now, there is an opportunity for us to step off of the sidelines and help them help Michele. The time has come when they need it most. All they really needed were your thoughts, prayers and love, until now.  Anyone who knows Michele, Joe and their family of humans and canines, already know that if the roles were reversed, they are always the first ones to lend a helping hand. No situation prevents them from coming to the aide of someone, even during the toughest battle of their lives. Even though they do so unconditionally and without expectation, now is the time that we can help and be a part of Michele’s fight to beat this dreaded disease. Beating this rare disease would be amazing for Michele and to give hope to others who share her battle.  Every little bit will help them to raise the money they need to cover these medical expenses.

The treatment seemed to  be effective in getting her body to reboot with Doctors hoping that her Kidneys and Liver would begin to heal themselves.  After three weeks at Mount Sinai, they released her back home and while she was determined to be home for mothers day, she quickly developed a fever and we immediately had to bring her back to Overlook again.  Unfortunately, due to the seriousness of the condition, this time they had to transfer Maggie to Columbia Presbyterian in NYC where it has been determined she will need a full liver transplant.Like most who have to deal with a crisis, we never imagined being in this position and certainly weren’t prepared financially for what was to come.  We don’t live in a grand house, we don’t take elaborate vacations and we spend most time trying to find a way to make ends-meet to cover basic expenses.  Sadly, this has totally exhausted all of our resources.   Not only are the medical procedures coming with profound expenses that aren’t covered by insurance, but also the sad fact that Maggie has no paid time off due to the fact that she just started a new job at the Westfield Public Schools this year.  In the effort to pay the mounting medical bills, after care for the kids amongst other things, we are getting to a point where we have exhausted all of our reserves and need help financially. While certainly a humbling experience, please help. LoveThe Grabko's",667,1.4k,10,673,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

While serving overseas, Jack suffered a gunshot wound to the head and immediately received medical treatment by the US military.  Jack was stabilized overseas and transported to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) where he started the healing process.  He spent 39 days at WRNMMC before being transferred to Massachusetts to start his recovery.During his military career, Jack took part in every major conflict that the United States has been involved in since the early 90’s. If you know Jack, he kept a private life. If you had the honor to serve with Jack, you know his actions in combat were heroic. Jack and his wife have three beautiful children; his oldest daughter recently graduated from college and his younger daughter is currently a full-time college student. His five-year-old son is very energetic and truly a chip off the “ol’ Souza block”.  Upon arrival at WRNMMC, Team Souza (Jack’s wife and kids) in typical military family fashion established a 24hr (three 8-hour shifts) bedside vigil so he would never be alone in his time of need.  Now that Jack is out of ICU and on the road to recovery, “Team Souza” has incorporated the newest team member, Jack’s five-year-old son, into the fold, and he is enjoying much missed quality time with his dad during recovery. Jack is not only an incredible parent to his three children, but also to the kids of his close friends who have deployed in the past, as many of these children consider him a father figure and refer to him as “Uncle Jack.”Jack is making impressive progress every day and everyone who knows Jack knows he will make a full recovery- it’s just going to take time and lots of effort.Jack’s friends request this GoFundMe site be established to assist Team Souza through this challenging time and to help with future unanticipated costs of recovery.  Thanks so much for your loving support for Jack and his family during his recovery.",246,1.2k,5,237,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,9,Help Robin Recover,https://www.gofundme.com/help-robin-recover,"ORADELL, NJ","April 1, 2018","$50,000","$73,156","#HelpRobinRecover Hi my name is Scott Salem and the purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for my wife Robin, and mother of Matthew, to help her continuing battle against multiple cancers.BackstoryIn early 2013 Robin found a lump under her arm and after a few tests was diagnosed with two types of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. A course of chemotherapy called R-CHOP was prescribed and treatment began. The treatment consisted of one 6-hour infusion every three weeks for a total of 18 weeks. Halfway through the chemo a routine scan was performed to determine the status of the Lymphoma. The scan showed that the Lymphoma was in remission, but it was also discovered that she had Colon cancer as well.The Next Step In the summer of 2013 it was determined that Robin required surgery to remove the tumor in her colon and had to pause the chemotherapy for the surgery. The surgeon had to remove her cecum, appendix, and 16 inches of her bowel and she came through it with flying colors. The doctors told us that the cancer was fully removed and to resume the chemotherapy, but in her weakened condition Robin developed an infection to the surgery site and had to undergo wound therapy. Finally, late in the year she was able to complete the Lymphoma treatment with relatively mild side effects such as weakness and hair loss.RemissionIn early 2014 we got great news, the follow-up tests showed the Lymphoma in remission and no signs of the colon cancer and Robin was put on a maintenance chemo drug called Rituxan to help keep the Lymphoma in remission. The oncologist determined that no other treatment for the colon cancer was required, the rest of the year went well as she got stronger and was able to be taken off all treatment.Our Worst NightmareIn the beginning of 2015 after routine follow-up tests it was found that the colon cancer had returned. Wow, hearing that news was like being hit by a Mack truck. Robin was determined to beat it so after another surgery to remove a few more inches of her colon, another course of chemo was recommended. This was named FULFOX which consisted of 12 infusions, one every other week, and each time she was sent home with a pump to continue medication for 48 hours longer. Unlike the previous chemo the side effects this time were brutal. Robin was hospitalized a few times and had to pause the treatment to regain some strength. Finally, near the end of 2015 she resumed the treatment.The Battle Had Just BegunThen out of nowhere she started losing her balance, kept falling, and her arms and legs got numb. The oncologist described it as temporary neuropathy caused by the chemotherapy. We were shocked because we had no idea that this was a possible side effect. Robin went on and finished her treatment but her temporary neuropathy turned out to be permanent. She has been mostly bed ridden for the past 2 years. The Fight ContinuesRobin is a fighter, and has vowed to keep going, at the end of last year the cancers remained in remission, then very recently it was discovered that her Lymphoma has returned, we are still deciding on the course of treatment because Robin will never give up. Please Help Robin RecoverWhile our insurance covered most of the expenses we had to hire private nurse/aide to care for her while I was at work, which is not covered. We have drained our savings and have gone into considerable debt to cover the related expenses that are not covered. In addition to the private care that is required there are other non-covered expenses, such as certain medical equipment and modifying our home to make it handicapped friendly. The last 5 years have taken a toll both physically and mentally on the whole family. We ask you to please donate whatever you can, $1, $5, $10, any amount will help Robin continue her fight against this devastating disease. We will keep you updated on her condition and I know with your generosity she will be a cancer survivor.

The doctor perscribed him antibiotics thinking it was pneumonia.  Once he finished the treatment he still did not feel well and went back to the doctor.  In early December,  the doctor ordered a CAT scan which came back abnormal.  A week later Eric and his wife Jessica flew down to Seattle to see an oncologist at Sweedish medical center. The first day Eric had fluid drainned that had been building up around his right lung.  The following day he had a PET scan and a MRI  to help doctors better understand what might be going on.  On December 12, 2017  Eric and Jessica were given a heartbreaking diagnosis.  Eric had stage 4 non small cell lung cancer.   He is not a smoker, nor has he ever been.    At that time the doctor went over his treatment plan:  4-6 rounds of chemotherapy.  He will be having his 4th treatment tomorrow, March 8th.  As you can imagine there have been many expenses-  not all covered by insurance. There have been good days and bad days, multiple trips to Seattle, a stay at the hospital here in Sitka, medical supplies, missed work, costs for hotels, and more to come.  The bills are not far behind. If we could all come together as friends, family and community to  help lift a piece of this burden off of their shoulders, then there will be a sliver of sunshine in their darkest hour. Prayers are answered.  Please pray for Eric and his family.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.",116,534,0,118,5 months,26 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,10,Help fund  treatment for Jawad,https://www.gofundme.com/help-fund-treatment-for-jawad,"IRVING, TX","July 7, 2018","$50,000","$70,141","My name is Summar Hussein and I, with a heavy heart am creating this page in hopes of helping my sweet 6 year old nephew Jawad. Jawad is a bright, energetic, witty and  intelligent boy. He’s the light of our family and is loved by everyone he meets. You can always find him either reading or playing sports, and he is a die hard Boston Red Sox fan! Jawad loves spending time at the library and playing with his 3 older siblings. Since the day he was born, one of Jawad’s most admired physical traits were his eyes. Everyone who knows him will attest to this. Ironically enough, he is being tested with that same vital organ. About 2 months ago, my sister Nancy Hussein noticed that he was not making proper eye contact, he wasn't focusing properly.  She scheduled him for an eye exam but appointments were so far out. As the days passed he was no longer interested in going to the library to read, or picking up a book before bed to read with his mom. He mentioned a few times that everything was black.  His overall activity decreased. He was never one to miss a chance of being outdoors but he was showing more and more disinterest in everything he loved doing. The day of his eye exam finally came and he went in with high spirits and good hopes. Immediately upon exam, his right eye had no activity. It was not responding to light or movement. He was completely blind in his right eye.  Further examination by ultrasound showed white spots covering his retina. This was enough to have him scheduled for an emergent sedated MRI. Before being put to sleep for his exam, he told his mom that he was excited because this would be the best nap ever! And that when he wakes up he can’t wait to give her a big hug. On July 3, 2018 Jawad was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.  This is a rare form of cancer that affects young children. About 300 children in America are diagnosed with Retinoblastoma each year.  It can be caused by a rare genetic or congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene. The MRI showed several seed-like tumors starting around his optic nerve and around his retina. With the location of these tumors being so critical, it is impossible to remove them and restore his vision.  Retinoblastoma has a high curability rate but only after the child loses the affected eye. This is done to remove the cancer with hopes that it does not spread to any other parts of his body. His treatment plan will begin with targeted intra-arterial melphalan chemotherapy. This will be targeted to his right eye and will be done for 3 months. This will be done to reduce the size of the tumors to make his surgery easier. Since this intra -arterial treatment is not offered in Texas where he resides, he will be traveling to Philadelphia to receive the treatment.The next step will be the Enucleation which is the removal of the eye. After that he will be fitted with a prosthetic eye which will need to be changed every so often has he grows. We are hopeful that Jawad can be treated completely and become cancer free as soon as possible. Knowing that, being able to provide him with the best treatment available for him will put an intense amount of financial strain on our family.In Arabic, Jawad means “Generous”. We are kindly asking you to honor his name and open up your hearts to Jawad and donate generously. All funds will go towards treatment that isn’t even partially covered by insurance and to allow his father to take time off work to accompany Jawad to  his appointments and provide the support he needs on this difficult journey. Donations will also be used to help cover travel expenses for the time spent in Philadelphia receiving chemotherapy. Even the smallest amount will make a difference. Most importantly, we ask for your sincere prayers for his fast healing and that God makes this journey light on him and his family.

Everything was fine until he decided to go to hospital one day to get his breathing problem checked. Upon meeting the doctors in Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, he was told that it might have something to do with his kidneys not functioning properly and upon tests, found out that he was suffering from chronic tuburointerstitial nephritis. The differential diagnosis also included sarcoidosis and tuburointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome (TINU) and idiopathic forms of TIN. In simple terms his kidneys failed and they have to be replaced.He has insurance coverage in USA but still had to pay around $10,000 expenses for different payments in the hospital. His current condition is that he needs dialysis for every 2 days till his kidneys are transplanted. He wants to go to India as his family members are willing to donate kidney for him. It will cost $4000 to take him to India along with assistance. Surgery in India would cost him $12900 in Yashoda hospitals, Hyderabad. ICU charges would be $1400 per day. He would need to go through dialysis for 3 months which would cost him around $5000 for 90 days. Apart from all these expenses, Ravi still has the burden of his humongous master’s student loan on him. All of us know how difficult it is for a fresh graduate out of the college to manage such huge expenses.

As a result Bill was paralyzed from the neck down and has lived the last 48 years of his life as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. Bill took on his disability the same way he played sports, with courage and determination, and has lived these years independently, graduating from, working for, and retiring from UC Berkeley, initially as an early medical retirement, and now, full retirement.However, upon his full retirement in June Bill lost a major source of income, UC sponsored Long Term Disability payments at $900.00 per month. Bill used these funds to help pay for his daily attendant care needs required for a quadriplegic to live independently. The loss of these funds threatens Bill’s ability to live independently in his home. In addition, concurrently with this loss of income, both his needs for, and the cost of, attendant care are rising. Bill anticipated this loss of income a year before it happened and diligently cut back on his expenses at home and researched other ways to replace the income in order to pay for attendant care, through social services and public benefits, but to no avail, as the options were either disqualifying or share of cost prohibitive.As well, recent serious illness, surgery, and hospitalizations have left Bill recovering in bed since January, and the need for attendant care increasing even further than anticipated and his newly reduced income will now barely cover the cost of basic attendant care, if that. In addition to Bill’s normal daily routine of an attendant getting him out of and into his bed into and out of his wheelchair daily, and helping with his morning and evening hygiene and medication regimes, attendant care is needed when he is bedbound to bring him meals, turn him in his bed to prevent pressure sores, help with the same daily hygienic and medication regimes but now including assistance with respiratory therapies and wound care.Bill’s need for financial assistance is immediate and will be ongoing for attendant care and possibly other needs such as adaptive equipment for everyday living that could help mitigate some of the attendant care needs by keeping Bill healthier, back in his wheelchair, able to do more for himself without help, and out of the hospital.Throughout Bill’s life he always thought of others before himself in his school, family, and work lives, whether through his kindness, his volunteer work, or his patient listening to our stories and complaints, and now it is our turn to think of and support Bill.",230,189,2,293,1 month,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are reaching out to our friends, family, well-wishers and looking at crowd funding options to raise money to help with the treatment costsHow it beganIt all started in 2009, when training for a half a marathon, Smitha noticed a sudden onset of fatigue. She went from running 5mi comfortably to needing breaks every half a mile.She also noticed that her flip flops would keep coming off her feet while she was walking.Within a week, she felt an odd tingling sensation in her fingers that spread to her arms.  Followed by cold wet droplets on her face and neck.As these symptoms worsened, she knew something was seriously wrongIn Sept2009, at age of 24, Smitha was diagnosed with MSWhat is MS?MS is an auto-immune disease that affects the central nervous system.Our nerves have a protective sheathing called Myelin. This ensures that electrical impulses can travel through the length of the nervous system. In MS, the patient’s immune system marks this myelin as a threat and starts to attack them. As the myelin gets depleted, the brain can no longer communicate with the rest of the body effectively.The loss of Myelin shows up as black / white scar marks in MRI. MS attacks in waves. And, each attack results in further myelin loss. This directly translates to increased physical disability in the patient.When Smitha was diagnosed with MS, she was still a student. Her Student Health insurance did not cover the treatment costs. She could not afford to pay for her medication, out of pocket.In just 4 months after her diagnosis, hit by a giant relapse. The severity of attack alarming and it affected her quality of life permanently After coming to terms with these new physical limitations, we decided to make the best of what life had to offer. We traveled when we could, added a dog to our family, fostered a few dogs, charted our future, and eventually started thinking about starting our own family. In Jan2016, we were blessed with not just one, but a set of Twin boys!In the 9 years since her diagnosis, Smitha’s condition has constantly been worsening due to multiple relapses. Each relapse has required her to change to the next strongest FDA approved meds in market and none of them have been effective. After another attack in May 2018, we found out that our options for more drugs were quickly running out.We are now at to a point where we need to make some hard choices. If left untreated, the next MS attack could happen any moment. And that can lead to vision loss, memory issues, complete loss of bladder control and even needing a wheelchair permanently.Our kids are only 2.5 years old. And, in these 2.5 years, Smitha has been forced to watch the kids growfrom the sidelines.She was NOT there when the kids took their first steps.She was NOT there when the boys entered the swimming pool for the first time.She has NOT been able to walk with them to the neighborhood parkAnd, she knows, she won’t be able to help them ride a bike,or , play ball with them in the evenings,Or, come running to their aid, when they need her help.After her recent relapse, she has been feeling so exhausted, that she cannot even pick up her kids or even talk coherently when tired.All of this can change though. And the answer is in an extremely promising clinical trial called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, or HSCT.HSCT is the first and only medical procedure that can not only stop MS, but also reverse the symptoms of MS, by re-growing the lost myelin. The idea here is to wipe out the faulty immune system in the body with Chemotherapy, then reintroduce the patient’s stem cells and build a new immune system from scratch. This hard reboot of the immune system is a rigorous procedure that takes about a month and a half to complete. It is a risky procedure and is only administered to patients that have an aggressive case of MS and who have not responded well to other FDA approved medications. Among such patients, the results from past trials have been very promising. In upto 87% of the cases, this reprogrammed immune system does not attack the myelin again and thereby stops further progression of the disease. It has also shown to significantly reduce the patient’s disability and patients show continued recovery even after 4 years post treatment.But, the best of the insurance programs do not cover this procedure, as it is not FDA approved yet, which has put the entire burden of raising the money for this procedure on us.The last time the insurance did not cover her treatment MS dealt a swift and devastating blow. We are fully committed to defeating MS this time around.And with your help, we will be a step closer to achieving that goal.We don’t have much to offer you other than our gratitude. All we can say, is thanks for supporting us in our fight. There are a few ways in which you can choose to donate and help us out. You can read about this in the More Info section.You can also help by sharing this link on social media. Tag your friends you think might help. Also share this with friends and family who might be suffering from diseases like Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, progressive scleroderma or other forms of autoimmune disease. The same treatment mentioned above can help turn around their lives too.If we do manage to go beyond our goals, we will donate all the excess money to the next patient who is eligible for this trial and for whom the insurance does not cover this life changing procedure.",600,1.2k,0,584,10 days,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate. Thank you.",565,1.6k,14,565,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

In early March 2018, Jane started having strange symptoms: facial spasms, numbness, and weakness on her left side.  An MRI revealed a tumor on the right side of her brain.  Living close to New York City, Jane was able to get exceptional medical care. Surgery on March 14 resulted in the removal of 95 percent of the tumor. While her surgery was successful, the type of cancer she has — glioblastoma — is aggressive and may come back. Within the next month, Jane will undergo intensive treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy and a clinical trial at Sloane-Kettering. This next phase of treatment is arduous and costly.



After digesting this news, we decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf. Jane has not been able to work since her diagnosis and will not be able to work throughout the course of her treatment, which will also create a significant financial hardship for her family. She will and has already incurred significant expenses due to her recent neurosurgery, hospital stay and rehabilitation. These medical expenses are adding up quickly and will be prohibitive.Jane’s wonderful spirit has touched so many people. We hope that we 


can raise $75,000 to help defray her medical costs and ease her family’s financial burden which will allow her to focus on beating cancer.You can keep up with her latest progress and share your well wishes on her Facebook page.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking an interest in this very dear cause.   (Jane and her sister Nan)

The pregnancy was going well until complications started to emerge. Then the beginnings of a heart-breaking nightmare began to unfold. Little Aaron was born prematurely on Wednesday, August 1st and was delivered by emergency C-section. His health took a sharp downturn when he suddenly stopped breathing. Aaron was taken to the ICU where it was discovered he had an infection. Worse, Claire also came down with an infection that required immediate surgery. It was so aggressive, that Claire had four separate surgeries to remove all of it (it had invaded a large amount of tissue including several organs). The doctors worked frantically to eradicate the infection, but sadly, didn't expect her to live.  By a miracle, Claire has beat the odds, but she is still in critical condition. As with any medical treatment, the cost (so far) of treating her and her newborn son has been astronomical. Zack has been with his wife the entire time so their income has stopped. The continued treatment and recovery will take months and will certainly be financially devastating. It is hard to determine how much all the bills will add up to, but Zack and Claire are in urgent need of financial assistance to help them cover all the costs and stay on their feet. In the meantime, prayers are requested and much appreciated.

Nutter in no way intends to benefit financially from this fund and 100% of the donations raised will go directly to the Atkinson Family to assist with any financial expenses incurred during the surgery and recovery process.  Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.",619,1.7k,8,624,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Jen was in the 31st week of her first pregnancy and thought of nothing but the baby’s health. Within two days, doctors located two embolisms-one in Jen’s heart and one in her lung, as well as a “mass” in her heart. The “mass” turned out to be angio-sarcoma, a very rare form of cancer.On Friday, April, 6, 2018, Jen underwent her first chemotherapy treatment. She will continue to have weekly treatments of chemotherapy until doctors are able to deliver her baby at 37 weeks. Her treatments will resume two weeks after the baby is born. There are simply no words that can adequately describe the fear and the heartache Jen and her husband Matt have endured these past two weeks.Jen and Matt were made for each other. They met while volunteering for Youth Group, a program designed to provide academic opportunities for children in need. Through their shared love of history (they are both teachers), travel, education, and volunteerism, they fell in love and married in 2008. I met Jen when she started teaching at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Currently, Jen teaches Advanced Placement U. S. History and Psychology, a demanding schedule for any veteran teacher, but Jen’s dedication and hard work quickly made her one of the most respected members of the faculty.Jen is the type of teacher who spends countless hours before and after school helping students, some of whom are not even in her classes, with their schoolwork. She is constantly organizing fieldtrips, advising clubs, and volunteering her time to those in need. Every year Jen lets her hair grow, only to cut and donate it to The Jimmy Fund’s program that provides wigs for cancer patients. Just last year, Jen was voted the “Most Inspirational Teacher” and was also awarded “Teacher of the Year.” As a person, Jen is the most selfless person I know. She’s never too busy to sit down with a colleague. Take today for instance, while in intensive care Jen sent out a group text to our department reminding us of a colleague’s birthday, even apologizing for not being able to make his favorite dessert. There has never been a birthday or special occasion Jen has not remembered and celebrated.When Jen and Matt found out they were expecting a baby, it was a dream come true for them. Their excitement was infectious, both had dreamt of being parents. But since March 31th, their life will never be the same. Jen and Matt are both teachers and the medical bills are starting to pile up. Matt works in Providence, RI and has been making the daily trip from Providence to Boston to be with his best friend. Unfortunately, there is a long road ahead.With all the anxiety and fear they are experiencing, the financial burden is one that we are hoping to alleviate. Please consider donating to help Jen and Matt on their long journey but most of all, please pray for them. Thank you and please share this message, as I know Jen would be doing everything in her power to help anyone else in this situation.Sincerely,Mindy Morin",954,1.7k,12,956,4 months,19 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

As you know my favorite things to share are my kids and people helping people. My goal in to show you how awesome my family is or to make you smile. There is so much negativity in the world i like to share the good things. I don’t share much personal stuff on here so this next post is going to be quite hard for me. There is a part of my story that I have kept silent for some time now. Every time I open up about it I seem to gain a new understanding or some knowledge that may help me. I am not ashamed, I was just hoping to tell this story from the other side but it’s taking a little longer than I hoped. If you’ve been wondering why i haven’t been around or as involved as much as usual, here’s why! So….Feb. 23rd 2017, I got a phone call telling me that I had metastatic melanoma. Yes, a phone call! I had a swollen lymph node on my right side, went to a surgeon and had it removed. Feb. 23rd they called and told me what it was. If you want to hear about how horribly they delivered the news I can tell you in person. But, lets not dwell on the lame parts of this story!. So, here’s the deal. I got some scans immediately and nothing else showed up. I was elated!!! The doctors at SCCA at Evergreen put me on immunotherapy as a “insurance” plan. It’s called adjuvent therapy. Well, this therapy made me super sick last summer. I was sick from the 5th of July until about the 15th. (103 degree temp etc…). They took me off this therapy and gave me a high dose of prednisone. That is the worst good drug out there. If you’ve ever had it, you know what i am talking about. It makes you feel like you drank 16 cups of coffee and you are severely agitated. (sorry Jessie)Sept. 2017 we did a scan and found 6 new locations of potential disease. Two of which are on my liver (no bueno). I started a new immunotherapy called pembrolizimab (same as Keytruda ads on TV) and this had a mixed response but was not working as well as we hoped so, they placed me on a “clinical trial”. I tried that for a while, it sucked; bad side effects and had to get shots in my stomach daily for a while. The side effects have been rough. I had some serious migraines (which I never suffered from before), hearing loss, ringing in my ears, cluster headaches with stroke like symptoms etc… (Thank you Mercer Island Fire Dept., I hoped I would never have to call you but you were great). Needless to say some of the side effects have sucked! Good news, almost all of them have reversed!!! Yeah! I did some scans after being in the trial for a while and they found that I had 26% tumor progression. They allow up to 20% but 26% was too high so they took me off of the trial. The good news is my tumors were really small so 26% progression means they are still small. This brings us to now. I recently got in touch with some friends who encouraged me to go to CA to get some opinions. I have seen doctors at UCLA and MD Anderson in Texas. I have been to Texas two times in the last two weeks and have had a couple of tumors removed in the event we try T-cell therapy in the future. Right now I am eagerly awaiting to find out what my next treatment plan will be. I had surgery last week and am still recovering. It has been very painful but getting better slowly. The good news is that although my diagnosis is ""stage 4 metastatic melanoma"" there are a number of different treatment options still available to me. (the stages are based off of the last 10 years of survival rates. The medications today were not even available 2 years ago) I am an optimist to a fault as you all know. This has been a hard battle and will continue to be hard but I WILL WIN! I repeat, I WILL WIN!. I would love any and all support you can spare. I am a helper and i am terrible at asking for help when i need it. I want to give a big shout out to my wife Jessie and my Family. There is no way i could do this without them. Jessie has taken care of all the paperwork (there is TONS) so i can just focus on being healthy and not thinking about it until i need to. Jessie is a rockstar and i am thankful for her daily. My parents and in laws have helped us with airfare and hotel stays while traveling to all these appointments. I didn't think having an illness could require so much travel and travel is expensive, especially when it's last minute. Not worrying about the financial burden of these trips has been amazing. Thank you to everyone that already knows and has been helping silently. There are many of you that have provided prayer, hugs, dinners etc. This is the first time in my life i have been dealt something i can't ""handle"" on my own. I have learned a lot over this past year and continue to learn daily. first and foremost i have learned i need to lean on other people when i need them. Don’t be offended if I didn’t tell you about this. I shared this with few people hoping it would be a quick battle and i could tell my story when it was over. What can you do/How can you help:-I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP, IM TERRIBLE AT ASKING FOR HELP!-DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF MY KIDS!(they know but let me handle any discussions about it)-DON’T TREAT ME LIKE IM SICK(if you do, i may punch you in the throat and ask how you are This is a part of my story now, what it means to be Kirk Robinson, K-Rob, Kirky, Nino, hollywood, surfer boy or whatever you may call me. I wouldn't have picked this part of the story line, that's for sure. No sense being upset at the cards your dealt, just play them the best you can! I have met several people along this journey that i wouldn't have met otherwise. I am thankful for their support and their encouragement to share my story! Jim Brown, Ann Jarris Adam Throop, Melinda McKinley-throop, Rob Sweet and my ""text prayer group"". One group of people Monster and Sea heard my story through a friend and i found a card in my mailbox with some money to help us out. Timing could not have been better! I was so choked up that a group of people would want to help like this. It meant more than you can imagine!Please keep me and my family in your prayers! I know God has control over this. I pray daily that my eyes are open to the things around me and that i will be healed. I am a Blessed man, I am so lucky to have the family and friends that i do. I am thankful daily!HERES TO KICKING CANCERS ASS!!!!!

Medical,12,Help for special needs kid/moving,https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid,"MACON, GA","May 25, 2018","$75,000","$63,210","https://youtu.be/_Owd9bx-RCUHello, thank you for taking time to read my campaign for our son, David. Like any family, when our son hurts, we hurt. When my husband wakes up our son for school in the mornings it tears my soul apart when he tells me when I get home from work that David has vomited in his sleep because he had a seizure. The thought that he could have died right there in his bed is the worst possible nightmare that We could ever have and the fear of it becoming reality set us in motion to save our son. A kind service dog has eased, but not erased the worry and dread by standing guard of him and being able to detect and alert to the oncoming seizures so  that my husband can now half way sleep knowing that he will hear her cries for help when David’s voice is gone.The Doctors tried him on many medications (some all at once) to try and stop the seizures as he was having them daily. These medications almost cost him his life just because of their chemical nature. We trusted these Doctors that their medical expertise with these medications were in David’s best interest, past my own knowledge, my husband researched them and wow the side effects, and then watched these dangerous chemicals that are prescribed in good faith have a different chemical reaction in our son that could not have been foreseen, the seizures got worse, our son has fought many times for his life with Doctors fighting to bring him back and keep him here. David has a service dog, seizures, seizure medications, and Doctors. What he doesn’t have is the ability to be a child because the seizures have stolen his childhood from him. He cannot even ride his bike to the park with friends. What would happen if he had a seizure crossing the street? He cannot go to school and enjoy when he is so tired and recovering from days of seizures to the point he was going to have to be isolated even more and taught at home. David cannot just go be a kid with his friends because “What if this is THE seizure that We have been tearing our hearts and brains  apart to stop, and prayerfully begging that never comes. Neither of us can protect him in his own bed, let alone away from home. His dog helps detect and alert, but she would not be able to render the medical care that he would need. We would have to just trust that some stranger would recognize it, and call for help. Also hope that someone driving the street where he fell did not look down at the radio, or to another distraction for a split second and hit David or Malory. Can any father or mother  in good faith trust their child’s life to the hands of potential strangers? If a parent did, would they have their child’s best interest? Are we really doing the right thing by imprisoning him for any reason and watching his childhood pass him by? How do We keep from hating ourselves because we are supposed to be able to fix this and protect him? What can We do? Nobody can save our son, and neither of us are willing to accept letting him go, or his innocence of catching lightening bugs and bringing me a wilted flower that he had in his pocket for an hour or the dead bug to his dad that he accidentally sat on die in our faces. His eyes search us for help, and we have none.In February 2018, after my husband did some researching and wrestling with the idea, asking myself about the law, the thought of giving something illegal to our child that was for our entire childhood “a bad and dangerous drug,” we started treating him with Marijuana. Unfortunately it is still illegal here in Georgia. We had plans and hopes of getting him on a good track with school, and referred out of state to better and broader medical practices. We both demanded to know what is going into our child, and while we did everything we could to know, neither of us had any legal access to a Doctor’s experience with different kinds. We knew the risks that we read, the medical research that We both had to pour over for hours fighting what is right/legal/safe/moral, I informed all of his medical team because we wanted our son to be safe. I was not advised to stop treating him this way along with safer medications from the Doctor. The Doctor did not comment exactly why, but I think she wanted to see for herself. The combination granted our son 71 days seizure FREE!!!!! For 71 days our son rode his bike, woke up, went to school, played with friends, played outside, and the terror for his life that gripped our hearts and souls began to lift. The smiles on our faces reflecting our child getting to be a normal child. Safe in his bed. Doing better in school. Having a great quality of life. We were breaking the law. We saved our son. We were fixing the fragments the best way we could of him being that little boy that was taken away from him by these seizures. This is our job as parents, to protect our child even with our own lives. As I wrote above, I kept his medical team up to date. As we felt we had found his miracle, and anyone else who saw his medical history would see this too. We also felt like his entire medical team truly cared for him and wanted the same things we did, and with honesty on my part and his safety forefront of every visit, we were winning. This transparency also meant informing a new therapist who did not share our joys or beliefs that allowing him access to marijuana was worth this new life he had begun. I was reported to DCFS, and on April 19, 2018 their representatives along with deputy sheriff’s entered our home with our cooperation and full truth of what and why, and despite the evidence, demanded that I stop “abusing” our son by giving him this “dangerous” marijuana. Allowing him to have debilitating seizures that threaten his life and any quality of that life was quite okay as long as he was not using marijuana. They did not even apply his medical team’s observations and findings to their opinions. If you are unsure what is worse, look up seizure medication side effects. Then look up medical research for marijuana usage as seizure treatment. Compare the two with success rates, side effects, birth defects that are known, long term effects that are known, what class of drug they are in by abuscability, pretend David is your child, and tell us honestly that following the law, but risking his life is better than trying something that is illegal, but with mountains of medical data as to it’s worth as a treatment to the point on becoming legal in certain states. We stood behind our decision to save our son’s life even though we had not made the move yet, and openly admitted to allowing him to use it for the treatment of his seizures. We have never lied about where he got it, or our intentions. The DCFS demanded that we cease this immediately. Against our better judgement, we did. They were not there for the times my husband had to drag our son to the truck because it takes 45 minutes for help to arrive. They were not there for the times that we carried him out of the house to break the traffic laws to get him the help he so desperately needed. They were not there to see my husband loose several jobs because we were rushing our son to get medical help. They were not there when we spent almost 3 months in an emergency room everyday because our son was being transported because he’d done had another seizure either at home or at school, or that 2 weeks out of those 3 months was spent at a hospital in Atlanta begging the doctors to take him off the medication that was killing him. There was no way we could afford to get him to a state that could help him fast enough to stop what we both knew was coming and even told the DCFS representative and officer. Even working two jobs as I do and the 4 that my husband does. There was a small hope that once they could see his seizures returning, and his Doctor’s recommendations that they would see we were not any of those other types of the parents that they see so often it hardens their hearts to only seeing laws and what the state deems acceptable parenting. Maybe they would allow me just enough time to get him to the help of a medical center in an appropriate state. Within14 hours of the marijuana being stopped without consulting his Doctor, even with the safer seizure medications still administered, his service dog was alerting my husband as I was filling out paperwork for the DCFS office, David’s eyes filled with dread, fear, and hopelessness as all Matthew could do was watch it happen and get him to the hospital, and before my heart could even beat, he was in the grips of this horrible, evil, monster that threatens his life again. We felt sure they would see now. We felt sure they would not be able to ignore the obvious and blatant evidence in front of their faces, and the loss of childhood in our son’s face. This was not correct. While our son fought for his life, officially in DCFS custody and flatlining 15 times according to medical records, my husband was arrested, they tore me from my baby’s side and told me they were going to take custody of him as I was arrested too. They say he is not safe with us while a medical team tries to start his heart again because they have stopped his treatment by what they know of the law and their opinion. Then by opinion of the hospital’s police staff, my son’s service dog was removed and put into the city pound without allowing me the federally mandated, and legally protected, reasonable amount of time to seek someone to take custody of her. The officer from what I understand of the service dog laws outlined by the ADA website, violated federal law that protects these working animals and their handlers. We broke a state law in hopes of saving my son. In turn, our son’s federal rights as protected under the ADA laws were violated because of ignorance of what the laws state regarding service animal identification, and the federal laws dictating how a service dog with an incapacitated handler must be treated. How do we at the least help this department repair their ignorance of the federal laws? I asked people who advocate for the understanding of laws concerning service animals if I was incorrect in what I read. They explained what the laws state for each thing specifically that happened. They cannot legally tell me who was right or wrong as we all have a right to tell our own side of every story without the assumption of guilt. On my own reporting, I did, in fact, understand the laws that I believe were violated. I now have an obligation to become an advocate myself when our son is back in our arms and living his beautiful, young life.She is our son’s link to the conscious world when he is trapped in the grips of those seizures and cannot cry for help himself. She is his voice, his hero, and his Angel. She has a job that has improved all of our lives from him choking on his own vomit in his sleep because she will make sure someone hears her and gets to him. Instead of being treated as a valuable life and life saving dog, she was thrown into her own type of prison for 7 days. “Actually innocent, but decidedly guilty based on ignorance of the law” is what I would name that kind of charge. Seven days this life saving animal went without anyone she knew, strange foods, strange scheduling, strange dogs (who knows if they were friendly or not), exposure to a myriad of diseases, and was treated like an animal thrown away.  Vaccinations are our first line defense, but they do, on occasion fail our dogs. She risks that when she leaves our house. Just as we risk being attacked by a shark if we swim in the ocean. We know the risk, and that is why we do not jump into known, high shark activity laden waters with an open wound. Pounds cannot help except to be a possible breeding ground for diseases. They must house stray dogs whether they know the histories of the dogs or not. They cannot deny going and picking up a dog reported just because they do not know if it has had vaccinations. They can quarantine if equipped for that, and if the pound has adequate space and vet staff. Our son’s service dog is priceless in alerting to get David help, and she was cast aside just like our son’s childhood and quality of life. She has this way that is unique to them to speak to his whole mind and assure him that he is going to open his eyes to her again. She is amazing, and deserves to always be treated as such. We do not want to risk losing the only link we have to him to assure him that Matt and mommy are fighting for him when he cannot see and hear us. This wonderful, furry, angel tells him so. She wants her boy back almost as much as we do.Because of all of this, we want to move our child and family to a state with the medical resources to help him. We have found a lawyer who is the best of the best. She has reviewed and has been very optimistic in her ability to help us get our son back, and move him to a place where he can be monitored with regulated, specially grown marijuana that is designed to treat his individual needs uniquely. Our son deserves life. I am asking for help to save our son. Please donate if you are able so that we can hire this attorney and save him. If you are unable to donate, please understand that we are in deepest appreciation of prayers for our son to be okay and be a little boy riding his bike, and looking forward to going to school again, and so proud and excited when he learns new things and makes good grades. This just hurts so badly. We feel so afraid for him, and everything in both of us cries and screams to save him. We do not know if he is being cared for like a child or a case number. We only hear things that bother us deeply, and all we can do is turn it over to the lawyer to now fight the greatest battle of our lives in having our heart returned to us safe and sound and knowing that we now know the correct path of helping him, and can do this the legal way. It has proven to be the correct way by the medical evidence of only 71 days alone. Please, help us if you are able. We only want our baby back and to see him play and grow without fear of these seizures that were stealing him away from us before he was taken away by DCFS. We want all of him back, and have proven that we will do anything to protect him. The difference is that now, we are educating ourselves on the correct way, and imagining an even better outcome for his health with the proper care.Thank You! https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid?sharetype=teams&member=227462&rcid=r01-152732054834-745a05a4a60247a6&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m",988,2.5k,20,959,3 months,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She has an amazing story below, having already survived a previously incurable cancer. Please share her story with your social networks so we can raise awareness! We would deeply appreciate you helping her to write a happy ending, again. *** “For nearly as long as I can remember I have referred to Lexi Thomas as my sister. While she is technically my sister-in-law, that couldn’t matter less. She is a light in the world.” I first wrote those words 19 months ago, well before we could have known how Lexi’s journey would unfold. Lexi had been diagnosed with a cancer so rare that it had never been seen in a living patient, and after four years of fighting to stay alive, we found that we needed to raise thousands of dollars very quickly to get her into a high-risk, high-reward clinical trial. That trial was to be her last chance at life, culminating in a “reaction” that would either cause her death, or she would live and be cured.  With the help of more than 500 amazing individual donors we raised the money in time, got Lexi into the trial, and prayed for a miracle. On November 7th, her reaction came. Surrounded by her doctors from NIH, Duke and John’s Hopkins, her brain swelled, her heart stopped, and she died. For twenty long minutes, she was gone. But, we got our miracle. With a Herculean effort from her doctors, she fought to come back to us, and months later we found out that she had indeed beaten the previously incurable cancer. Not only did Lexi come back to us, she came back whole, and with a purpose. In the year that followed, more than 10,000 people, many of them young adults living with cancer, became readers of Lexi’s blog. The National Cancer Institute honored her with their “Young Adult of Great Influence” Award at the Angel Ball in New York City, and she got a boyfriend, of whom we all totally approve. Please check out her blog here if you would like to learn more about her story:  https://lexthomas11.wordpress.com We have started this new GoFundMe because while the incurable cancer remains beaten, Lexi again finds herself struggling to survive, this time fighting an aggressive new lymphoma that sprang up seemingly out of nowhere. As of this writing, she has been given 4-6 months to live if she doesn’t get treatment, and she’s again fighting like hell to stay with us, applying to every trial she might fit.  After being rejected from 211 trials in just the last nine months, lucky number 212 said yes! Now we have to raise the money to get her into this highly effective, and much safer immunotherapy trial. As before, this is likely her last chance at life, and we very much need to ask for your help again to beat this. In order to get into the trial, Lexi needs to start a new chemotherapy just a few weeks from now to keep her tumors from progressing. Radiation therapy has burned her too badly, and so this chemotherapy is her last option. The cost for the trial is a staggering $180,000. Fortunately, she only needs to put down a downpayment of $18,000 to start, but this does not count her bagged nutrition which costs $1,974 a week, her IV antibiotics, her hyperbaric chamber therapy to treat her radiation burns, and a litany of other expenses. Her medical debt now exceeds $300,000, but for now we want to raise $75,000 to get her into the trial and cover her critcial medical expenses for the next several months. Two years ago this community came together and helped to save Lexi’s life. She’s ready to fight again, and we need to ask you to help us make one more miracle for this young woman who has so powerfully touched so many lives. Please consider supporting this urgent goal, and make sure to share this campaign on your social networks. People often wonder if charitable campaigns are real, and it really, really helps to have folks who know and care about Lexi letting the world know that she is real, the need is real, and that they have a great opportunity to give the gift of life. Your support would mean the world to Lexi, and to our family. #lexistrong",738,1.0k,6,745,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

This diagnosis was the culmination of our attempts to find a solution to months of breastfeeding issues. Needless to say, it was unexpected.God’s care and favor has already been evident. In the week since diagnosis, Stephany has been able to meet with specialists and oncologists - a process that usually takes weeks, not days. Perhaps most notable is that Stephany and I were able to gain admission to a clinic that specializes in immunotherapy and holistic treatment of cancers, just two days after we received her diagnosis. This clinic has very high success rates when treating breast cancer. God’s favor in this cannot be understated; an appointment like this usually takes 2-3 months to secure.Please be in sustained prayer for Stephany, me, and our family as we journey down the long road of treatment and healing. Cancer diagnoses are never easy. But we know God. He has already done so much for us in this time, and we know he will continue to carry Stephany moving forward. We feel blessed to know we are surrounded by faith-filled, bible-practicing, Godly people, who are helping us to in our time of need. And because of people like you, we know that we don’t have anything to be anxious about as we work towards Stephany’s recovery.There’s certainly more that could be said, but for now I wanted to post to share with everyone and to ask for prayer. We will continue to share updates throughout this process.We love and are thankful for everyone and their support during this season.

-----------------------From Team Steph:The cancer that Steph has been diagnosed with is very aggressive. According to the Oncologist, the reason the cancer was not discovered any earlier was due to Steph breastfeeding her newborn, making detection incredibly challenging. Steph went from thinking she merely had mastitis to a full blown Stage IV Breast Cancer diagnosis. The reason it is stage IV is because it has spread to her lymphatic system, bones, liver, and lungs. The Oncologist wanted to start chemotherapy as soon as possible (apparently the person who installs the port for chemotherapy was on a vacation, so Steph wouldn’t be able to begin for another week). The Oncologist also wanted to put Steph in an immunotherapy, clinical trial, because he saw she was a good candidate for such recourse.Along with her Primary Care Physician, husband, and other counsel, Steph decided she wanted to further explore the immunotherapy approach. With the help of friends, the Dailey’s were able to hone it down to 3 specific clinics who were both reputable and experienced with this particular kind of cancer. Receiving her Stage IV diagnosis on Thursday morning, by Friday night Steph had two phone consultations with two different clinic doctors, and on Saturday was given a spot at the most reputable and successful of the clinics (the only of the clinics to have 3 American Certified Surgeon Oncologist on Staff and on location) - she would be able to move in and bring her newborn and husband that Sunday afternoon. Her treatment would begin with 20 intensive days as an in-patient. This hospital does a fusion of alternative and conventional forms of treatment, and her exact therapies and medicines would be prescribed upon arrival. They will take baseline measurements, including tumor markers to track progress. Chemo is still a likely possibility. She would then return home with a potent regimen of vitamins, meals, and other cancer treatment pharmaceuticals. Then she would return for a 7 day intensive to follow up, including retaking tumor markers, and then the Doctors would be able to suggest the next course of action. Because the clinic allowed Steph admission so quickly, the Dailey’s were not able to secure the funds in time, so rather than delaying until money was raised, the cost was negotiated to be paid with a deposit on a credit card (to be paid back through fundraising, God willing) and to have a future, upcoming payment to continue treatment (including the home regimen and 7 day follow up) due approximately 2 weeks from now - August 31st, 2018. On behalf of Steph, we are asking for a total of $50,000. $35,000 is for the 20 days of intensive in-patient treatment, plus the robust 3-month home therapy regimen, and the 7 day in-patient follow up back at the clinic. Another $5,000 is for the travel cost and related incidentals, roundtrip to the clinic both times. $10,000 is for other cancer treatment related costs while she’s at home for 3 months in between clinic stays, broken down to about $100 per day. This includes being able to switch the Dailey family over to non-toxic household products, and other related approaches to having a toxic free home. There are likely other costs, but at this time it is unpredictable as to what they would be considering how early Steph is into the treatment. However, this amount will be able to give the Dailey’s a sense of security related to their finances and keep Steph receiving the treatment she so desperately needs. If you can donate frequent flyer miles to help with travel, or have access to other resources for cancer patients, please contact us and let us know!Please join us in “Saving Steph.” Pray with us. Generously give with us.

Medical,13,Lauren's Killing Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/lauren039s-killing-cancer-fund,"WEST PALM BEACH, FL","July 25, 2018","$75,000","$62,025","Many of you are familiar with my business partner and my best friend, Lauren Greaves.  For those of you who don’t know Lauren well… She is firecracker. Gorgeous.  Funniest human I know.  A hot mess most days (in a good way), a super loyal friend, a blessed sister, daughter, aunt and all around crazy-awesome human being.  I for one, am blessed to have her in my life and I will do whatever I can do to KILL HER CANCER!  She is one of those friends who we all pray we find.  She is the type of friend who you can rely on and the one who always answers her phone at any hour of the day or night…. The one human in your life who will always deliver you pizza (or wine) at 2AM because that is ALL you need at that very moment to keep your sanity.  She is that person to me but also to countless others.  She is the best person I know.  Surprisingly, in May 2018, Lauren was diagnosed with cancer.  Aggressive Cancer.  The story:Two years ago, by way of self-examination, Lauren noticed a small lump on her breast. As an active 31-year-old, she thought little of it, but decided to do the prudent thing and visit the doctor for a consultation. After a brief examination, she was casually informed that the area of concern was in fact, benign, and there was nothing to worry about. So, Lauren went on living her life as she normally did, that is, until May of 2018… During what was intended to be a routine check-up, Lauren mentioned to her doctor that she felt like the benign lump had grown since her last visit. Shortly thereafter, she was thrown into a series of scans, tests, pokes and prods in an effort to determine what the growth was and why it had changed so drastically. Anyone who has been even remotely suspected of having cancer can attest to the fact that the following days/ weeks searching for a definitive conclusion can be the most grueling and mentally challenging as the prognosis seemingly changes minute by minute.  All that said, on May 15th, Lauren was diagnosed with Stage 3 Invasive Intraductal Carcinoma of the right breast. Beyond this, her cancer is “aggressive,” having already manifested itself in her lymph nodes. Should it continue beyond her lymph nodes, the doctors would deem it metastatic, or simply put, a death sentence. However, she is “lucky,” and her diagnosis, albeit Stage 3, is treatable. While the prognosis is optimistic, Lauren still has a long road ahead of her. Her killing-cancer journey begins with 8 rounds of an aggressive form of Chemotherapy (AC-T) AKA “The Red Devil.”  Her treatment started July 12thand will continue bi-weekly until late October. From there, she is allotted a brief two-week “vacation” from the drugs to heal, then a scan to make sure there was in fact a reduction in the size of tumors and then onto prep for her impending Double Mastectomy and Lymph Node Removal. Following those procedures, she will undergo Phase 1 of Reconstruction, immediately followed by 30 rounds of Radiation. After radiation, the second phase of reconstruction commences and if all goes according to plan, Lauren will be on the road to recovery by late spring 2019. In the meantime, her doctors have begun preparing her for full loss of hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, and even possibly fingernails and toenails. An additional bi-product of the chemotherapy is typically extensive damage to the ovaries and eggs.  Since Lauren has not had children of her own (YET), over the past 8 weeks she has been attempting to freeze her eggs in hopes of possibly, one day, having a biological child. Sadly, during the process, she was also diagnosed with a condition called DOR, or Diminished Ovarian Reserves, meaning she doesn’t have many eggs to freeze. She reluctantly delayed her chemo in order to try and squeeze in a second round of IVF, as the first round was less than fruitful. Although insurance covers infertility for men, it does NOT cover infertility for women, even with a Cancer diagnosis (BANANAS! Can you imagine this nonsense?). Each round is between $15,000 - $18,000. As her Cancer is estrogen-based, Lauren will also be induced into menopause at the age of 33 and remain there for at least 10 years in hopes of deterring the cancer from returning. Menopause is no-joke for a 50+ year old woman but for a robust 33 year old… I can’t express to you the mental anguish.  Trust me, this is NOT something any woman wants to face, especially NOT Lauren! My goal with this Go-Fund-Me page is help Lauren pay off her egg retrievals (which she already owes $32,000) but also help her fund some of the cancer-killing treatments.  Although Lauren is employed and Sarah and I will work our tails off to make sure she has a steady income, she will be working less and obviously taking in less income for the next 1-2 years.  Additionally, Lauren has less than desirable insurance and I would love to be able to help her pay some of her insurmountable medical bills.   Anything you can to help Lauren, ANY AMOUNT BIG OR SMALL is much appreciated and will not go unnoticed.    Sincerely and with much love and appreciation,Sabra Kirkpatrick and Sarah Koenig",325,1.1k,10,322,1 month,9 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

It is hard to believe that we are writing this about the situation facing our good friend Duncan Campling and his family.Duncan is 47 years old, & at the prime of his life, suffered a devastating Brain Stem Stroke on March 15, 2018. The news about Duncan is very  hard to comprehend, because he was healthy, going on about with his life and suddenly he had a stroke and was hospitalized in critical condition in the intensive care Unit.We have launched this GoFundMe campaign because this situation has a huge financial impact on Duncan and his young family; both in terms of covering the costs of his long-term care and his ability to provide for his family. Duncan needs our support. The simple facts are that this devastating ‘brain-stem stroke’ has left him in a long-term state of almost total incapacity. His medical care team is labeling his condition as “Locked-In syndrome”, which among other things means he has severe paralysis and is currently only able to communicate via eye and head movement. Duncan has full cognitive function and is fully aware of his situation. He has been moved from the hospital ICU to an Acute Therapy Hospital in suburban Philadelphia.Duncan has been an amazing and reliable friend to many people for so many years. We all know Duncan as gregarious, adventurous, full of life, easy to talk to, quick to laugh and make others laugh, generous and always one to pitch in and help whenever needed. More importantly Duncan has been an amazing husband to Veronica and loving father to Brent, 7 yrs old and Jason, 5 yrs old.Due to the severe and ongoing nature of Duncan's condition, there is serious concern about the costs involved in his long-term care as his insurance options start to diminish. We have set up this ‘gofundme’ page to help Duncan, Veronica, Brent and Jason for two reasons: -        To raise funds to address Duncan’s long-term care needs and provide supplementary aid for his family during this period of transition.-        To raise funds for medical equipment that will help Duncan regain as much independence as possible during recovery. Duncan needs among others specific technology such as an eye-tracking computer system to allow communication and a specialized, motorized wheelchair. Duncan is a fighter and has been intensely focused and determined to regain function through intensive therapy. With your support, we are hopeful that he will make progress towards a positive and fulfilling future.Together, Let's fight for Duncan!

(He is my husband's nephew, but in reality he is more like a brother to both of us, someone we spend the majority of our weekends with on the lake, in the woods and around the campfire.)  Dan has been an active outdoorsman his entire life, spending nearly all of his spare time camping, fishing, hunting, boating and enjoying life with his fiance and best friend, Ashley, as well as his family and friends. Everywhere Dan goes he has his two young children, Natalee and Nicholas, in his arms or attached to his hip. A highly productive individual, he is an extremely valued employee and a foreman with our company. Honest, hard-working and loyal, Dan is absolutely irreplaceable. He is smart, practical, independent and motivated, and he is admired, loved and respected by everyone around him. Dan has always, always been ready and willing at any given moment to help his family and friends ( and even strangers) no matter their needs or situations.The accident.On March 20, 2018 Dan was performing his job duties as a mechanical insulator, installing pipe insulation on piping located approximately 20' above ground. Working out of a scissor lift with a platform, he extended to reach a section of pipe when he lost his balance and fell to the dirt and gravel floor below. Upon impact with the ground he suffered multiple broken ribs, a punctured lung, a broken scapula, and burst fractures of his T9 and T10 vertebrae.Diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.Dan was immediately transported to UPMC Hamot and has undergone surgery to stabilize his spine. He will endure another surgery to repair his scapula before he is transferred to an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh on or around March 28.Dan has suffered a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) below the vertebral fracture sites, effectively losing all feeling and movement below the middle of his abdomen. The neurosurgeon has indicated that his paralysis is permanent.Upon transfer from the ICU in Hamot to the acute rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh, he will endure an intense 4-6 week therapy program to prepare him for his return home.Dan's life after SCIDan will have a team of physicians and therapists in Pittsburgh that he will be visiting frequently after his release from the rehab program. Additionally, Dan will continue outpatient rehabilitation closer to home.It is Dan's goal that he will return to many, if not all, of his previous hobbies as well as work in the future. His family and friends have been working tirelessly since the accident to assemble a solid support system to help him reach his goals.Dan will need renovations to his home. However, even with these changes, his current home will not be able to serve as his permanent home. There are an abundance of safety issues and there is no way to adequately expand the home to provide him the space he needs.In addition to the impending struggles of trying to adjust to their new life, especially with two young children, Dan and Ashley will need a new ADA-designed and equipped home in the near future.How can Dan's family and friends help?Dan, Ashley and their family are grateful to the innumerable amount of people who have reached out to them asking how they can help. After much careful thought, assistance toward a safe and comfortable home has been determined to be the greatest need. Preliminarily, they have every intention to stay as close as possible to their immediate family. We are hoping that we can alleviate some of the burden that comes with such a major life change and help them with a home that fits their family's new needs.There are no words to express how thankful we all are for your thoughtfulness, your compassion, your contributions and your willingness to support Dan, Ashley, Natalee and Nicholas.",242,811,3,235,5 months,4 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Doctors were able to eradicate 3 of the tumors with Gamma Knife radiosurgery but the 4th tumor was too large for Gamma Knife and required brain surgery.  I had brain surgery, started taking targeted therapy medication and went back to living my life for the next 10 months until the medication stopped working.  New scans showed that I had 3 new brain tumors.  Doctors treated these tumors with Gamma Knife, discontinued the targeted therapy medication and put me on immunotherapy infusions.  A few months into this and one of the tumors that had been previously treated started to enlarge; I had to have a 2nd brain surgery.In the summer of 2016, a few months after my 2nd brain surgery, scans showed that melanoma was now in my spine.  I had radiation and started on a clinical trial.  Within months, I started experiencing back pain.  Cancer had returned to my spine and I needed surgery.  After the surgery, I experienced a major complication; my intestines perforated and I almost died.  I had to have emergency surgery and an ileostomy.  If you don’t know what an ileostomy is, trust me, it was awful.  With this complication, I could not be on any cancer treatment and so in early 2017, the cancer returned to my spine and I had to have my 2nd spine surgery and 2nd round of radiation.  A few months later, I had surgery to get rid of my ileostomy; which was great but I’m still not the same, at least as far as my guts are concerned.Whenever I meet a new doctor who has seen my chart but never met me, they are always surprised.  They tell me that I look a lot better in person than I do on paper and that I am lucky to be alive.  I have a tremendous support team.  My wife Dana has been by my side every step of the way and I truly don’t think I would be alive if it weren’t for her.  She is amazing.This past few weeks have been rough.  My most recent scans show a new tumor in my brain and enlarging tumors in my spine and lymph node.  I will have Gamma Knife tomorrow to take care of the tumor in my brain.As for my spine, the surgeons and radiologists that I have consulted with are concerned that a 3rd surgery or 3rd dose of radiation to my spine could cause permanent damage.  My radiologist has referred me to Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York.  MSK recommends proton therapy as the safest way to alleviate the tumor on my spine.  Unfortunately, my insurance does not agree and has deemed this as “not medically necessary”.  “Not medically necessary” Hearing these words has been shocking and stressful.  Up until now, insurance has always paid their part and I have always paid mine.  I will appeal this decision, but in the meantime, a big part of what has kept me alive so far is moving forward based on the recommendations of experts.  I will not let this slow me down and am moving forward.  I have my initial appointment at the proton therapy center on Friday.As for the lymph node, my oncologist has referred me to MD Anderson in Houston where I would have surgery to remove the lymph node and hopefully will be a candidate for their TIL program – more on that later as we are still working on getting this moving.  When I sat down to write this, I didn’t intend for it to be so long.  But then I guess it has been a long journey. We’ve had so many friends and family help us with childcare, meals, shoveling snow, mowing our grass, praying and taking the time to ask how I am doing.  People Dana and I didn’t really know at the start of this have stood by our side and have become our best friends.  The support we have received has made all the difference.  Now as the cancer is progressing, and we are having to travel out of state to get the medical care I need, Dana and I are dealing with coordinating three different hospitals in three different states, travel, insurance, child care, missing work.   We are overwhelmed, scared and stressed.  A family member reminded me that there are many people out there who don’t live close but have asked what they can do - they can’t bring me dinner or watch my kids, but want to help – so, if you are one of those people, maybe you could help with this and check back every once in a while, to see how I am doing  My family:Some pictures from 2009:Gamma Knife Radiosurgery - this is what I have to look forward to tomorrow!After brain surgery - the baseball team I help coach signed this bat for me:)This was my first of many infusions!More surgeries:",254,439,9,255,2 months,12 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

I am a happy, fun loving boy who enjoys being around my family and playing with my friends. Some of my favorite activities include playing with trains, swimming in my new pool, and learning at school. On April 3rd, 2018 I was watching my favorite show when I began having a seizure. My mommy saw me having a seizure and called 911. They rushed me to the hospital where they began doing many tests including a scan of my head where they found a mass on my brain. This came as a major shock to my mommy and daddy. The doctors found that the mass on my brain was a tumor that needed to be operated on. On April 10th, I had brain surgery to remove the tumor and the doctors thought it looked “funny”. They sent it away to John Hopkins Children’s Hospital , St. Jude Children’s Research, and The University Stanford to identify what the tumor was. Unfortunately, it was determined that my tumor was in deed cancerous and of high grade. The doctors said that my tumor is Grade 4, Highly Aggressive Embryonal Cancer. As you could imagine, this broke mommy and daddy’s heart and made us all very scared. We don’t know what to expect, but we are hoping and praying for the best. The doctors said that I am going to need to undergo chemo therapy. There is a 65% chance that this cancer can be treated with chemo therapy, but 35% chance it can return. I am going to be going through 3-6 months of high dose chemo therapy to help stop the cancer from returning. The doctors say that I am going to be very sick as the chemo therapy is going to cause me to lose my hair, appetite and strength. I don't really understand what is going on, but I know mommy and daddy do and I can see that they are very scared. I am going to be staying at Jack Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami until I am better. Daddy is going to be supporting us by traveling back and forth to work and the hospital to be with me and mommy. Mommy is going to be with me around the clock and wont be able to work. As I go through this challenging next 3-6 month, I ask for your prayers to help me stay strong and for this cancer to never come back. I can't wait to be able to jump in my pool, play with my trains at home, and play with my friends once I get through this chemo therapy. I ask that you please help mommy and daddy in any way you can. They will be short income from mommy not being able to work and the medical bills they will have to deal with from me being sick.

Brother Natnael lost his father when he was 2 years old. Since his mother was unable to raise 3 boys by herself, she had to let Natnael live with his aunt. Life was very tough for him growing up. He lived through unbearable stress and physical abuse. He later developed a brain tumor that doctors believed caused by stress. He lost his vision because of the brain tumor. Doctors in Ethiopia don't have the means to perform this type of surgery. There is a hope for this young man to get his vision back but the procedure has to be done outside of Ethiopia. The family don’t have the means to cover the medical and travel expenses so we initially established this gofundme account to send Nathy to India for the procedure but with your overwhelming donations and support Nathy now has the opportunity to come to USA . We have currently raised $36,432 and need to get to 50,000.00.

Medical,15,Help my mom fight brain cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/5csg4-help-my-mom-fight-brain-cancer,"LOS ANGELES, CA","July 18, 2018","$100,000","$61,533","On June 18th, 2018 — the day after my last graduation ceremony — my mother was rushed to the ER after excruciating migraines that left her unable to walk and talk. Shortly after, we received the devastating diagnosis that she had an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor. Now, she is fighting for her life against stage IV brain cancer.


My Mom’s Story

For more than ten years, my mom worked as a restaurant waitress to single-handedly provide for our family of six. She regularly clocked over 100 hours a week and rarely took any time off in the decade that she spent waiting tables for thousands of customers. She taught herself the little English that she knows from memorizing menu items and took immense pride in being able to bring joy to people’s lives by serving them delicious food. For as long as I can remember, my mother’s always been a fighter. When my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare blood condition with no cure called hemophilia, she quickly learned from nurses how to inject medication to allow him to live a normal life. When my father was repeatedly incarcerated for domestic violence and drug addiction, she found ways to provide us safe, healthy, and nurturing environments to grow up in. My mother has survived homelessness and food insecurity, abuse and assault, and all while raising two kids and caring for her aging parents. Above all else, she’s modeled resilience, strength, and positivity in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Now, she’s facing what she considers to be just another hurdle to overcome: cancer. What HappenedMy family saved money for months to be able to afford to attend my graduation weekend at UCLA. My mom was especially excited — it was her first real vacation in years and it was also her first time visiting California. However, throughout their stay, she began to experience increasingly aggressive migraines that left her bedridden. For years, my mom has had regular headaches and bouts of forgetfulness, but we always thought that it was from her overworking herself at the restaurant.After she was sent to the ER, we learned that these weren’t normal signs of exhaustion; they were symptoms of an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor called glioblastoma, which has a five-year survival rate of just 5%.Once my mom was admitted to the hospital, doctors found that her tumor had grown so much that brain matter that should have been in the middle of her head had been pushed all the way to one side. Neurosurgeons had to place a shunt in her brain to relieve the pressure of the swollen mass. In the last month, her condition has quickly deteriorated; she’s been put on breathing tubes, her muscles have withered away, and she's been put on an intense regime of steroids, antibiotics, and other medication.The Road AheadMy mom has always been vigorously active, from working as a physical education teacher in China to dashing between tables as a waitress in Michigan. She’ll be transitioning from a fiercely independent lifestyle to one where she’ll need assistance with simple tasks like using the restroom and brushing her teeth. The initial bill that we received after only one week of hospitalization was almost $148,000. This amount has since tripled and is still growing. Because my mom is not a California resident, we’ve faced immense challenges with enrolling her for any form of emergency health insurance or financial support, even with the help of social workers and financial counselors.We’re extremely fortunate that she was able to undergo a partial tumor removal surgery at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. This intensive procedure removed a piece of the tumor that was the size of a hand. Now, she’ll need extensive physical and speech therapy, as well as months ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. If we’re lucky, she’ll be able to qualify for clinical trials. All of these amount to significant out-of-pocket costs. As the only immediate family member besides my sixteen-year-old brother who can speak fluent English and drive, I’ll be my mother’s primary caregiver in the months (and, hopefully, years) to come. I’ve decided to put my dream of attending law school on the backburner because our priority now is to give my mom the best life possible with the best treatment possible. It’s a daunting task, but one that I also consider an honor: to be able to take care of the person who has protected and nurtured us through some of life’s roughest storms. But to be honest, I can’t do this alone. In addition to overseeing my mom’s medical needs, I’ll also be caring for my elderly grandparents, raising my brother and helping him with applying to college in the fall, paying for our living expenses, finishing up classes for my degree, and completing a fellowship.Sometimes, it almost feels like too much. There’s nothing more terrifying than watching the person you love most slowly wither away before your eyes. This last month has been the most challenging time of my life and my biggest fear is that my mom won’t be able to get the care she needs because we can’t afford to foot the medical bill, or don’t have the money to get gas for the car. I’ve spent days writing and rewriting this plea for help. Any amount of support, whether it’s a single dollar or sharing this GoFundMe, would be immensely appreciated by my family.Thank you for helping me give my mom a fighting chance.",1.7k,2.5k,2,"1,708",1 month,14 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is a light in this world that needs our help to shine as bright as she possibly can.Sara’s doctors are recommending 4 concurrent treatments to win this fight. In addition to that, Sara is incorporating treatments that will attack the cancer in a progressive way. All of these treatments will be costly. Sara has some protection in place with a Critical Illness rider on one of her life policies.

The challenges of this have furthered my appreciation for friendship, family, community, and heightened my view of what we do every day to help one another. I will be forever grateful for the thoughtfulness and support I have received. Although it is challenging for me to accept contributions to my recovery, I resolve to pay back this generosity tenfold. If there is one objective in my time left in this world, it will be to give back and inspire.

Medical,15,Viorel Nitica Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/ViorelNiticaMedicalFund,"West Chester, PA","April 15, 2018","$150,000","$63,861","My name is Ana Nitica and I am creating this GoFundMe campaign on behalf of my beloved husband of almost 32 years, Viorel Nitica, at the urging of our family, friends, colleagues, and many people whose lives he has touched.  Viorel has been diagnosed with glioblastoma and the insurance denied coverage for the proton radiation treatment that his doctor prescribed.  Together, we raised two wonderful sons and overcame numerous challenges, some of which were very serious.  Viorel took good care of his family, he enjoyed traveling and the trips at the amazing Longwood Gardens, and working.  Viorel dedicated most of his life to his research and teaching work, contributing a lot to the success of the Department of Mathematics at West Chester University of Pennsylvania where he is a Full Professor of Mathematics with tenure and taught more than 30 different courses.  He is spoken about very highly by his colleagues and students alike.  Viorel authored about 70 research papers, some of them published in prestigious mathematical journals, published two books, participated and gave talks at conferences in many countries, and did reviewer work for many scientific journals. Viorel received two National Science Foundation grants and received the prestigious Trustees Achievement Award from West Chester University.On February 25, 2018, I took Viorel to Chester County hospital because he suffered of headaches during the previous week, which became almost unbearable.  The hospital did a CAT-scan of Viorel’s brain and found a large abnormal deviation in the brain that can cause life threatening intracranial pressure and immediately transported him to the University of Pennsylvania Hospital for more testing and treatment. MRI tests revealed a tumor of diameter between 5 and 6 cm in his brain.On March 1st, more than 95 percent of the tumor was removed, and the surgeon found that it is was glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. We were in shock and took a long time for this to sink in.  The statistics for this are very gloomy, and we proceeded to learned more about it.  In addition to surgery, the treatment also requires radiation and chemotherapy that reduce the chance for a recurrent tumor, which is high.  Even more shocking was the news that because of the size of his tumor and the location, and the nature of the radiation (photon therapy), the treatment would likely leave him disabled in many ways, by damaging his vision, his hearing and his motor function; he may not be able to continue his lifelong passions teaching and research.We asked if something better is available and we were happy to learn that University of Pennsylvania Hospital also performs proton therapy.  The difference is quite remarkable.  Photon therapy (gamma rays, the most powerful electromagnetic radiation, more energetic than x-rays) goes into the tumor and through the brain, depositing energy along the beam path as photons pass through the target and then through an exit point out of the head through the other hemisphere, causing damage to healthy brain along the way.  In contrast, proton therapy deposits the bulk of the energy at the tumor site without affecting the surrounding normal brain.  Because of this, it allows for delivery of a higher dose of radiation without scatter and damage to the surrounding normal tissues in the brain, and thus causing far fewer side effects.  Doing the proton therapy along with chemotherapy will likely allow Viorel to return to his work to be a productive member of society and maintain a certain quality of life that he would lose otherwise.  Getting the proton therapy for Viorel’s tumor seemed to us like a “no-brainer” and the only appropriate course for him to take, and the doctor recommended it.  He said it would be the best thing for my husband, but it is much more expensive than photon radiation and getting the insurance to pay for it would be difficult.  We thought that we have very good insurance through the University and we decided to go for it.  We felt truly blessed to be close to the University of Pennsylvania and to such a wonderful team of doctors, and we are so grateful to them.  They made a solid treatment plan for Viorel.  The surgery and the recovery went well.  We were eager to start the next phase of his treatment.  We thought that the insurance company would surely support us when we are hit so hard.  Little did we know the harrowing journey one has to go through in the quest of getting appropriate care.  The insurance companies are for-profit institutions and to make those booming profits they do not want to pay for the most expensive treatments if they can get away with it.  So, the doctor requested proton therapy for Viorel’s glioblastoma (to preserve his neurocognitive function and spare him the horrendous side effects) and the request was denied.  The appeals to the insurance, accompanied by a letter of medical necessity from the doctor, were rejected.  Basically, it turned out that the insurance we get from the University is not on our side after all.  They would not pay for the protons when they can pay for a cheaper alternative.  The treatments with radiation and chemotherapy must start as soon as one heals after surgery.  There is no time to waste since the tumor can grow again, very fast.  We put half of the cost of the proton treatment on credit cards and we have 5 months to pay for the other half, and Viorel started the proton therapy on April 3 along with chemotherapy.  Viorel also changed his diet drastically and I am doing it along with him. The treatments are rough on him, but he is doing it and I still managed to catch him smile occasionally.  Viorel loves life and he is fighting for it.  We asked for help from the university and we will continue to do whatever we can to get the insurance to pay for the treatment.  We hope the insurance and the university will come through.  These payments put a huge burden on us and they cause us to fear for our financial future.  When we are so down and face death in the face, we feel the insurance and the university should be there for us.  Instead, they put us through an enormous amount of stress.  We still hope that eventually they will do the right thing.  The new proton guidelines recommend proton therapy for intracranial tumors.  We hope they will update their proton policies and pay for the treatment for Viorel.  But we can’t wait for years, and we can’t count on it.  The financial burden would snowball and overwhelm us.  We found out that so many people care about Viorel and would like to help us.  Viorel is not a person who expresses his feelings and emotions often (even though this changed a bit because of the brain tumor), but he is an amazing human being who loves his family and friends and he contributed so much to mathematics and positively touched the lives of so many students.  In his moment of need, many people who know Viorel expressed the wish to contribute and ease his financial burden on this new journey.  We are so grateful for their generosity and I am setting up this funding campaign to make it possible for people to help.  We need to raise about $150,000 at this time to cover the therapy and other expenses.   Extra money raised, possibly if the insurance reimburses us, will be used to cover related expenses that will show up in the future and Viorel will create a fund at the university to help students and others in their moment of need.  Thank you all for the kindness and support you have shown us and for the help you are willing to give us to help lighten our burden during this extremely difficult time.  Thank you for being here for us.  Thank you for your love and prayers.  Thank you.Ana (Magda)",279,278,10,283,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The results were encouraging, but the road was daunting. Adam spent 3 weeks at Good Samaritan Hospital and another 4 weeks recovering at St. Anthony’s Rehab. It was rough going—painful, frightening and humbling as Adam learned to walk again and gain enough functionality to return home and then endure months of radiation of the brain and spine. #fortitudeThrough 2017 Adam had repeated MRIs showing no new growth and Adam went back to his menschy ways without wasting any time—launching a new joint replacement company, spending time with Robin and helping everyone he could. #everydayisagiftBattle #2: Fast forward to Spring of 2018 when Adam faced an abrupt decline and shockingly learned he needed to endure another surgery to debulk the tumor compressing his spine and go back down the long road of surgery, rehab and recovery. Life got worse for Adam with a few frightening seizure episodes that appear as strokes and additional setbacks, which delayed and depleted his inpatient rehab. #shit As of Aug 12th, Adam has rinsed, washed and repeated this painful, debilitating cycle of surgery –> hospitalization –> rehab. Now, after three months of being under the fluorescent glow of a medical facility Adam is home again. Adam is making slow and steady progress reclaiming his self sufficiency with the support of the amazing team at Craig Hospital where they specialize in recovery from spinal injury. With every PT session, Adam get's a bit stronger. #progress Prognosis: During the most recent surgery the tumor was deeply entangled in the spinal column but the surgeons were able to resect nearly 100%. This very invasive surgery has caused injury to the spine leaving Adam currently unable to walk, and managing significant pain. Adam is doing intensive PT every day and the next 6 to 9 months will reveal how much lower body mobility will be recovered. #toughgoing What now?  For now, Adam is home, enjoying being with Robin and his father Len, considering his professional options, receiving outpatient Physical and Occupational Therapy and doing an excellent job being his guru-ish optimistic self. Adam currently requires a lot of support at home and he and Robin are looking into homecare to make life manageable which unfortunately is not covered by insurance.  Adam is the guy who worked as hard as he could on whatever project he was running, whatever event helped his community.

Immediately after learning about the tumor, Lucio, received 8 cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery in a period of 4 months.In Cyprus, they did not have the technology to continue with his treatment so we went to Berlin, Germany, hospital Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum.

Medical,15,Keep Jack Walking,https://www.gofundme.com/keep-jack-walking,"NEWARK, OH","March 25, 2018","$50,000","$57,525","It has taken Jack 8 years, but he can now walk with canes, even though he cannot feel below the waist. Although he has overcome so much, the tumor in his spine caused scoliosis. Since birth his spine has progressed to a curve of 60 degrees. This is causing health issues and must be corrected. The standard procedure, covered by insurance,  to correct scoliosis in spinal cord injury children is to put ""magic rods"" in them until they are old enough to have their spine fused. The metal rods will restrict movement, making movement and basic life tasks even more difficult for someone with a SCI.  The rods replacement procedure is irreversible and prevents any benefits from future medical advances. It also will only correct his spine by 20 degrees.As a parent, I decided that I couldn't do this to my child. I knew there had to be another way. I researched, traveled to 3 different states/doctors. The first two doctors had the same suggestion, to put magic rods in him. They also told me there is a high probability he won't walk after the surgery because it will restrict his movement, which he needs for the leg weakness. The doctor in NYC also told me that he would prefer I do it closer to home, even though he has done the most of these surgeries (43) because the rods will likely results in complications, including painful brakes of the rods, requiring surgical corrections. So basically put the rods in to stop the spine from curving, but you are now going to deal with lots of complications and he won't be able to walk. The third doctor from the Institute for Spine and Scoliosis in New Jersey agreed that the rods would be terrible for Jackson. Thus, Dr. Betz and his team in New Jersey would do a surgery that uses a cord similar to a bungee cord to correct his spine. It also allows him to move his body, so he can continue to walk, and it is not permanent. The complications are minimal. After hearing about this unprecedented surgery, and talking to other families that have had this done, we were elated and should have known that it was too good to be true. A month ago they called to tell use our portion of the surgery, $50,000.00. We cannot even make an appointment for the surgery until we put $30,000.00 down. They do not participate with any insurance companies, so this amount is set. At this point we feel completely overwhelmed. I cannot put the rods in Jack and tell him that all of his hard work is for nothing, because this surgery isn't covered by our insurance. Asking for help is very difficult for me, and we have always managed to pay for his medical/travel bills to his appointments across the east coast. Everything that has come our way we have managed to figure it out. I have applied for grants, written letters to everyone who is involved with SCI that could possibly help, and I am continually turned down. $50,000.00 is beyond what we are capable of and are hoping that we can get some help to pay for this surgery for Jack. If you are able to donate we truly appreciate it, and if you are unable I understand too.",248,941,6,246,5 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Medical,16,Help Prakash fight Glioblastoma,https://www.gofundme.com/help-prakash-fight-glioblastoma,"LONGMONT, CO","June 30, 2018","$60,000","$56,647","Hi Everyone,I was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme  - the most aggressive form of Brain Tumor there is in November of 2016. I have chronicled in detail the journey since then at  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/02/the-story-so-far.html and subsequent blog posts.Very recently, on June 20th, 2018, we were told from an MRI report that the tumor is back in a different part of the brain:   http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/the-monster-rears-its-ugly-head.htmlThe tumor recurrence needs a brain surgery to be done in the next few weeks as surgery is the first line of defense against the tumor. Consequently, I will be unable to work and earn my living for a few weeks in the next couple of months.Things have become even more difficult for me and my family as I got into an unfortunate accident resulting in a couple of broken leg bones last weekend:  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/a-moments-bad-judgment-leads-to-serious.html

As I have explained in this 5-minute video at Ignite Boulder recently, tumor recurrence is a highly likely possibility for a Glioblastoma patient, and multiple tumor recurrences over a few years - each of which will need a brain surgery to address - is likely to kill the patient in a few years. There is room for hope despite this dire prognosis as innovative and effective treatments are being investigated to cure/handle this terminal brain cancer. Most notably, Duke University announced on Tuesday, June 26, 2018, about the impressive results they have observed from the Poliovirus Therapy Treatment in Phase 1 clinical trial. I am seriously investigating the possibility of me enrolling in this treatment at Duke University in the very near future.   http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/getting-serious-about-moving-to-durham.html Also, hoping for more innovative and effective treatments to come along in the near future to further expected lifespan while dealing with Glioblastoma.I am starting this fund-raiser to help me deal with Glioblastoma as effectively as possible while continuing to live as normal a life as possible.Even while I was in full-health before the brain surgery and terminal cancer diagnosis, I was having difficulty making ends meet as a freelance Ruby on Rails Developer. This problem has been worsened since the surgery in November of 2016, with ongoing treatments, physical and mental limitations from surgery and treatments, lack of a stable income/disability insurance to cover for expenses while I was not able to work/find work, and other factors. The situation has worsened even further since early 2018 because of increased costs of living - increased healthcare premiums, increased rents, increased expenses for support and  unconventional treatments (supplements, diet changes, running marathons, counseling, etc.)Almost every month since the original surgery in November 2016, I have faced a huge gap between my monthly income and the monthly expenses. I have been addressing these gaps with various strategies as follows:* Start a fund-raiser: I had one fund-raiser last year and got a very encouraging response from my friends, family, and well-wishers in the numerous communities I have been fortunate to have been part of.* Avoid/postpone paying bills: A big item in this category is my tax-filing for 2017. I filed for an extension and have not yet paid the taxes due for last financial year. Expecting the bill with penalties to be in the $15,000 range.* Withdraw from my retirement savings account:  Earlier in March of this year,  my bank balance was close to zero and I decided to clean out my retirement savings account instead of making it a habit of starting fundraisers on an annual basis.  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/03/time-for-another-fund-raiser-to-help-me.html* Charge everything to a Credit Card: There have been many big bills coming my way in the recent past from the treatments, as well as my wife's USMLE preparation work. Since all these expenses are unavoidable, I have been charging them to my credit cards. Consequently, I have raised a total of around $30,000 on credit card debts - $16,0000 on personal credit cards and $14,000 on a business credit card.* Reach out to close friends for private donations: In the last couple of months, 7 of my friends have helped me out to a tune of $7,000 through private donations with my financial situation.In addition to outlasting terminal cancer, I want to turn myself into a writer as I have been mulling around three memoir ideas:1. Years 1 & 2 with terminal cancer: A chronicle of my journey with Glioblastoma since the initial diagnosis to surviving the first two years. Hoping to write a short, inspirational and educative tome on this topic.2. How I turned myself from a 5-hour-marathoner to a 2.5-hour-marathoner and qualified for Boston Marathon as a middle-aged-man: Qualifying for Boston Marathon has been an inspirational goal for me for the past decade or so. I hope I will be able to turn myself from my current ability to finish marathons in 5 hours time-range to be able to finish in half that time, and document the process along the way in this memoir.3. Dear Aisiri - A letter to my 4 year-old-daughter: I hope to be around through my daughter's childhood, growing up to be a strong and independent woman, and become a parent herself. If Glioblastoma were to make that impossible and force my daughter to grow up without a father during her important formative years, I hope to leave behind a document that she can fall back on for inspiration and hope in the years to come. Any help you provide through this fund-raiser will go a long way in helping me and my family deal with Glioblastoma with a very positive attitude and increase our chances of outlasting this monster.

He had been living there for only a few weeks as part of his summer internship. The roommates immediately called an ambulance and Ishan was admitted to El Camino Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU).The seizures continued without mercy for the next several days, yet Ishan still showed signs of life. He required intubation for 4 days but miraculously regained consciousness on the 4th day and demonstrated gradual recovery, both in speech and cognition as the days progressed. Unfortunately, an MRI scan discovered a tumor in Ishan’s brain that now requires an immediate surgery, as recommended by his doctors. It is not known yet if the tumor is cancer.Ishan had received the only full-ride scholarship to a Nepali student offered by MIT every year, and had moved to the US in August 2017. A brilliant, kind-hearted, and promising student from Nepal, Ishan now faces financial challenges during and after the surgery-- months, if not years after. His family back in Nepal is already facing financial hardships as Ishan's father-- the family's breadwinner,  just flew over to the US (on August 4th) to provide Ishan additional long-term support, leaving his business on hold. Ishan's health insurance covers his medical expenses. However, living expenses for him and his father,  immigration costs for his father's continued stay until his recovery, and many other expenses during his time of recovery are the areas of financial worry. Upon speaking with people in prior similar situations, we anticipate a significant financial burden on Ishan and his family, in addition to the physical, emotional and psychological challenges. We are friends of Ishan and we are setting up this fundraiser requesting any financial support that you can afford, with the aim to lessen the financial burden from his family. Thank you very much in advance for your generous support!P.s. We plan on being fully transparent about all the incoming funds and incurred medical expenses, as endorsed by Sewa International volunteers.

Y hasta la fecha su cuenta de hospital está en 6,704.07 USD. Estos fondos son necesarios de manera urgente ya que Adrián no puede viajar de vuelta a Ecuador donde los costos medicos son menores.Lo recaudado ayudará a Adrián a pagar su cirugia y a su madre a viajar a Singapur desde Ecuador. El es un artista independiente de mucha promesa y por su trabajo artístico ha ganado premios nacionales e internacionales y ha participado en varias exposiciones y residencias artísticas alrededor del mundo.

They were excited about celebrating their 31st wedding anniversary on May 16th, but unfortunately Johnny suffered a serious stroke the day before, on the 15th. He was airlifted to a hospital in San Jose, Costa Rica.  On Friday, May 18th, Johnny’s condition took a turn for the worse as pressure began developing on his brain, leading to an emergency Craniectomy.  He is currently in the ICU under heavy sedation, but stable.  While we do not yet understand the full recovery process facing Johnny, it is clear that he will be recovering in Costa Rica for at least several more weeks. Hopefully, the various insurance plans the Core's have will cover the majority of direct medical costs.  Yet, it is quite evident that numerous indirect costs are going to quickly accumulate to a significant level.  We are trying to provide the family with the funds to allow Gail and other family members to be at Johnny's bedside during the recovery process.  These initial funds will be used for Airfare, Room & Boarding, taxis etc. for family, and for  medical transport fees back to the US, and to  help prepare for his recovery process once he gets home.This Go Fund Me page is being created by the friends of the Johnny Core Family. Johnny & Gail have showered many of us with their love and support in the past and now we have an opportunity to return some of this love and support to them while they go through a difficult time. Currently many thoughts, prayers and gifts have made their way to Johnny & his family, and we need to build on this momentum.For the past week many of us have been struggling to find a way to support the Core's while they are so far away.  In lieu of flowers or food, we ask that you consider this as an option of showing them support.  As always your continued prayers are most important!Thank you & God bless!",412,1.0k,13,403,3 months,2 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

But our sweet 10 year old will have a journey ahead of him.  He will have to endure chemo for three months which includes 10+ day stays in the hospital for each round. B cell lymphoma can be difficult to diagnose and also likes to spread so although we are grateful that his survival rate is near 100%, Nate has already started the hard work of receiving chemo through a port in his chest and also through his spine with several spinal taps to ensure there is no spread of disease. Not only does he have a long road ahead of him, this will also take him away from his home and his twin brothers Derek and Kyle, incoming 4th graders, for the summer. Nate loves summer and everything that goes along with it, some of his favorites things to do are play golf, fish and swim. However his treatments will take him away from these activities this summer, along with missing the time with his brothers.  Nate is also a boy with special needs which makes his treatment more difficult as it is hard for him to understand the things he's being asked, both physically and emotionally and also hard for him to explain all the feelings he is having.Nate’s FamilyIf you know his parents, Eric and Jenna, you know they don't ask anyone for much help. These past several weeks have been very hard on them trying to manage a household and three boys while one is in the hospital. Eric is self-employed and has put his work load aside to be with Nate.  Jenna works at a preschool and may not be able to go back to work in the fall as Nate cannot get sick because of a compromised immune system. Nate’s amazing parents have not left his side and will continue to be with him on this journey.  As medical bills come in and other things arise (i.e., babysitters, last minute care for the twins, cancelled summer vacations, etc.) this gofundme has been set up for Nate's care and anything that he could potentially need now and in the future as he battles to make cancer a memory! If you can donate, great! If you cannot please #prayforNate!Faith, Family, FriendsWe are so very thankful for the wonderful village of family and friends that Nate has surrounding him to help make this unfortunate time easier to deal with. Receiving care at Maria Fareri Children's Hospital in Valhalla means that the family is close to home and can be surrounded by their tribe at this difficult time. Meals, laundry, carting the twins to camp and offers to hang with us and Nate have been overwhelming. We truly believe in the power of prayer and ask that you continue to #prayforNate as time goes on and his family can adjust to this new normal. We know that God has a plan for us and any funds not needed for Nate will find their way to other kids fighting cancer battles all over.",368,993,26,369,1 month,16 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Their son Winston, 21 months, a rough n’ tumble, joyful toddler with an infectious laugh and a giving nature for a kid so young, was diagnosed with a kidney cancer called Wilms Tumor. A malignant growth the size of a baseball covered his right kidney. Two days later, Winston underwent a nephrectomy (the removal of the kidney) in the hopes that the tumor was encapsulated and that all of the cancer would be eradicated.Heartbreakingly, Winston’s team discovered that Winston’s cancer is Stage 3, having spread to his lymph nodes. He is now undergoing a rigorous six-month course of chemotherapy and radiation. To make matters way worse,  Brian’s employer National Grid locked out all of their workers and stopped paying the company portion of their health insurance even after his union offered to continue working with the old contract until their new contract was negotiated.(You might have seen the interview Brian did about the situation in the video above, which was also covered in a segment by WCVB here in Boston.)There are so many unknowns both emotionally and financially when it comes to cancer treatment and disease management. The Harveys are the kind of couple who’ve both been working hard since they were teenagers. They’re the type of people who go above and beyond when their family and friends are in need.  So I started this GoFundMe to help them in their time of need with Winston’s medical costs during treatment. Winston has been given excellent chances for a full recovery by his oncology team. So, if you’re reading this, please give what you can to reach our goal in helping him return to staging toy dinosaur battles on his daddy’s head and gleefully fist-bumping with everyone in the room.  And if you can’t, positive thoughts or a prayer or two are more than welcome.

Kevin and his young family's lives  have changed drastically. Unfortunately, Kevin will need 24/7 care. Laura, Kevin's wife, will be caring for him and had to leave her job.       Kevin was in the ICU for 3 weeks and was hospitalized for a total of 58 days. Kevin suffered strokes, seizures, brian damage and was in and out of AFIB. Doctors didn't think Kevin would be able to walk, eat, or follow simple commands ever again. Kevin laid lifeless in his hospital bed for several weeks only responding to pain. With help from his loving wife, family, friends, FDNY members/Doctors, Columbia doctors, ORMC Doctors, and the Helen Hayes staff, Kevin is making some progress. Unfortunately Kevin has months, maybe years of rehabilitation ahead of him. Anyone that knows Kevin, knows he won't give up this fight.   Kevin now suffers from Aphasia and Apraxia which effects his motor planning and speech. Kevin struggles with simple tasks we all take for granted.    Kevin has been a dedicated FDNY firefighter for 15 years.

As he had just turned five, his yearly check up was a few days away. Sophy and Michael brought their concerns to the primary care doctor. The doctor wasn't too concerned and sent them on their way to an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist felt it was a virus that may have effected the cranial nerve. To err on the side of caution the ophthalmologist sent Ori for an MRI to rule out anything else. Ori's MRI was on Monday July 24th and on Tuesday the 25th the Singer's lives took a turn that is a families worst nightmare. As Sophy and Michael sat down with the neuro-oncologyst and various other doctors they learned that Ori has a tumor in his brain stem. The doctors refer to this as pediatric glioma in the brain stem. If you don't already know, the brain stem controls almost everything: swallowing, seeing, breathing, and beyond. Ori's tumor is in his brain stem and is inoperable. Immediately Sophy and Michael were on the phone with multiple doctors, friends and family members to determine next steps. They were able to schedule a biopsy for one week later and an additional MRI. On Tuesday July 31st Ori was put under general anesthesia and underwent a biopsy where a robot went through his nose and into his brain-stem. The surgeon was able to get what he needed. With the biopsy has come many set backs for Ori and the Singer family. Due to edema from the procedure and the sensitivity of the brain stem Ori has since been unable to swallow, is slurring his speech, and is having a hard time smiling and using the muscles in his mouth. In addition he is having some respiratory set backs with his oxygen levels and coughing throughout his day. As of last night, Wednesday, Ori was moved from the ICU to another room. The neuro-oncologist shared that Ori would need time and rehab to strengthen the muscles that support his speech and swallowing. Lastly he received an NG tube which goes through his nose and delivers food into his stomach. The goal is to fill Ori with nutrients as he is re-learning to swallow. Within the next 2 weeks the Singer family will learn the results of the biopsy and a treatment plan will be determined. There has been such beautiful outpouring of love and support from friends, family and the community and the Singer family is very grateful. The purpose of this Gofundme page is to raise enough money so that Sophy can take 1-2 months off from work to focus on Ori's next steps while also caring for Sasha, Ori's twin sister.  Sasha has visited Ori in the hospital. At this time she knows that Ori has a boo boo on his brain and he has a special tube in his nose to help him eat while he is learning to swallow again. Its hard to believe how quickly one's life can change. Please consider contributing to the Singer family.With so much love, gratitude and sincere appreciation.Kim, Carlsbad CA",470,1.3k,7,472,1 month,21 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

For the last eight years, the Gooleys have spent much of their time in emergency rooms and doctor’s offices, searching for answers and praying for healing. As doctors began to manage the initial diagnosis, another came: Vasculitis in the form Bechet's Syndrome . On top of his diagnoses, he’s battled recurring pneumonia, sepsis and had two heart attacks. And the last nine months have been the hardest of all. Tim missed his brother’s funeral, his eldest son’s wedding, a son’s law school graduation and a family trip to California. He received a third diagnosis, mycobacterium (MAC), broke his right hip and was left bedridden after an emergency knee replacement four weeks ago.On April 15, 2018 after a severe vasculitis flare left him hospitalized and delirious from the pain, Tim was airlifted to the Cleveland Clinic to give specialists another shot at treating him.Throughout this journey, family members, the community and their church stepped up, offering prayers and everyday support, as Joni split her time between caring for Tim, raising the three youngest children and working full time as the guidance counselor at Lake Park Elementary.

A little bit about Ezana: Ezana Goitom is 45-years old, the son of Neguest Menguesha and Goitom Gide, youngest brother of Ephrem, Issayas, Zebad, Aster and Azeb Goitom.  Like all his siblings, Ezana went to Lycée Gebremariam French School in Addis Ababa, before emigrating to the US in early 90's.His medical condition:Our brother Ezana Goitom Gide sustained a spinal cord injury and has been diagnosed with Central Cord Syndrome.  He is now quadriplegic, bed bound, unable to move his extremities.  Ezana is oxygen dependent with a tracheostomy to breath.  He has a speaking valve that allows him to speak.For the past seven  months, he has been to different hospitals due to many health complications and problems.   After many ups and downs, two steps forward one step back, he is currently preparing for an acute rehabilitation.Based on the overall assessment of the Doctors, we are realistic in recognizing that he will not regain his motor skills and now, we are gearing towards planning his future accordingly.This is where we are making this humble appeal to our family and friends for help.  The road is long and we are turning for your help to alleviate some of the financial burden we are facing. This experience has made us all reflect in the preciousness of life.   We are constantly reminded to do our due diligence by Ezana’slove, smile, sense of humor, his courage in his acceptance of his condition and yet with optimism in a future where he sees himself being productive and independent.  Ezana says the outpouring of love and support received during these past seven months from family and friends inspires him to endure with hope and sanity, as we, in turn, are inspired by his attitude to do all we can to help him.   His medical condition should not be an impediment to living life to its fullest and to being productive – the mind is too precious not to fight for.We would like to thank all our friends and family members who have been with us during this difficult time and words fail us to express how grateful we are for the love and support you’ve shown us.  May God reward you a thousand fold! Zebad, Ephrem, Ezana , Azeb and Aster in Neuro-ICUWhere your money goes: Ezana needs  an acute rehabilitation.  In order to be admitted to a rehabilitation center, he will need a discharge plan to a safe living space for his condition.  This means that he has to have a place in Washington, D.C., which is approved by the American Disability Act.  We are currently looking for suitable apartments close to the rehabilitation center until we find one through government help in the long term.Although he may be eligible to receive 12 to 18 hours of home aide per day, his current medical status requires 24 hours skilled nursing care per day for which he will need to pay out of pocket.In addition, the equipment needed to alleviate his situation is costly.   Since he is unable to use his limbs, he will need a computer to be operated with his eyes/voice and a motorized wheelchair to be monitored with his head. Also, in order for us, the family, to move him around from home to an out patient acute rehabilitation, we will need a handicapped friendly van. It is a humbling experience to ask for funds, however life is too sacred not to fight for it.Please stand with us and help us know we’re not alone. Again, thank you so much for all that you’ve done for us.   It is in the support that we’ve received thus far that we found the courage to make this appeal.Ezana with his mother",399,3.0k,3,397,3 months,1 day ago,-1,2018-09-03

A small mole on his shoulder began to change. It was removed and showed to be cancer. It grew back very aggressively and had already spread to his liver and spleen.He flew to Canada to begin treatment but his body kept rejecting the medicine and he became sicker and sicker.The cancer then spread to his lungs. He came back to Los Angeles in December to begin a cutting-edge cancer treatment trial at the Beverly Hills Cancer Clinic.It was then discovered that the cancer had spread to his brain. He immediately began 2 weeks of brain radiation. The results of the radiation are being monitored now to see how successful it has been.He is receiving long-term treatment to try to arrest the growth of the cancer and stop it from spreading further.The treatment is immunotherapy, radiation and T-Vec. Now his insurance company in the US has stopped approving his T-Vec injections. They’re also taking weeks/months to approve immunotherapy treatment, scans and basic care that is imperative to Mark’s recovery. It’s dangerous because Mark has Stage 4 Melanoma and it is a highly aggressive form which has shown to spread and metastasize very rapidly. He has flown back to Canada to try to get the medication and treatment that he needs with cancer specialist, Marcus Butler at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, who is one of the leading Melanoma specialists in North America. He needs to be in a little apartment in Toronto where he can be close to his doctors and the cancer clinic. We need to raise enough money to pay his rent, bills and living expenses for a year or two. This will give him the time to finish treatment and regain his health and beat this.He has been unable to work since he was diagnosed and has no form of income. We need Mark Howard in the world, not only because he is an amazing father and friend but for the music he is yet to give us… Put on “Time Out Of Mind,” “World Without Tears,” “Wrecking Ball” and think of Mark and then donate.

As my treatment has continued forth, it has reached a point where my treatment team is recommending the need for additional treatment. After undergoing the 5th regimen of chemo, I have begun seeking out consults from multiple major universities and hospitals throughout the state.  After no additional clinical trials or treatment options have been found here in Florida, the search has begun to be explored outside the state. The Lord has opened a door in Houston, Texas at MD Anderson. I was contacted last week and was told I was a candidate for a study that would be held during the summer and am also eligible for additional treatment options that Florida does not currently have. This of course is an answer to my prayer and a move that is highly recommended from my treatment team. However, with this comes much expense due to the need to having to stay in Houston for the duration of my treatment. Unfortunately this decision has placed me in a very big hardship and in need of additional funding so I can heal. Please pass this on to anyone who knows me or is sympathetic to my cause. Prayers are additionally recommended.",137,319,0,135,5 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Oncologists at Sloan Kettering are aiming to shrink the tumor enough to operate, since it currently touches one artery and is wrapping around another artery. They may also administer another round of chemo and/or radiation following the surgery. As anyone who knows Margo would expect, she is facing this diagnosis with her characteristic tenacity, pragmatism and bravery.  In late June, she said goodbye to her coworkers at Caliper Studios in Bushwick, a job she loves, in order to focus on treatment and healing. John, her husband, and their two kids, Declan (14) and Severine (11) and their dog Lucy, will be by her side in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The coming months are not going to be easy, but the support of friends and family will make all the difference. We are asking you to be as generous as you can in Margo’s time of need.All money will go directly to Margo and her family. Funds will help offset her loss of income, medical expenses not covered by insurance, and the many other outlays of money necessary to provide comfort to her as she fights cancer and recovers from this overwhelming ordeal.No donation is too small, and anything you can contribute will make a difference. She and her family are already very grateful for the support they’ve received in the wake of this diagnosis. Margo has started a blog on CaringBridge.com. You can read it here:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/margogibsonWe will also have a fundraising event for Margo after her surgery in the fall, where some of her favorite local bands and DJs will perform.

We are unsure if a portion of his paralysis is temporary, or if this will be a permanent reality for him, but for now, Jeff will live life as a paraplegic.We’ve had so many people reach out to us, so we’ve created this GoFundMe for those who want to help.One of the biggest hurdles Jeff and his family will face moving forward is the struggle of regaining the quality of life they once had. We would be incredibly grateful for any financial support you can offer to make this happen. The expenses are sure to stack up quickly; current and future medical bills, wheelchairs, wheelchair ramps, widening doors, modifying bathrooms/kitchens, wheelchair lifts for stairs, a new car that can accommodate a disabled driver are all priorities, but they only represent a portion of the financial burden his family will be bearing during his recovery.Please, be generous. Help Jeff and his family maintain the quality of life they’ve worked so hard to build. Your support is appreciated more than you can know. We love you and thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We will leave off with a message that Jeff wants you to hear:“Every single one of you reading this needs to go hug and kiss your family, right now, at least electronically if physically isn’t an option.  Because you never know when your life will change so suddenly and so violently and so permanently...”“Stop fighting over nonsense that doesn’t matter.

Allen is facing a very uncertain future.  Christy has many tests scheduled and is unable to care for herself.  Allen has medical insurance, but every home visit his insurance will allow comes with a co-pay.  That could be $75/per day alone.  Additionally, if he has to take leave without pay, he will have to pay part, and very soon all, all of his medical premiums at almost $1,000/month.  Allen did not want to ask for help, but his brother-in-law who is also a deputy reached out to us at their Association and asked for help.  We are trying to coordinate a donation of hours, but our county requires employees to jump through almost insurmountable hoops to get there.  Therefore, we need to reach out and ask for any assistance you can give.  The family is under a tremendous amount of stress coupled with the unknown as Christy continues to rapidly deteriorate with no diagnosis.    Every penny donated will go directly to Allen to help defray any costs and pay the bills.  He is tremendously worried about feeding his children over the coming months and we ask you to help relieve some of that stress so that he can focus on taking care of his wife and children.  Thank you very much!Below is what I asked Allen to write up for this campaign.  I am so touched by their love story and hope that you are also.  From Allen:  Christy and I met when she moved in across the street from me.  I was 17 and she was 16 at the time in 1988.  We started dating and dated for six years before deciding to marry in 1994.  We had our first child Bradley in 2003, Second child Tyler 2006, and third child Ian 2010.  We purchased our first house in 1998 and are still there to this date.  Our son Bradley started having medical issues around 2014 which created numerous trips to several different doctors, time off work, and extra medical expenses.  Bradley was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus almost a year later.  In July 2017, we started to notice Christy having difficulty performing routine daily tasks.  Christy started seeing doctors about her condition in July 2017 and was then sent to the specialists at USC for further evaluation.  It has been determined Christy has a brain disorder that has yet to be diagnosed.  At this point in time Christy cannot walk without assistance, care for our three boys, and cannot be left alone due to her high fall risk.  I have depleted my vacation / comp banks to tend to the needs of my wife and son and expect there to be large medical bills soon.  Any money donated will be used only for medical and household necessities.",414,1.2k,3,416,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

As many of you know Ann Marie has received quite a tough diagnosis and needs our help. On June 18, on her birthday no less, she was given a diagnosis of a rare aggressive throat cancer.Because of the severity and aggressiveness of the cancer, laryngectomy surgery is scheduled next week (July 3, 2018) at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. In order to get all of the cancer, they will completely remove her larynx (voice box), and lymphnodes; she will loose her ability to speak. She will need to learn how to breathe, talk and eat in a new way. Post surgery she will be in the ICU for 48 hours and then will remain in the hospital for 7 - 10 days. She won’t be able to eat through her mouth and will use a feeding tube until while her throat heals. She will learn to use a temporary device to communicate (Electrolarynx) in a new way and begin the long process of recovery. Once discharged from the hospital she will require homecare support and nursing to help with the healing process. She will be home 4-6 weeks attending to the care of her stoma, other medical issues and medical appointments. Once the site has healed a Voice Prosthesis (TE- Tracheoesophageal) will be placed at that time which is the gold standard in voice restoration. At that time she will learn esophageal speech. When recommended by her Dr’s, she will receive 35 days of Radiation along with a combination of Chemotherapy.  She needs our help with funding: ·       Purchasing and maintenance of laryngectomy equipment which is not covered by insurance -remember this is for the rest of her life. ·       Purchasing ongoing Voice Assistive technology speaking equipment so she can communicate with health care workers, family, friends, colleagues, clients and patients. Her goal is to return to her private practice when she is strong enough. ·        She will need extensive speech rehabilitation, medication and additional therapies to help her stay strong. All of these services will be capped by insurance and will require out of pocket monies to cover. Again, this is for the rest of her life. ·       Home services not covered by insurance for ongoing care (Private Nursing, Speech, etc.)·       Deductibles from insurance·       Loss of income – which covers her health insurance, medical expenses, and ongoing home expenses, and private practice expenses.  Any monies not used in this process will be donated to Dana Faber Cancer Institute for helping larynjectomy patients.  It breaks my heart that Ann Marie will have to go through this.  For those of us who have had the pleasure to work with her, we know what a caring and talented woman she is. Her generosity of spirit, combined with her expertise and wisdom are a rare gift - she is a rare find! As a colleague, she has a wealth of experience to draw upon that has enhanced my knowledge.

It was a Monday and like most Monday’s Brianna didn’t want to get up and go to school. Even 8-year-olds can have a case of the Monday’s now and then, or so my sister had hoped. This Monday turned out to be very different. It was life-altering, heart-stopping, and heartbreaking.My sister is a critical care RN and has had a gut-wrenching feeling for years (6 to be exact) that something was medically going on with Brianna. She, like any good parent, took her daughter Brianna to doctor after doctor looking for answers. She went to a total of 27 specialists over 6 years, each one explaining away Brianna’s weird symptoms and unexplained weight gain. My sister kept thinking all along that Brianna may have a tumor in her pituitary gland and asked for CT scans and MRI's from many physicians over the years. All of the doctors just said the same thing, ""she is just overweight"" blaming her symptoms on her weight. Refusing to do CT scan because “we don’t like to expose children to that much radiation” or ""the insurance is never going to approve an MRI"". All of the doctors were telling her that her daughter's raspy voice, paralysis of the vocal cord, swelling of her head, dizzy spells with nausea were just symptoms of weight gain. Finally, on April 9, 2018, Brianna had another rough morning of dizzy spells and couldn’t get up. My sister took her back to the ER who again, blamed her weight. They told my sister that her dizzy spells were because she is an anxious child, she needs to lose weight and to see a psychologist. My sister refused to leave the ER without a CT scan. Our worst possible nightmare was now a reality. Brianna, in fact, does have a brain tumor.... and because so many years had passed and so many health care providers let my family down, the tumor has had years to grow and spread into her spinal cord. These same doctors, including the ER doctor that day, are calling my family almost daily to tell them how sorry they are and to check on Brianna. We are not trying to put down the health care system, Brianna’s mom is an RN. We want all parents out there to know that frequent hiccups, hoarse voice, body odor at a young age, and dizzy spells are some of her symptoms that are definitely directly related to her tumor. Please do not simply pass them off as no big deal. Brianna is in for the fight of her life and needs her parents and brother to be with her as much as possible. Her mother and father both had to stop working in order to take her to Memphis, TN to Bonheur Children’s Hospital for tumor resection. Here was her best chance to get as much of the tumor out based on size/location and the fact that it spread. Her first 15-hour surgery on April 16, 2018, had complications of blood clots throughout her brain. Then on April 27, 2018, she had to go back to surgery because of fever, leaking of Cerebral Spinal Fluid and intense pain. She now has a brain drain (EVD) and may need a ventricular shunt in the coming weeks. Both her parents were everyday hardworking people, an RN and Journeymen Linemen, just getting by day to day and trying to do the best for their family. Now they both need to be with Brianna as she is extremely ill and as any 8-year-old would need, she needs her parents by her side. So, if you are able to help them in a monetary way in their desperate and darkest time of need, then Thank You from the bottom of our hearts. If you are unable to help monetarily, then please lift up our family in prayer because we need all the thoughts, prayers and love we can get for our family at this time. We pray that you will never have to hear the words the ER doctor told my sister, “I’m sorry, you were right... She has a brain tumor and we have failed her all these years”",888,556,11,923,4 months,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

On May 31st, 2018, they removed a plum sized tumor from his brain. The doctors have given him less than a year to live.  The best estimate is 3-8 months. He's maxed out on radiation and chemo is not promising - it might extend his life a bit but does not appear to be a viable solution. He's working hard at a holistic approach, but the situation is dire. I'm a friend of the family and I'm raising money for him: both for the future of his family and to help them pack some joyful living into the time he has left. He has a short window of health left. This money will help defray hidden medical expenses not covered by insurance AND help Josh and his family to do some things together as a family before the cancer takes it toll. Josh's employer, The South Bend Fire Department, has been exceptionally good to him. We need to rally once again for this beautiful family. The names of their kids: Ellie - age 12JJ - age 10Mia - age 8Annabell - age 7Grace - age 5Ezekiel - age 1.5This situation is urgent. Anything you can give today, tomorrow, next week and next month will have an IMMEDIATE impact. Please consider a generous gift to this family!

After meeting with the oncologists at both Dana and Dartmouth his first form of defense is going to be chemo therapy.  He needs to attack the whole body, not just one concentrated area.  What kind of chemo treatment he will receive is still being determined. Seth is currently working with oncologists at both at Dana Farber and Dartmouth Hitchcock.  With as many experts' minds pooled together, they are going to coordinate and hopefully develop the best treatment plan possible for him.  Chemo will just be the first of many to come!Due to the extreme amount of pain he has been in he has not been able to work.  Once he started receiving medications (which he is still finding the right combination to work for him) he could not return to his place of employment while taking these medications.  He is considered not ""fit for duty"" as they call it in the Nuclear Power Plant world.  So he's had to step down or resign at this point from his job.  With no steady income at the moment and a number of expenses coming in, we are asking for the help of our family and friends.  We can't ease his physical or emotional pains,  but our hope is to relieve some of the financial burdens of this illness.  His focus needs to be on getting himself better and taking care of his adorable three year old son Carter.

We are in such a state of shock. We don’t even know how to fully process this. While on his way home early in the morning, Nate’s car skidded on ice, crashed, and ejected him head first through the windshield.Nate was in the snow for five hours, and his body temperature dropped to 81 degrees before the emergency workers were able to find him. He was life-flighted almost immediately to a hospital in Sioux Falls, where our family rushed to be with him. He has swelling in the brain, but no bleeding as of now. He has broken bones in the lower region of his back, and severely bad road rash across his back. The doctors decided to put Nate in a medically induced coma and hook him up to a ventilator in order to reduce the brain’s swelling and body’s trauma. He is still unable to gain full consciousness as of now, and hasn’t opened his eyes yet, but we are patient for his recovery. Thanks be to God there is hope. Nate’s hands, feet, eyes, and brain are all responsive and moving. His doctors are stunned that he is even alive, but we know how big our God is and what great miracles He gives to us. Now though, we are forced to play an excruciating waiting game while Nate’s body works to heal. We are plagued by doubts and fears, and almost consumed with an anxiousness that ranges from a numbing worry to all-out panic.  We say almost because, although this event is one of the worst kinds of pain for a family, while there is life there is hope. We are surrounded by an unbelievable support system that is praying for us minute by minute. We are so incredibly blessed by all of you, and will be thankful for everyone’s thoughts, prayers, and love forever.Our next step is to make a plan to get Nate home when he wakes up. This means flying him from South Dakota to California while trying to keep him with all the necessary medical care. Our family needs $30,000 to do this. If anyone feels like they are able to donate, even just $5, we would be forever grateful. And if not, we ask from the deepest part of our hearts to please send up a few prayers for Nate, that he would be able to wake up soon. Again, We are so thankful for every one of you, for even taking the time out of your day to read this post. Believe me, your prayers and love are felt every second of the day. We wish all the happiness to you and yours, and hopefully will be able to send a miracle update any hour now.

He has flown with jetBlue for over 14 years. He had opportunities to advance to captain, but he decided to wait for our daughter to finish high school before we relocated.  Craig was instrumental in being a role model to our daughter Rylee, who is currently a student in the Aviation program at Utah Valley University following in his footsteps.   Hurricane Irma welcomed us to Fort Lauderdale when we relocated in September 2017. We took an emergency flight out to Puerto Rico between the two storms. We are so grateful for jetBlue’s compassion and generosity of capping all flights at $99 during that desperate time. Every work flight, I look forward to my love Craig returning home safely. On his last return flight home, the day before father’s day, Craig told me that he had pains in his stomach. When he arrived home, his eyes looked a little yellow.  In the morning, they were bright yellow and his skin was orangish yellow.  On our way to the beach, we made a quick stop at instacare, and surprisingly we were rerouted to the ER.  He was there for 6 days and they found a cancerous tumor in his upper GI tract.  Whipple surgery was scheduled for July 16 to remove the tumor. The surgeons felt this intense surgery would be effective and that his cancer was curable because it was so small. During the three week wait for the surgery, Craig had the most positive, strongest attitude that he would beat this. We enjoyed being together each day, working out, walking on the beach, snorkeling and kayaking to keep his mind off the upcoming surgery.    July 16, 2018 had dual meaning for our family. Our daughter, Rylee, was getting her multi-engine certification and Craig was having major whipple surgery.  At the same time, Rylee was in the air, successfully taking her skills test, and Craig was in a long 8 hour intense surgery. In Craig’s critical surgery parts  of his intestinal tract, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, and the gallbladder were removed.  After surgery, he was not sent to the ICU to be carefully monitored. After 4 short days and still spitting up black bile the hospital still released him to go home. Less than 24 hours later, he became violently ill. I called 911 because he was non responsive and his skin was gray. They rushed him to ER where he aspirated feces bile into his lungs. His heartbeat flatlined. They revived him and put him on  a ventilator - oxygen life support. He has been in critical care ICU for 5 weeks. His perfectly healthy lungs were destroyed, before his body even had time to heal from the surgery. Several chest tubes are in his lungs to drain the excessive fluid. The doctors informed me he needs a lung transplant. The hospital has been contacting hospitals all over the country.  Craig is not qualified as a recipient because his cancer needs to be in remission for 5 years before they would accept him as a transplant recipient. We are searching for other options.  After several brain and body scans, all other organs are fully functioning.  He is fully conscious and aware. He has a strong heart, mind, and soul.  He is loving, kind, young, physically fit and positive.  He is a true friend to everyone!   Currently, I, along with family and friends, are praying for his every breath, literally.  Everyday my time is spent with him. I am reaching out to others, who want to show their love and support for Craig Hellmers needs.   Much Love Tricia  Craig Hellmers, I love you more, we are going to grow old together.",431,589,4,440,12 days,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Eric has been struggling with chronic Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections for the past ten years.Lyme disease is no joke. Symptoms include severe fatigue, brain fog, neurological and arthritic pain, insomnia, and depression.

If you know him even a little bit, you know how much he likes to work! Treatment for advanced Lyme is quite expensive and the majority is not covered by his health insurance. Sadly, the Office of Workers Compensation Program (OWCP) is a cumbersome, contentious, and unresolving system that leaves many wildland firefighters with overwhelming medical bills to cover.Erics wife Celine has been elected as the sole beneficiary for funds gathered during the campaign.

There is currently no cure for this dreadful disease, and the standard treatment is radiotherapy simply to extend the child's life. You can read more about DIPG here Over the last 8 weeks, Georgia has undergone 4 MRI's, a brain biopsy and 6 weeks of radiotherapy. At this time, this is all that conventional medicine can do for us. However, there ARE therapies out there. They're experimental in nature, but we've researched them endlessly and identified the ones that show promise. We feel very strongly that we owe it to our little girl to try them. Her quality of life is forefront of our mind, so we won't put her through endless treatments if she is clearly deteriorating. But right now, she's improving, and has such a will to live and a love of life, that we are determined to try and save her. Without trying these treatments, she has just months to live. The first, and perhaps most costly procedure, is she is being fitted with a Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) system. This is a relatively new technique which allows cancer fighting drugs to pass across the 'Blood Brain Barrier', the impenetrable wall that makes treating brain stem cancer so difficult. You can read more about CED here  This procedure is estimated to cost around £60,000.Once fitted, Georgia can receive transfusions of the chemotherapy drugs that show some promise, as well as using immunotherapy treatments to fight the cancer. These infusions will involve travelling every few weeks to Europe, and are estimated to cost between £6,000 and £20,000 per infusion. Our total estimated costs are in the region of £200,000 to £300,000 and are all Out of Pocket. We are draining our savings to fund as much as we can, but still have a shortfall. People have been so kind and generous already but if you can spare anything at all to help Georgia, we would be so incredibly grateful.

Medical,20,Help Katie Fight MS,https://www.gofundme.com/help-katie-fight-ms,"BOSTON, MA","May 6, 2018","$60,000","$57,300","This is a long story and I hope you don’t mind, because my family needs your help!      My daughter, Katie Kelly O’Donnell was diagnosed with MS in February of 2016. At the time of this diagnosis, Katie was a mom, a wife, a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a niece, a cousin, a friend, a teacher, an active runner and a traveler.  Katie’s daughter, Áine, was 15 months old.  Shortly after Áine’s birth, Katie started to notice some difficulty with her balance, her memory and word retrieval.  She thought these symptoms were postpartum related or stress after going back to work with a baby.     Fortunately, her primary care doctor listened to her concerns and ordered blood tests and an MRI.  Two days later Katie was told she had pernicious anemia, which is serious low vitamin B levels and often has similar symptoms to MS. This was a big relief for someone who thought she might have brain cancer! Her primary doctor encouraged her to go ahead with the MRI scheduled for 2 days later.  As soon as the radiologist read the report, Katie was sent to the emergency room and was admitted to the MGH neurology floor.       After several more tests, including a lumbar puncture and consultation with many doctors Katie was told the MRI results showed 70 – 90 active liaisons on her brain and her spine.  She had Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS).  RRMS is consider the best form of MS (if there is such a thing) and many people who have RRMS live full and happy lives.  RRMS is a chronic, disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and the body.       That weekend Katie started to imagine her brain full of crawling snakes like Medusa!     After 4 days of treatment with steroids, Katie went home believing that she would be back to her students the next week.  Her family and doctors kept suggesting she needed more time to allow her brain to recover.     Six weeks later I was with Katie when I noticed her acting strangely and she admitted that she was seeing double.  The ride from Weymouth to MGH was stressful as Katie saw 2 cars instead of 1 and 2 people when I only saw 1!   At the hospital Katie saw disjointed body parts of people walking the hallways.  How do you explain this without sounding crazy?  She was admitted for observation and the new MRI showed more MS activity.  We were in a nice room with a great view of the moon on the Charles River. Katie asked us why the moon was moving, kind of dancing around. We looked at each other with concern and explained that the moon was not moving, it was just hanging in the sky.     Katie is a fighter, she did not give up and she ran a 5K road race the next week with a friend.     At this point, she realized she was not going back to work for a long time.  This was a tough realization.  With this relapse we all realized that this disease was much worse than we originally thought and her doctors told her she had a much more aggressive form of RRMS than they originally thought. This relapse meant Katie was not able to work, take care of her daughter, run by herself, sing the alphabet song, read a book, drive or get out of bed on some days.  She had severe headaches from her forehead to her tailbone.     The doctors started Katie on a new drug, Tysabri.  Tysabri is administered intravenously every 4 weeks at the hospital. This drug seemed to prevent flare ups for a time being, however, the fatigue and pain has never gone away.     In October of 2016, about 7 months after her diagnosis, in pouring rain, Katie and her friend, Kara, ran the BAA ½ marathon and finished without stopping. They promised each other they would not cry along the way.  I was on the side lines with my sister and we cried! When they finished, Katie and Kara allowed themselves to cry.     Katie stayed hopeful and with the help of family and friends who drove her to and from work, prepared meals and looked after Áine, she was able to return to work full time in February of 2017, 1 year after her diagnosis.  She was happy to be working again, but it was exhausting.  Every day when she went home from work, she gave Áine as much attention as she could and went to bed crying, before sun had set. She finished the school year and with the help of her principal, she was able to secure a 3 day a week position for the fall of 2017.      Last month Katie was excited to spend a rare Saturday evening out with friends, playing bingo at the church all.  She sat down and even before taking a sip of a drink, she knew that something was happening in her brain. Two friends helped her out to the car and they drove her to my house because it was closest. One look at her and I knew we had to go the MGH immediately! This was another scary ride to through Boston because Katie could not hold a bottle of water in her hands, she was shaking all over and her jaw started to droop. At the hospital, they originally thought she was having a stroke or a brain aneurysm and she got plenty of attention.  These were quickly ruled out we breathed a sigh of relief, but it was MS. She was admitted again, was given high doses of steroids, was released the next day and missed 1 week of work.  Since this relapse, the fatigue is worse, her memory is worse, her word retrieval is worse and her debilitating headaches are worse.       We decided to look for other treatments. The only treatment shown in clinical trials to be effective at halting the progression of RRMS is hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In addition to halting MS progression, some patients experience reversal of symptoms. This treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy to wipe out the immune system, and then the patient’s own bone marrow stem cells are transplanted back in the body to help rebuild an immune system with no memory of MS. Without HSCT, there is a 100% probability that Katie’s RRMS will continue to progress. At this point, this is the best option to halt the progression of this disease and maybe erase some of the systems. This is not a cure, but it is hope.        Since HSCT is very limited in the States, Katie and I will travel to Mexico so that she can receive HSCT.  Insurance will not cover the cost of the procedure. We are seeking donations to offset the cost of HSCT and follow-up care, which is approximately $60,000.      Katie wants to have this procedure because she is tried of living a half a live.  She beats herself up because she worries that she is not a good enough mother.  In her words, “Áine deserves better.”  Doctors consider Katie “stable” but she goes to work every day with debilitating headaches and exhaustion.        We are grateful for the wonderful care Katie has received at MGH, for our large, loving family and a great community of friends.  We will be holding a fundraiser sometime early this summer.  We hope you will join us or consider donating thru this site.       Fear has two meanings: Forget Everything and Run or Face Everything and Rise!  Katie has chosen to Rise!",226,373,4,256,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

He is the best father I could dream of having - and has touched many lives with his kindness and generosity.Doug has been in a hospital in Mexico with an acute brain infection for three days.  The medical care here is slow and the physicians have been unable to diagnose his condition.  It is vital that we get him back to the US to a hospital where they have adequate expertise and resources to get him appropriate treatment immediately.The insurance company has denied our requests to airlift him to the United States so, in a desperate last resort, we are chartering a private airlift to get him home. The medical evacuation will cost $70,000 which is absolutely necessary but is way out of our family's means. We need the money as soon as possible to pay off the costs of the flight. If we exceed the goal, any extra money will go to his direct medical costs. Michelle, Doug's wife, will be the beneficiary of this campaign, as she will be the one handling all of Doug's medical costs.Please donate what you can and share this message to aid our family in getting my dad home.  Thank you for loving my dad and helping us get him home.",537,1.1k,0,549,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,20,The Hubrich Critical Need,https://www.gofundme.com/the-hubrich-critical-need,"MONTEREY, CA","March 7, 2018","$75,000","$51,861","Laura and Markus Hubrich Need Your HelpAfter a battle with breast cancer three years ago at the age of 50, Laura fought hard and came out on top. Her beautiful look on life, in light of her challenges, is an inspiration. In February 2018, Laura thought she had caught this season’s cold and had laryngitis, walking pneumonia, and Valley Fever - turns out her cancer was back; in her lungs, her brain, and a tumor had grown large enough on her vocal chords that it destroyed nerves and caused permanent damage to her voice. She is now undergoing chemo and radiation therapies to manage the multiple brain tumors and we are praying for a positive outcome. Laura has been the family’s source of income for the last two years, since Markus has been diagnosed with Neuropathy, which is preventing him from being able to work.  Struggling with these life challenges has been hard enough, and now the cancer is back! With two kids at home, 12-year-old Nina and 17-year-old Stefan, we are concerned about their day-to-day family needs, let alone the new (and recurring) medical bills, home and transportation costs, and other basic needs.  Markus, Laura, Nina and Stefan are such an amazing family who are generous at giving back to the community through their church, friends, and neighborhood and are always the first family in line to offer support for others in need. This is our time to give back. Laura’s positive attitude never ceases to amaze, even in her darkest hours. Please make a donation today to help this family survive through this difficult and challenging time and we ask that you pass on this link to others who would be able to give. If you cannot donate monetarily, maybe you have another resource that could help the family in another capacity, that would be just as valuable. Thank you for joining hands and hearts for Laura and Markus - our prayers are with the Hubrich Family in their desperate time of need.",274,548,6,298,5 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,20,Henry Miller,https://www.gofundme.com/henry-miller,"SANTA BARBARA, CA","May 17, 2018","$100,000","$51,839","This week our family received the terrible news that Andrew and Giana's 3-year-old son Henry has been diagnosed with leukemia. While Andrew and Giana are devastated at the news, they are steadfast in their resolve to fight this battle lockstep with and for their eldest son. This is not the first battle that Henry has had to wage. Born 10 weeks premature, Henry spent the first 5 weeks of his life in the NICU at Cottage Hospital weighing just 3 pounds. Andrew and Giana hardly ever left his side and brought him home a healthy, albeit small, baby boy. Since then, Henry has grown to be a big boy, full of life and always ready to play and have fun. Even now, admitted into the ICU at Cottage Hospital, Henry is continuing to find joy in his surroundings and looking for the next opportunity to get up and play. At this point, we don't yet know the severity of the cancer. Tomorrow Henry will undergo surgery where a port will be inserted in order to push chemotherapy and other drugs. He'll have bone marrow pulled to determine the type of Cancer. He'll also have a spinal tap to determine if the Cancer has spread to his spinal cord. His stay in the Hospital could be limited to 10 days, or as long as 4 months. We just don't know yet. He's facing at least a three year battle of serious steroid and chemotherapy treatments at this point.Our family is rallying behind Andrew, Giana, Henry and Hudson. We will fight this fight together utilizing every resource available to us. Andrew and Giana will be focusing 100% of their time to healing Henry and making his physical and mental state as comfortable as possible. During this time, neither will be able to work. Yet, as you know, bills don't stop, and healthcare isn't free. Andrew, Giana, Henry, and Hudson need your support and help to finance this battle. For those of you who know Andrew and Giana, you are very much aware of how much they deserve your support.",329,950,54,333,3 months,3 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,20,LANDON JOHNSON'S CANCER TREATMENT,https://www.gofundme.com/LandonCancerTreatment,"WAILUKU, HI","March 10, 2018","$100,000","$51,726","Our dear friend and brother, Landon (Doug) Johnson, and his beautiful family (wife, Cassie, and 8-month-old son, Bodhi) have just received unthinkable news. Landon has been diagnosed with Stage IV Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer there is, in his frontal lobe. Landon is only 39 years old. After experiencing severe headaches and slight personality changes, Landon received a brain scan on February 28, 2018. The MRI revealed a massive tumor in the 7 cm range (the size of an orange). With no time to waste, he and his family packed their bags and immediately flew to the island of O'ahu to undergo surgery to remove the brain tumor.Surgery went well, with 98-100% of the tumor successfully removed! Landon did experience several strokes during surgery, resulting in some of the deeper parts of his brain dying. However, their beloved surgeon, Dr. Kumar, believes that other parts of his brain can compensate for that and expects Landon to be able to make a full recovery (in terms of brain damage).  Now, Landon requires extensive treatment. Dr. Kumar recommends the ""gold standard"" of treatment, which includes both chemotherapy and radiation. Another treatment option would be Optune; a wearable device and fairly new & successful method. After the ""gold standard"" treatment, it is suggested to pursue a clinical trial for immunotherapy at one of the nations leading cancer facilities.  In conjunction with the conventional treatments, the Johnson family will be attacking the cancer from many other angles, including; nutrition (keto diet- to starve any remaining cells from their glucose food source), exercise, stress reduction, supplements, medical marijuana, infrared sauna, and so much more. The average survival time with Glioblastoma (grade 4) with regular treatment is 12-18 months - only 20% of glioblastoma patients survive more than one year, and only 3% of patients survive more than three years. With the radical treatments, clinical trials, and age on our side, his chances can be greatly increased- with a 20% chance of surviving 5+ years. In some cases, patients can live up to 20+ years!! With that said- the Johnson famliy NEEDS funds to be able to pursue radical treatments and give Landon his best chance at living a long, fulfilling life.Landon has touched and continues to impact the lives of countless people: as a social worker, small business owner, son, husband, and now father. He lives on the island of Maui and loves to surf, travel, be in the ocean, and of course, spend time with his new son & beautiful wife. We humbly request assistance in restoring hope for the Johnson family. Your contribution will help cover the astronomical costs of treatment, travel costs, loss of income, rehabilitation, and quality of life for the Johnson famliy during this unimaginably difficult time.",344,1.1k,18,342,5 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

On Sunday our sweet wild boy suffered a near drowning, he was medi-vaced to Phoenix Childrens Hospital where he remains in critical condition. No part of his brain survived the accident so we ask at this time that we continue to pray forour sweet boy and his strength and serenity but that we also extend those prayers to our family and friends and anyone that had the privilege of knowing this perfect angel. We pray that everyone can hold strong to his memory and help him to live on forever in the good deeds we do for one another.**If you have any questions about how to help or what we can do for the family right now, please send them to christin@mail.harvard.edu. Let's give Travis, Ashley, Dylan, Atticus, and their family all the time and privacy they need.

---------------------------------------------------------------If you are from Yuma, you have likely been touched by the kindness, friendship, and generosity of Travis Krizay and Ashley Simms. Growing up in Yuma, these two were both so well-known for being remarkably loyal friends, devoted family members, and people you could always turn to if you were in need of help, a shoulder to cry on, or simply someone to be there for you when you needed them.


Now it is our turn to be there for them.Recently, Travis and Ashley's family had to undergo a medical emergency. With the family likely having to take off of work, the cost of medical care (even with insurance), and unplanned expenses that come with these types of emergencies, we all have an opportunity to help repay the kindness these two have shown to so many of us. By helping offset some of these costs, we are giving the family time to focus on what's really important and not let finances be the source of any more unneeded stress. Please help in any way you can. With their incredibly family and friends so eager to help this family in their time of need, this small gesture has the potential to support them in a useful, effective way. They mean the world to us, so let's give a little back to them. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. *I will update the page with some minor updates regarding the fundraiser or any potential messages the family wants to share, but let's give them all the privacy and time they need right now to focus on their family in peace. <3",595,3.1k,35,574,2 months,2 months ago,2 months,2018-09-03
