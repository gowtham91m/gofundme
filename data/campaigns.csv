Medical,1,Olivia Stoy:Transplant & Liv it up!,https://www.gofundme.com/olivia-stoy-bone-marrow-transplant,"ASHLEY, IN","May 18, 2018",$1.0M,"$316,651","Update: Many fundraisers have been put into place to raise funds for the Stoy Family to cover the cost of the transplant. Nearly a month into fundraising, Olivia's story had reached so many people that the initial goal was met! $350,000 was the cost of the initial procedure and does not include additional treatment: hospital stays longer than the allotted 50 days, medications, time off of work, and travel expenses. Depending on how fast Olivia's health progresses after the transplant, additional bills could add up fast. Now, Olivia wants to use this experience to bring light to childhood cancer and raise additional money for other children in medical battles of their own. As a result, she created Liv It Up , a campaign designed to shed light on the struggles of childhood cancer through her own personal experiences and those of families she has met along the way. In an effort to help her through the recovery process, Olivia wants to raise $1 million for Liv It Up, to help give young cancer patients a chance at being a kid and their parents the peace of mind that they will have help paying for life-saving medical treatments like Olivia's.Olivia Stoy was an active 12 year old girl, finishing her first year at Angola Middle School. What was thought to be a lingering cold turned out to be something much more serious. Olivia was sent from a local hospital to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and was eventually diagnosed with T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.  Right away, her team of doctors worked on her treatment plan.  Of course, there were a few bumps in the road: a chemo medication that at normal strength caused Olivia to have seizures; an infection which meant an automatic 2 week stay in the hospital; not to mention all of the trips to and from Riley in between those events.  But after all the ups and downs on February 14, 2017 Olivia was declared cancer free but would need to continue treatments through September 2018 to increase the chances of her cancer not returning.During this time, many people asked how they could help, how could they donate. The Stoy family was not in need of funds at the time and Olivia wanted to make sure other kids could benefit from the work of the Child Life Specialists at Riley and Cancer Research. All money was directed to the Riley Foundation where Olivia chose it’s route. To date, over $50,000 has been donated to Riley in Olivia’s name. In March 2018, just one year after celebrating Olivia being cancer free, Olivia’s cancer returned. It was devastating for all who followed her story. Right away the doctors at Riley worked on a plan for Olivia’s relapse. The plan consisted of several rounds of chemotherapy and once the cancer is gone a bone marrow transplant will be needed. After testing members of Olivia’s immediate family, her brother was found to be a 100% match! The Stoy family is part of a faith sharing insurance plan that does not cover organ transplants, including bone marrow transplants. While the family has appealed to the insurance board, on May 14, 2018 the sharing/insurance plan declined coverage of the bone marrow transplant which is the recommended treatment option by doctors at Riley Hospital for Olivia’s survival.We are fundraising for the Stoy Family to help cover the cost of the bone marrow transplant. The original estimate is $900,000. The family has negotiated a price with the hospital and needs to raise $350,000 before for the bone marrow transplant can take place which is estimated to begin July 2018. Should any complication arise during Olivia’s treatment additional funds will be needed. If funds are raised that exceed the amount needed for the bone marrow transplant, the hope is that this fund can provide to other childhood cancer patients and their families for years to come in honor of Olivia Stoy, a true fighter and inspiration to so many!Tax deductible checks can be made out to “Liv it Up” and mailed to Pleasant Lake Mennonite Church | c/o Liv It Up | 5142 S.

Medical,1,Claire Wineland Needs Our Help,https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire,"GARDEN GROVE, CA","June 12, 2018","$225,000","$264,710","First of all, WOW!! We have been blown away by the amazing outpouring of love and support you have shown to Claire..deeply humbled in fact.  Friends have encouraged us to raise the goal to meet the demand but I want everyone to know that our transplant finances have been covered in full.  Anything additional you choose to donate will be to show Claire your love and to help her do something amazing post transplant.  She is full of wonderful ideas but first new lungs, then look out world! :) <3 ""Death is inevitable, but living a life we are proud of is something we can control"". ~ Claire Wineland Some of you may have heard one of Claire Wineland's  many inspirational speeches at events such as PTTOW, THRIVE: Make Money Matter, WORLDZ, Zappos, Klick Health, TEDx, OMED and AARC or possibly you follow her on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram   or YouTube  but one thing about her is she never asks for help for herself, she is a stubborn little force of nature and determined to  live her life to the fullest despite her failing health and is always, always of service to others and shares her message far and wide. This last year, her decline due to having Cystic Fibrosis  (CF) has been drastic.  She is unable to do the work that she loves, which is traveling the world to share her message with thousands of people, she is using a wheelchair due to shortness of breath to walk more than 100ft and her quality of life has become just about staying alive. ￼ This is not the Claire we all know and love. ￼  She has recently been placed on the UCSD Lung Transplant list and is anxiously awaiting the call for new lungs.  A new start, a new chapter #metamorphosis.  Again, we want to make sure that everyone knows this money will not be used for the transplant itself, we do have medical insurance. But the ancillary costs  and medication co pays before, during and after can be considerable, and as you know, she is already struggling to make ends meet and is unable to work. Full recovery can take approximately 6 months post transplant, barring any complications or rejection.We will keep you posted as to her progress! Right now, the doctors say she needs to gain some weight in order to bring down additional risk factors. Did you know that CFers need 5,000 calories a day just to maintain their weight? This is why we started this Go Fund Me page ~ to give her the support she needs up to and beyond transplant for at least 6  months.   Since the transplant will take place in San Diego and she currently lives in Los Angeles, she needs to rent an apartment for 3 to 6 months post transplant as well as pay her rent and living expenses until the big day comes since she is no longer able to work to support herself.  We are thrilled that lungs are on the way but she needs a community to help cover all of the endless expenses involved.  The back and forth to San Diego appointments, the hotels, her current living expenses etc.. We hope that she has inspired you with her endless positivity, sense of humor and charitable work through a non profit she founded at 13 years old, Claire's Place Foundation which ironically helps other CF children and families in the way that she herself needs now.  If you don't know Claire, please take a minute to Google  her name and see some of her videos on line and on social media as well as a beautiful episode on The CWs ""My Last Days, Season 1 "" Directed by Justin Baldoni  and Wayfarer Entertainment. ￼ CNN  has done 2 stories covering her journey for 2 years now and will continue to cover her experience pre and post lung transplant to spread awareness about the process and what people with Cystic Fibrosis go through. Even as her lungs fail, she is still willing to share her experience in the hope of helping another young adult with CF who may be considering a lung transplant. Claire was recently named Glamour Magazine's College Woman of the Year Grand Prize Winner 2018   for her work in advocacy and charity.  Behind the scenes, she struggles for breath and is currently in end stage lung disease, but that is not the face she shows the world. ￼ Please, consider making a donation today so that we can relieve the stress she is feeling about not being well enough to continue working until transplant and possibly up to a year post transplant. What would be most helpful is if  you could make a 10 - 30 second video about how you have been inspired by Claire and then share that video along with this link to your community and social media following.  I am sure with your help, we can reach and maybe even beat this goal.   https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire with hashtag #TeamClaire Thank you so much for your support!  Please do share with followers, friends and family that you feel might be inspired to support as well. Your donations will be deposited in to a private account for Claire and used to pay her rent and expenses over the next 6 to 18 months so she can simply focus on this next huge step while she is so ill.  Specifically travel money, hotels, medications, apartment rental pre transplant here in Los Angeles and post transplant in San Diego, food and other necessities for Claire.Warmly, #TeamClaire ""Truly honored to have lived, failed and accomplished in the ways I have"" ~ Claire WIneland ￼

She is a self less soul who always places the happiness of others above hers.When she got pregnant the 2nd time, we were excited as friends to see the baby boy. She got herself checked in for delivery at Stanford medical facility - Dublin the night of 16th May 2018. Its been 65 days but Ganga hasn’t returned home. Ganga went through 2 cardiac arrests, brain damage and has been in coma and a partial vegetative state past 65 days. Ganga was diagnosed with AFE (amniotic fluid embolism). A rare childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid, enters the blood stream of the mother to trigger a serious reaction. When she was awaiting delivery the night of, the amniotic fluid percolated into her system putting her heart through 2 cardiac arrests. The CPR brought her back temporarily but the fluid mixed blood had affected the brain pushing her into coma.Her husband Sriram, our dear friend has not left her side since that day. It kills him to watch the enigma of his life, lying unresponsive to the very voices that filled her life. Her little child still thinks her mom is just unwell and will come back and hug her soon, the baby boy Rithvin has not felt the touch of his dear mother till this day.At this heart wrenching moment, we would like your help to keep Ganga in the facility, so she receives the much needed treatment to recover. The family has undergone unimaginable trauma in a matter of hours and its been 65 days of suffering.Our hopes are high, she is taking baby steps of progress now, she opens her eyes, but can’t process her surrounding yet. She can hear you speak but cannot respond yet. But we are happy she has progressed thus far. We seek your help to continue the treatment and hospital care such that our Ganga returns back to us the way she was in fullness and health. Her little children have suffered enough and should be able to re-unite with their mother soon.

She had lower abdominal pain all summer long, and just before going back to finish her final year at Covenant College in Georgia, she went for a check up at her gynocologist to check for orvarian cysts. During a laproscopic procedure the cancer was discovered. After meeting several oncologists, Hanna felt strongly that she needed to pursue a natural approach to dealing with the disease. She was able to enter into the care of some of the best alternative doctors available who felt confident they could help her. And so, over the past 6 months Hanna has pursued every avenue of homeopathic treatments, traveling to doctors around the tri-state area every day of the week, sometimes two in one day. We found out two weeks ago that the the tumors in Hanna's abdomen have grown from 3 CM to 17.5 CM - and have englufed her bladder, uterus, ovaries and affected part of her liver. It was made clear to her and my family that surgery is required immediately.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:Hanna met with THE top surgeon for this type of cancer in Washington D.C. and he has an opening available to perform surgery this Thursday, March 8, 2018, before he takes a leave of absence. But, our insurance will only cover procedures within the state of New Jersey. We need to raise the funds to get this procedure done this week. We have no time to waste chasing down the insurance company. All donations will be put into the bank account of Hanna's mom - Hope, as she is sparing Hanna the financial burden as Hanna fights for her life. Throughout this entire experience, Hanna has remained steadfast and hopeful, which we credit to God and the immensely supportive community of friends and family who have come alongside her, prayed for her and sent notes of encouragement to Hanna. We recognize this is an incredible amount of money to try and raise in such a short amount of time, but her life depends on it. We believe that God is bigger than cancer, and that everything is possible through Him. So, we are hoping and believing for the impossible - and would be so grateful for anything you can do to help financially and by sharing this page.",2.7k,3.7k,14,"2,705",6 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATES|| 8/06/2018 - 1930 MST|| Jake is enjoying his recovery in Dhahran and slowly getting back to normal: spending time at the student center and getting back into a daily routine. Last weekend was a weekend of firsts. First time driving, first time in the water, and first time throwing a frisbee! || 7/17/2018 - 0149 GMT+2 || Jake had a great time watching the World Cup Final with his students at the Student Center yesterday evening. Jake continues to be active in working towards his recovery. He has been doing PT at home with his Mom and brother Caleb coaching him everyday. There have been ongoing medical appointments and things are moving in a good direction. Again, thanks for everything, ALL of the support has been nothing short of amazing!|| 7/12/2018 - 1638 MDT || Jake is continuing his recovery back in Dhahran. The main goal currently is to reduce the swelling in the residual limb and he has already seen some progress. He has been awarded a new and more suitable house form Aramco, which he appreciates very much! The move is still in progress, but a big shout out to all the people who have already lended a hand! 


The food train has been an absolute blessing and he is eating quite well! The best news of all is that his Mom (Robbin) and Caleb (his brother) have arrived to Saudi!|| 7/7/2018 - 2200 MDT || Jake is starting to feel more at home again in his community. He's very happy to be back and has enjoyed catching up with a few people and slowly getting back into a more normal routine. Aramco is in the process of finding him a more suitable living arrangement as well, something that is a single-floor. Yes, he also went back today to teach his first fitness class! Here are a few pics from him driving with a colleague to look for a new place as well as him with his fitness class. || 7/4/2018 - 1800 MDT || Jake is SUPER happy to be back in Dhahran in his community! However, the heat is NO JOKE over there and forgetting your sunglasses doesn't make it any easier on a 110+ degree day! (Pic below) He's very happy to be back in an environment where he is familiar with the medical staff that is treating him. He is also very thankful for the meal train that has been initiated for him (link:  https://www.mealtrain.com/trains/zv21gd ). More to come later and he's still not quite ready for visitors, but thinks that next week may be the week.|| 7/3/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jake has safely made it back to his community in Dhahran! It's amazing that he was able to move himself so early. He told me that it was pretty wild to think that he was undergoing surgery for the amputation of his leg less than 5 days ago, and he was now using crutches to move across the tarmac and board a plane! It took a tremendous amount of energy for him, so he is still resting quite a bit, but Jake is excited to start seeing everyone soon! Now that he is back in his home community, they have organized meals for him which he is beyond excited about! Pics to come later! || 7/2/2018 - 1400 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake earlier today and he is ON THE MOVE! He departed the hospital in Jeddah earlier today and is on the plane on the way back to Dhahran! He is SUPER excited to be back in the community and to continue this road to recovery. He asked me to share a few pictures of him on the move today. More to come soon with his updates, and I don't know when he'll be ready to start seeing visitors, but I know everyone is anxious to see him. I'll be sure to let everyone know as soon as he feels up to it. BTW - can you believe how good he already is on crutches?!?!BTW - Yes, I realize that some of the photos are sideways :) I'll eventually figure out how to get them straightened out without cropping out half of the photo! || 7/1/2018 - 1600 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake a few times today and he has a lot of positive news he would like to share! He has a few pictures to share as well. The first picture is of Jake cleaning himself up a bit, getting his hair washed and just sitting up for a while! The second is of him learning to balance himself on crutches and moving around, a LOT! The third is of him receiving his latest blood transfusion. Which, we have also received the results from, and his levels are stable enough now for a short term air travel back to the hospital in Dhahran (where he lives and his community is). He is hoping to get fly there tomorrow pending any other complications! As always, he is in great spirits despite the circumstances, and is SUPER thankful for the support. Again, huge shout out to Sarah who has not left his side and has been a tremendous advocate for Jake the last few days. Not to mention all the of support that Aramco and all of his friends/family are helping with behind the scenes .|| 7/1/2018 - 0400 MDT || ""You got to Move it Move it"" is the theme of Jake's day today! He called me (Caleb) this morning to inform me that he was moving under his own power with crutches. He was able to get out of the bed and do a little bathing (which we know both Jake and Sarah were grateful for). His energy levels are much higher today than yesterday. His body has accepted both blood transfusions that they gave him over the last 30 hours, which takes a lot of time and requires very frequent monitoring making it tough for Jake to rest. He is moving more towards stability Pics to come soon! || 6/30/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jeremy (Jakes brother) spoke with Jake this morning. We are all really impressed that he is up and moving! He was able to get out of his bed yesterday and got to start working on his balance. Jake said, ""It's a little weird, my body has a new center of gravity now"". It was a LOT of effort for him to be up and moving yesterday. Today, he has been taking a little rest from all that work, and has his focus set clearly on catching up on all the World Cup games that he's been missing! Here's a photo of Jake's current status. || 6/29/2018 - 1100 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake this morning and he is up and moving! He has been making great progress, which none of use every doubted that he would for a second. They were able to take the catheter out this morning (which Jake is thankful for) and he is starting to move around. His spirit is unbreakable and unbelievably positive. Also, he wanted to share a few photos for everyone. He also wanted to let people know he stood up under his OWN POWER using the bars that they installed. Sarah has been a rockstar as well and there with Jake supporting him and pushing him right along into the recovery! He's super thankful for everything and is doing his best to respond to messages as he has the time and energy.

|| 6/28/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake today and he is in great spirits! He managed to get some good laughs in with Jake and talked about how he is doing. Jake said that the highlight of his day was a giant bag of cherries which he devoured! He is getting his appetite back and is becoming more stable every day. He is still not in a good position to accept visitors, but we all know that with his big personality, it won't be long! All of your support is appreciated and I'm certain that all of us together are making a big difference.|| 6/28/2018 - 0800 MDT || The family spoke with Jake this morning. He is overwhelmed by all of the support and expressed his thanks for all of it. He know's its tough, but he asked for NO VISITORS at the current time. He is still very focused on the recovery and will advise the family when he is able to accept visitors. Thank you again for all of your support and understanding. || 6/27/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb (Jake's brother) spoke with Jake tonight. He's in great spirits and appreciates the overwhelming love and support from everyone. He is stable at the hospital in East Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He's been getting good rest and has someone with him 24/7. Please try not to overwhelm him as he's resting. The family will be providing accurate updates on this page.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The family is managing the online side of this GoFundMe page.

The current prognosis is that she will never walk again.Victoria retains complete mental capacity as well as the use of her head, neck and arms.

Her rare form of cancer puts her in a situation where conventional medicine cannot help her any further.She is pursuing alternate treatment at the Immunity Therapy Center near San Diego where she will start receiving the intensive, targeted treatments her body is needing now more than ever. These treatments will strengthen her immune system as well as help it to recognize the cancerous cells in order to overcome them. She is scheduled to begin on Monday, May 7th, and will be needing the funds by May 27th at the latest.  Her father, Rick Ridings, is overseeing this account, withdrawals, and payments.  On May 8th, we increased the goal to $50,000 as they have now recommended extra treatments and continuing care. This is an urgent need and any amount you are able to contribute to her life is deeply appreciated! Please share this page and spread the word for this. Thank you! For more details, see below.Read more of Esther's story on her blog: https://findingperspective.net/The BackstoryHi, I’m Esther Moore. I’m a mother, musician, a writer and blogger. I’m married to William Moore and we have a gorgeous little four year old boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. ￼￼￼￼About a year and a half after finding out Levy’s surprise diagnosis at birth, I was told at the age of 26 that my body was fighting a very aggressive, fast growing type of cancer  - triple negative breast cancer, one of the hardest to treat conventionally. I had two surgeries, an extensive one where they took out all my lymph nodes in my left arm and another when I found a second lump under my arm a few months later. ￼￼￼￼Then, I found a third lump - the third time the cancer had recurred within 9 months. At this point the doctors told me that they wouldn’t recommend surgery, because it would just keep coming back. They said that unfortunately, since it had shown to be so aggressive and recurring, any treatment they could give me like chemo and radiation would most likely only be palliative (just have a small chance of even extending my life), not curative. It was devastating to hear. After the surgeon told me it was now inoperable and that there was nothing else they could offer me that would be curative, we prayed about it and decided to move back from the UK to the place I had grown up to be near family - Jerusalem, Israel. I’ve been following an intensive natural/alternative treatment plan since the beginning that has helped a huge amount. We also have been blown away by how many people around the world have been praying for us and believing with us for total healing, that we believe has made a huge difference. Thankfully, this seemed to help delay the cancer spreading since the oncologist told me back in October 2016 that it would have spread to all my major organs within the next three months. Up until recently, it miraculously hadn’t spread at all and was still contained to the area under my arm. Where I am nowRecently, I’ve been in a lot more intense constant pain. My left arm has also become swollen, painful and unusable with symptoms of lymphedema (common after the surgery I had). We decided to go to the hospital here to see if anything could be done. After what felt like a million tests, scans and long days at the hospital, we found out the results...and they were not what we were hoping for. It showed that the cancer now had started to spread throughout my lymphatic system, and that they had also found a small mass on one of my vertebrae bones. It was so hard to hear, but we’re thankful that it hasn’t spread further and has not spread to any organs. Still, we knew something had to be done. Although this would now class it as stage four cancer, the doctors at the hospital said there was still hope. They told us there is a new cancer treatment called immunotherapy, a treatment that supercharges the immune system to fight against the cancer itself that has had incredible results - even for people with stage 4 cancer. Our next stepsAfter a lot of prayer and research and talking things through, we decided to look at clinics that specialise in this treatment. We found one near San Diego called the Immunity Therapy Center  that offers immunotherapy along with all of the intensive, non toxic treatments that I have researched and been wanting to do.  There are case studies of people who did these treatments at this Center who had stage 4, triple negative breast cancer  and had incredible results - even going home cancer free. The center combines the latest cutting edge medical treatments with holistic, natural non-toxic therapies to get the best results. From independent reviews  it looks like they have helped thousands of people, many with stage 4 cancer, to massively improve and often become cancer free. Within a couple days of finding the clinic and it being confirmed to us that this seemed to be the next step, everything miraculously fell into place faster than we could have imagined. I’ll be flying out today (!!) to start treatment this Monday, the 7th of May.  We strongly feel that this is my best chance at getting my life back and being here for our son and future children. But, we need your help. All together the costs come to 30,000 US dollars for a three week treatment. Many people in my situation have had incredible results even in these three weeks, but included in this cost is a detailed intensive home treatment plan provided by the clinic for at least three months afterwards as well. We’re so thankful for the incredible support network we’ve had around us from the beginning from all over the world, and appreciate anything you can do to help us meet our goal by donating and/or sharing this page.

With dedication and hard work, while training in Antigua, Greg landed a full-time, professional crew position on a sailing yacht. Greg’s dream became a reality and he was excited to begin his worldwide adventure traveling and working on the vessel.While anchored off the island of Grenada, Greg was enjoying a relaxing day with his crew at the waterfalls when the accident happened. Severe damage was done to his spine along with fractures of his right foot and ankle. Thanks to a very gifted Cuban trained Neuro surgeon, (Dr. Nillo Alveraz, age 28), Greg's fractured back was fortunately stabilized enough to be quickly airlifted back to the United States. Upon arrival in Florida, Greg's back was permanently repaired and stabilized. Then, efforts turned to multiple surgical attempts to repair the compound fractures and soft tissue damage to his right foot and ankle. However, to give Greg the best hope to ultimately enjoy a pain free and active life, it was necessary to amputate Greg’s right foot below the knee. Greg’s dream came to a halt and his future life became altered. But, with Greg’s character there is absolutely no doubt hope and courage will prevail. He has always stepped up to any challenge placed in his path.Greg is now on his new road to recovery assisted with the loving support of his doctors, family and friends.  Insurance will cover many of his medical costs but not all. Most importantly, he will require access to the best available services and prostheses for him to live his life to its full potential.  I'm certain all those who have known, loved and admire Greg will want this for him too. The cost of prosthetics will be significant and an ongoing financial burden. So please, let us all consider “stepping up” for Greg. Please do donate to Greg's recovery as he deserves the best doctors, therapy services, and most importantly, prostheses out there to achieve a full recovery and regain his healthy, active lifestyle once again.No donation is too small. Let’s work together to make sure Greg is given the means to ensure full recovery.  Our contributions are perhaps “one small step” for us and “one giant leap” forward for Greg. We love you Greg-you got this!*For those wondering, Greg's father, Ed Strauss is listed as the main beneficiary of this campaign. This means all your donations will go directly to Greg through his parents. We thank you all for your love, support, and donations!",1.1k,2.4k,12,"1,157",4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We felt we needed to start something to help alleviate any financial stress so the Duncan family and James’s partner, Colleen Maxwell can focus on treatment and healing. Colleen has been part of James's life since high school, and will continue to be by his side and care for James and his children. The money donated will be used to pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance and to help with daily living expenses. James has a long road ahead of him, but we know James has the strength, determination, and faith to recover to his fullest extent. Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers and thank you for your support. Your thoughts, prayers, generous donations and resources to help him heal are sincerely appreciated. ￼",785,1.6k,3,767,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

When they discovered that wasn’t possible, both were undeterred. The Rogers felt there was room in their home and hearts for adopted children. Their first, a newborn daughter, was adopted from a broken home in 1989. The second, a 12 year-old Russian boy adopted in2005.The Rogers entered Jaiden’s life not a moment too soon. After his birth mom signed over guardianship, Tim and Natalie were finally directed to remote residence in Georgia. When they walked in ‘the smell was overwhelming.’ They found a little boy with fetal alcohol syndrome, neglected and malnourished, huddled next to his filthy car seat. He was even once observed eating dog food out of a dog dish because he hadn’t been fed.For the first year they had Jaiden, he used to sneak into the Roger’s bedroom in the middle of the night and feel their faces to make sure they were still there, then go back to bed. What neither Jaiden nor his new family could have known then was the only thing more horrifying than the first chapter of Jaiden’s life would be the second chapter.The trouble began innocently enough 6 years ago when Tim noticed a small lump on Jaiden’s right thigh just underneath his skin. He took Jaiden to a dermatologist who told them to keep an eye on it. The lump started getting bigger. Even more startling, the lump had started to spread…. fast.“It was as if the skin on his right leg was an 1/8 of an inch thick with something very hard underneath, like stone. It felt like tapping on a countertop.”In a matter of weeks, the growth had wrapped around Jaiden’s right thigh and behind his knee. Once the hard calcifications invaded the joint, Jaiden began to lose mobility. The family rushed to Texas Tech Medical Center for a biopsy.When the results came back, even the doctors couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Jaiden was diagnosed with something called Stiff Skin Syndrome. Jaiden is the 41st documented case ever in the world, and the only one in the world righ now, as far as we know.Stiff Skin Syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by hard, thick skin, which can spread over the entire body, causing immobility. Muscles become weak, and the pain is unbearable!Jaiden’s doctors acknowledged that, they’d never seen such aggressive spread of the syndrome. In a month, it spread to Jaiden’s left leg, both hips, buttocks, and his arms. Spots have recently appeared near his spine. The once-hyperactive Jaiden is often confined to a wheelchair and no longer able to attend school with his friends.  Every day the pain from the disorder grows worse. Jaiden is the first to point out new, hard spots of skin. Jaiden understands that he is sick as much as a 12 year old boy can, although he cannot fully grasp the intent of the sinister syndrome branching out just beneath his skin.JAIDEN IS SLOWLY TURNING TO STONE!Over the last few years, the fight back has begun. Jaiden’s treatment started with rounds of chemotherapy to try to halt the spread of the calcifications. The chemo destroys both good and bad cells, leaving Jaiden weak and open to infection. He wears a medical mask to prevent infections or viruses he would not be able to fend off due to his weakened immune system.Jaiden has also started physical therapy. This is the most crucial component of his treatment. His muscles must be stretched to keep his joints limber. The stretching is immensely painful. Still, Jaiden smiles and jokes with his doctors. Jaiden submits to therapy 3 times/week. Ideally, he should be in therapy 6 times per week but the co-pays are too costly for the Rogers family.Because there are so few recorded cases, nobody knows what the worst case scenario is here. As aggressive as Jaiden’s calcifications are spreading it’s likely the disorder will spread until Jaiden experiences total paralysis. Jaiden will become entombed inside himself.  Jaiden takes 10 medications a day including a chemo medication and 4 different heavy duty pain medications.WE CAN NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!Jaiden’s stiff skin has now started to restrict his lungs and he now requires oxygen and a resperator to help him breathe .  As his chemo continues to help slow the progression of his stiff skin, it is starting to spread at a faster rate.  We have exhausted all help in the United States, costing  the Rogers over $500,000 of there own retirement money and they have also mortgaged their house. We are now left with one last hope for Jaiden , AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. We absolutely need to get him to Europe to try a special stem cell treatment specifically for rare skin diseases.  Without this treatment Jaiden’s Skin will continue to harden and and he will start to deteriorate.  We are unsure about what will start happening to his other organs.  THE COST OF THIS TREATMENT AND THE COST TO STAY INEUROPE FOR A YEAR WILL COST ROUGHLY $1.5 million.  The Rogers are asking people to donate what they can.  WE CAN NOT DO THIS WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR HELP!!  IIF WE CANT RAISE THE MONEY TO SAVE JAIDEN , WE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING TO DO FOR HIM..  We are also asking if you have hotel points or flyer points that you are willing to donate, please let them know.Jaiden is a survivor. The first two years of his life he endured hardships no child should suffer. The lasting effects of which are imprinted so deeply he would sneak into his new family’s bedroom just to make sure somebody was there. Today, we’re all there for Jaiden.Jaiden has been seen on the daytime tv The Doctors, Goog morning America, channel 5 news out of Colorado Springs, channels 4,9 and Fox News out of Denver and also newspapers all over the world trying to find a cure.The Rogers are currently working with Dr. Elizabeth Swanson with Childrens Hospital and Dr. Hal Dietz at John Hopkins University, Baltimore. https://people.com/human-interest/12-year-old-boy-disease-stone-entombed-within-himself/",2.4k,2.6k,17,"2,435",4 months,1 month ago,4 months,2018-09-03
Medical,3,Save Kenneth Young,https://www.gofundme.com/savekennethyoung,"HILLSDALE, NY","March 10, 2018","$95,000","$134,775","Nightmare in PanamaMy Father, Kenneth Young, is fighting for his life in Panama. Dad has bacterial meningitis and a collapsed lung, and is under intensive care at Clínica Hospital San Fernando, Panama City.Although Dad has medical insurance back home, it doesn’t cover out of country treatment and we have been relying on his travelers insurance, which just ran out. The hospital is demanding payment up-front before further treatment.We desperately need your help to keep him alive long enough to recover to the point where he can be transported back home.Keep Kenneth AliveBecause he is a foreigner, the hospital requires money up front, and they require a large amount. Initially they required a $20,000 deposit and we were able to scramble for the cash as well as raise our credit limit an additional $15,000. However, intensive care is incredibly expensive. Some examples: to remain in intensive care costs $800 a day. To “adjust the respirator” costs $50 each time which is done many times a day. The doctors charge thousands every day and procedures such as X-rays and CT scans are also expensive. We are tapped out financially and need your help. Please give whatever you can so that my sister Esther can have her father at her graduation this spring. So that my little brother Evan, who has down syndrome and only knows that his dad is sick, and all his friends and family can see him again.My Dad's StoryMy dad Kenneth and mom Irene had been planning this trip for years. My mom has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we thought that the combination of warm weather, affordable living and family friends would make Panama an ideal place to retire to. One of my dad’s best friends is originally from Panama, and my parents have been planning a scouting vacation to see if Panama would work. For as long as I remember, my dad has worked incredibly hard for my family, when my mother developed her condition my father somehow managed to balance between working even harder and being the best husband and father my entire family could ever have hoped for. The hideous irony here, is that what was supposed to have been a well deserved trip to prepare for a sustainable retirement has turned into a nightmare for our whole family that is devouring the very retirement funds that my parents were trying to save.Shortly before the trip, both my parents came down with the flu, despite making sure they got vaccinated. They were both feeling better in time for the flight but (according to the doctors) my father likely developed a secondary ear infection he was not aware of. As the plane descended for the landing Kenneth’s eardrum burst. Shortly after, Dad began complaining of pain, developed a fever and became disoriented. He was brought to a local clinic where they administered antibiotics, but this was not enough. He was brought to a hospital where they informed my mother that the infection had moved from his ear to inside his skull and that he had meningitis. Since then it has been a constant battle. Doctors put him in an induced coma and performed surgery to physically remove as much of the infection as possible. Although the antibiotics seemed to be mostly working, the seriousness of his infection meant it would not be an easy recovery under the best of circumstances. Unfortunately, there have been additional complications as one of his lungs has partially collapsed. This all means that, although his travel insurance will pay for emergency medical air transport, he is in too serious a condition to transport at this time. I have dropped everything to fly down to Panama with my sister Esther so I can help my mother and be with my father. My mother and I are currently staying in a cheap airbnb near the hospital. The cost of living in Panama City is surprisingly, not that much cheaper than back home, but we doing everything we can to be as extremely economical as possible. 
A message from my mom, Irene.""We are so fortunate to have close family and friends who are helping out with our son, Evan, at home. Evan has Down Syndrome and requires help with day-to-day living. Our daughter, Esther, graduates college on May 7th. It would be a wonderful miracle if she could have her father there with her. It would be the best graduation present ever. Out eldest son, Luke, will stay down here for a couple of weeks to help support me. Esther returns home to finish out her semester. I am so grateful for all the loving support we have received so far. The emotions on that end are overwhelming and fill my heart with love. Please consider donating whatever you can to help keep Kenneth alive and for me to stay here with him. I want Kenneth to come home also for Evan, who only knows that his father is sick. Evan is desperate to see Kenneth again. Please share our story with your Facebook friends, too. Thank you for taking the time to read about what has happened to Kenneth. Obviously this turn of events will have a profound effect on Kenneth’s future, the future of our family, and the greater community as well. We wish you well, and are grateful beyond words for the outpouring of sympathy and concern we have already received.""",612,1.6k,75,608,5 months,4 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

They have brought some semblance of comfort to our family during an impossibly difficult time. We are especially grateful for the funds being raised for Cory and Maran’s boys: Brycen, Benton, and Braedan. Our hearts ache knowing that Maran’s sons will grow up without their incredible Mom. As many of you know, shortly after bringing Braedan into this world, Maran suffered a catastrophic bleed in her brain from a suspected AVM. Despite her medical team’s best efforts and timely care, we eventually learned that her injury was so significant that there was no chance of recovery. Maran’s wish was to have her organs donated, should a terrible situation like this ever come to be. We have honoured this wish, and know that in passing, Maran has continued to do what she did best – take care of others. There is still much work to be done to support her husband and three sons, including a newborn baby. Your contributions to this campaign have helped us to feel that Maran’s beautiful young family will be well cared-for, despite her untimely death. Maran was, simply put, a wonderful person. This page is a testament to the many lives she has touched in both her work and personal life. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support.

Medical,3,Jeremiah's Battle For His Life,https://www.gofundme.com/ccu35y-help-with-financial-burdens,"METAIRIE, LA","April 4, 2018","$250,000","$132,750","Jeremiah’s Battle for His Life“Definitely the underdog here,” was how Jeremiah’s oncologist described his cancer. “Got to fight harder.” Preliminary pathology suggests that Jeremiah’s cancer is Osteoblastic Osteosarcoma, a bone cancer resistant to radiation.Jeremiah (16) is used to being the underdog. He suffered the loss of his mother to cancer when a little boy. His father is in fulltime ministry to abolish abortion, so financial struggles were a normal part of growing up. He’s from a large homeschooling family of thirteen brothers and sisters. The youngest of five brothers who all played football, Jeremiah learned to fight. Years of losing on the football field trained him to fight hard. His hard work paid off. He is an all-star, state champion. But it was his love for Jesus and the family ministry to abolish abortion that taught him to fight harder. Now he’s in the battle for his life. In July 2017, Jeremiah rededicated his life to Christ and was baptized at an Operation Save America ministry event in Louisville, Kentucky. In March 2018 he was diagnosed with cancer. The MRI revealed two tumors on Jeremiah’s spine, between zones T6 and T7. Picture a pair of hands pressing together, crushing his nerve endings. These tumors are in addition to the one in his chest. Without surgery, the tumors will cause Jeremiah to be permanently paralyzed from the waist down. With surgery, there is a still risk of paralysis because of the location of the tumors. He can also lose the ability to go to the bathroom normally. Finally, following a successful surgery there is no guarantee that Jeremiah will regain the mobility he’s lost. According to the neurosurgeon this type of surgery has a range of outcomes. Some patients regain the former use of their legs. Others do not. The goal of the surgery is to stop further paralysis.Following the surgery, Jeremiah will then face the monster of cancer. He has a tumor in his chest and two spots on his lungs. Jeremiah is in severe pain, without proper medication. His pain radiates down his back and around his side, so he cannot lie on his back or turn to the side. With the tumor in his chest, he cannot lie on his stomach. Often the only relief he finds is standing- but with the tumors in his back causing paralysis that is no longer possible.But as Jeremiah’s father, Rusty explained to the oncologist, “With God all things are possible.” Jeremiah’s bone cancer is aggressive. Whereas the tumor is his chest was a barely noticeable under his skin, it is now the size of an lemon that can be cupped in a hand. Its growth seems to have happened almost overnight; Jeremiah’s pain is growing too, radiating throughout his body. Jeremiah is a brave young man. There is no anger, self-pity or a woes is me attitude . He is more concerned about how others are feeling. When he sees his mother’s concern, he forces a smile or winks. When he sees a worried friend, he stops what he’s doing to pray for them. He posts daily Scripture verse to encourage those who are praying for him and who are following his story on social media. Jeremiah posted this prayer on Facebook:I don’t deserve Your healing but Lord You will always deserve my praise. Through death or life, may Your great name be lifted up and everything that is of me fall to the waste side. Oh Lord, strengthen me that I may fight the battle with a courage Satan cannot tamper with. If You take me home or leave me here to fight a little longer, may it be Your breath in my lungs and Your song on my tongue. Lord I consecrate myself to the full advancement of the Kingdom of God! Lord, I love You and I can’t wait to see You face to face. Amen.As you can imagine, fighting this battle is taking resources the family doesn’t have. Your love, prayers, and support are greatly appreciated.Matthew 19:26 reads, ""Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible'.”The Thomas nation’s stand is simply, they are entrusting the life of their son to the Lord. They believe for a miracle. But even if, that does not take place, they want everyone to know, their faith in Jesus Christ is not for sale and non-negotiable.

Upon being rushed to the hospital via ambulance to Lascolinas Medical city and then they asked to join in Plano Medical city, they discovered tumor in her brain. After doing an initial CT scan and finding a massive mask, apart from her fluctuating levels of sugar, sodium and potassium; they performed an MRI and found a tumor between her brain and skull and in between the optic nerves, which was removed after 2 surgeries, one performed through nose and other through open brain surgery and there is still considerable amount of tumor.While we are praying for the best possible scenario to be that the doctors can remove all the tumor, there is a chance that if it is unable to be completely removed because of the location, my mom will need to undergo radiation.My brother also had to drop his course, as my mom needs good care and support (and his course fee is due still of around 8000$).It's already been around 90 days of her suffering in hospital while she is being treated for her brain tumor and mask, suddenly she got to suffer from Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), as she got infected from E. coli bacteria due to high dosage of antibiotics which is a serious addressable condition which leads to sudden drop of blood platelets and slowly effects the other body parts. It's a very rare case and the doctors suggested that the only way to increase her blood platelets is to give her the course of HUS medicine for a year-long from now which is 1 sitting per month which costs around 25,000$/sitting, and “not at all being covered by insurance”.

This beautiful little soul was born on April 24 to her absolutely amazing parents Harry (Hürrem)  and Parla.Ergan Family , We love them! They are the kindest people you will meet.Sienna was born with an extremely rare case of Extreme Congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Only 20 cases have been seen around the world with this severity. On top of that she also has another heart condition called AV Heart Block causing fast and chaotic heartbeats. These rapid heartbeats might trigger a sudden fainting spell or seizure, and in some cases it can beat erratically for so long that it can cause sudden death.Only three hours after she was born, she was transferred to the NICU where she decompensated quickly with suspension of breathing (apnea) and bradycardia.  She was emergency intubated and CPR was initiated. Within hours, she had gone through her first heart surgery and received a pacemaker. She has been sedated and paralyzed since Day 1. She is still at Pediatric Cardio-Thoracic ICU showing the world how strong she is. During this last month, unfortunately her heart stopped pumping two more times (cardiac arrests) but Sienna has the strongest will to live and with your prayers and support still continues her fight.Since her condition is so rare, doctors do not have a lot of prior cases by which to understand the exact course of action and therefore have to take things day by day. They continue to monitor, treat, and work tirelessly in the hopes that she can survive and grow to a point where her heart is more stable. If you are a parent, or even if you are not, you can try to imagine the dark times that her loving parents who just gave her life are going through.  Sienna is hospitalized at UCLA, and her strong and amazing young parents are not leaving her bedside. No one is really thinking about the financial sacrifice, the medical bills which will reach millions of dollars in desperately trying to save this little angel's life. All the energy is focused on keeping her stable so she can join us all here on earth. There is no price for that. Both parents have left everything aside and therefore are not earning any income during this critical time. Money alone is not what will save Sienna but it will sure help the family and reduce some of the obvious stress they are facing.As a parent myself, trying to keep calm just watching my kid scrape his knee while playing, I can not even imagine the strength her parents need to manage while going through this horrible time.Please, Please, Please help with whatever you can give here. Remember, its just money, it means Absolutely Nothing when it comes to life.  Sienna's middle name, Alexa, means strong defender. Let's help her wake up and smile. She will appreciate every single one of you for helping her survive, and she deserves to.They have identified the top pediatric cardiologists in the world who have done so much for her already, who can broaden her treatment with Advanced Genetic Studies and save her life but we need your help. Just as a quick final note, when I started this campaign the Ergan family did not know I started this campaign for them. It could be embarrassing to ask for help and I did not discuss this with them prior as I knew they would say no, but I can assure you that they can use all the help they can get, and this is a chance for each and every one of you to make a positive impact on their lives and help Sienna go through this.THANK YOU AND PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!Shai Ash￼",931,7.4k,10,997,3 months,12 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She had a persistent cough and began feeling weak and tired after any physical exertion.

She finally went to the doctor’s office where they performed a chest x-ray that showed fluid on her lungs, leading them to believe she had pneumonia. That news finally convinced her to stay home sick from work. Over the next two days her condition grew dramatically worse. The Doctor finally ordered her in for a CT scan which lead to an echocardiogram, which lead to her being admitted to the emergency room in Anchorage on Friday May 18th. The doctors informed us that her heart was only functioning at 10% efficiency, and the fluid in her lungs and swelling in her abdomen were actually an edema caused by her weak heart not being able to pump fluids properly.  After spending two days in the cardiac intensive care unit where more testing was conducted, the Anchorage cardiologists told us they had ordered an emergency medevac from Anchorage to the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. Two hours later we were in a jet headed South. Upon arriving at UWMC they ran every test under the sun and declared there is no real chance that her heart is going to heal on its own. They took her into surgery and installed a temporary heart pump to keep her other organs from shutting down while they figure out a way forward. Today the lead cardiac doctor informed us that she will have to have a more permanent pump installed and she will be placed on the heart transplant list. She is currently at the top of the list based on how sick her heart is, but because she has type O blood, she can only accept other type O hearts. They gave us an estimated wait of six months to a year to find a suitable heart, but also said there’s really just no way to know how long it could take. One could become available tonight. Either way, the road ahead is going to be exceedingly difficult for Kristin and our entire family. We will have to sell our home in Eagle River and relocate close to Seattle so that we can be close to the hospital if a heart becomes available, or if something goes wrong with the battery operated heart pump she will be wearing every second of every day until the donor heart arrives. She will not be able to continue working, but hopefully I can get a transfer to Renton, SeaTac, or some other airport in the area.  This brings me to the bush I’ve been trying to beat around. We simply can not afford all of the costs we are about to accrue. I have no idea how much of this million dollar (I wish I was exaggerating) procedure will be covered by our insurance, but I am certain that they will not cover the cost of us having to relocate to Seattle, and with Kristin not being able to work for the foreseeable future, we are officially living outside our means. Just before we left Anchorage, the head cardiac nurse came in the room and gave us a talk about what we should expect. One thing she hit on several times was that we had to start a crowd fund as soon as possible, because not even the best insurance covers all the unforeseen costs associated with a heart transplant and the life changes that follow. Several other people who we love and respect told us the same, so I’m taking their advice. I’m coming with my hat in my hand, more afraid than I’ve ever been of anything in my life. I made this page on the advice a woman who’s seen many families suffer from the monetary burden of heart transplant surgery and the subsequent treatment. I feel embarrassed and ashamed to even ask for money, but if it gives my wife a better shot at living a happy, healthy life, I will do whatever it takes. If you can spare a couple bucks, we would be more grateful than I can possibly ever tell you. If not, we completely understand. Please just keep my Beautiful Wife in your thoughts and prayers.

The incident occurred on the north ridge of Mount Conness, where Adrien was climbing at around 11,400 feet, near the base of the Conness Glacier. He was scrambling up a talus field to the base of the climbing route when a large rock, weighing around 4,000 pounds, gave way and pinned his leg against a boulder below.Thanks to the efforts of two hikers who were nearby, the Mono County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue were able to locate Adrien, and after some difficulty launching their own helicopter due to heavy smoke in the area, they were able to free Adrien and evacuate him, with the help of a National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk that was close by on fire assignment.When Adrien arrived at the Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, he was in critical condition, but thanks to the hospital's medical staff, and the quick thinking of the hikers who first reported his location, his life was saved. Tragically, they had no choice but to amputate his right leg above the knee.Everyone at Hagens Berman Axeon is deeply saddened by the news and our thoughts and prayers are with Adrien's family and friends at this difficult time.We have set up this page to help with medical expenses and are asking the cycling community to join our efforts.

From all of us working on jim's recovery support team thank you so much for all of your generosity, shares and prayers. We knew we could raise this money but we are all awed that we were able to raise it this quickly. We thoughtfully came up with our goal amount by discussing future anticipated costs with Stephanie. We did our best to come up with an accurate monetary reflection of what recover would look like for jim and his family. However the reality is we don't exactly know what is in store. We know medical costs will be high and we know there will be an extensive recovery time when jim won't be working. Now that we have raised our goal, let's continue to show the McDonald family our love and support with our continued donations, shares, and prayers. Thank you! Thank you!__________________________________________________Friends, family and wider community, we reach out today with an urgent call for help. Our dear friend, jim mcdonald had a massive heart attack on May 25th while he was traveling in Scotland. A well-hidden flaw in a heart we all know to be a source of joy, love and compassion finally made itself known. In addition to the heart attack he developed a serious complication that resulted in emergency surgery. He is currently in critical but stable condition, is under sedation, and while he is expected to make a full recovery, the journey there will be long. Stephanie and the kids are on their way to Scotland to be with jim now, and are expecting to be there for up to 6 weeks, until jim is allowed to travel home. A heart attack is always a serious and life-threatening emergency, when it happens thousands of miles away, in a foreign country, the difficulties and costs faced by the family multiply infinitely. jim is a husband, and father of three, who supports his family through teaching. We’re asking today for your help in supporting jim, and his family, through this enormously hard moment in time. We need help paying for travel for his wife, Stephanie and their three children. We need your help paying for their time in Scotland during jim’s convalescence. We need help paying for jim’s surgery and recovery time in the hospital. And finally, as Jim begins his recovery, we need your help filling in the gaps that the loss of several months income will mean for his family. It’s a big ask; but if not his community, and his friends, who else? To help keep the McDonalds afloat in this storm is going to take all of us, pitching in, how and where we can. The first, best and most direct help you can give, is through this GoFundme effort. Literally every dollar counts. If jim’s teaching, his herbs, his goodness, his questionable wit, and undeniable enthusiasm has ever touched you, please consider taking this time to show that love back in his time of need. Please share this GoFundMe far and wide: 5 dollars from a stranger matters. 10 bucks from one of your coworkers makes a difference. And finally, in whatever version of prayer you practice, please hold jim and his family in your hearts. Keep the good intentions and healing love flowing so that we can have him back to talking about prog rock soon.We are all so lucky to be a part of jim’s community, be it local or extended around the world. This is our chance to do something together, to rally and support them, so that jim and his family can heal.With our deepest gratitude, jim's recovery support team.............................................................................(also, jim is a very popular man— please understand that Stephanie is overwhelmed, and is asking for privacy so that she can focus on her family.

Medical,4,Help Blanca beat cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/helpblancamorell,"BOSTON, MA","May 2, 2018","$50,000","$120,888","Hello all, My name is Begoña Morell and I am from Madrid, Spain. My sister Blanca Morell has been diagnosed with a very rare kind of cancer and would like to share her story with you. Any donations will go directly to help our parents pay for the medical expenses of her illness.We appreciate your support, prayers, and caring messages more than you can imagine. We would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.————Here is what Blanca would like to transmit to you: My name is Blanca Morell, I am 22 years old, I live in Madrid, Spain, and I have been diagnosed with cancer. I have a type of cancer in my spinal cord called Diffuse Anaplastic Astrocytoma, grade III. It is a very, very unusual cancer, as it is commonly developed by elderly people in the brain, not by young people in the spinal cord. Since it is located in my spinal cord (the part of the nervous system that transmits all of the signals to my extremities) it cannot be operated on, and when treated with radiation or chemotherapy, there is a risk that I will become quadriplegic. Being an atypical cancer, where the nervous system cells degenerate and mutate into fast-growing malignant cells, there is not a definitive treatment or solution. In this type of cancer the malignant cells mix with healthy cells along the entire spinal cord, making it very difficult to eliminate it without damaging the healthy cells.I have already lost sensitivity in my feet and legs, I don't feel anything below my chest, and I cannot walk due to a surgery I went through to be able to do a biopsy, so I must now move in a wheelchair. One of the few treatment options that can be used to fight this cancer is Proton (Radiation) Therapy. It is a very complex and expensive treatment that requires special facilities that cannot be found in Spain, and only exist in very few places in the U.S. and in Europe.Thanks to the love of my parents and their sacrifices, we have moved to Boston so that I can be treated in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where Proton Therapy is available and where there are some of only a few professionals in the world with experience in treating this cancer.The treatment consists on 42 sessions, and costs $300,000 which my parents must pay out of pocket (since neither public nor private insurances in Spain cover these treatments). In addition, there are other expenses such as appointments with my neuro-oncologist and radiotherapist, MRIs, CT simulations, etc. that raise the cost to over $400,000.  Additionally, we need to rent an apartment in Boston for the two months that I must stay for my treatment. I would like to collect funds to help my parents pay for the medical costs of my illness. Thank you so much for your donations and continued support. May God repay you",1.1k,2.3k,2,"1,117",4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Randy was diagnosed with an aggressive sarcoma cancer in his right leg in March 2017, and stopped working as a doctor at that time. Over the last 13 months Randy has undergone 6 different surgeries, had to be admitted for hospitalization on 6 other occasions, he has seen his sarcoma metastasize into his lungs so that he now has Stage 4 cancer, and he has had countless numbers of doctors appointments, treatments (chemo, immunotherapy, hydration, etc.), scans, therapies, etc.Randy's last surgery in January required him to have a complete amputation of his right leg and half of his pelvis as the only option to deal with the sarcoma that could not be controlled otherwise. That procedure alone required Randy to spend a month hospitalized and rehabbing. Fortunately, Randy is feeling better now that the sarcoma was fully removed with his leg, and his lung tumors are decreasing with continued immunotherapy.However, the only path for Randy to regain some normalcy and to be able to go back to work as a leading facial plastic surgeon in the Baltimore area...is to get a prosthetic leg which comes with a $20K copayment that Randy and his family are responsible for.Based on the costs of this prosthetic, and the significant expenses that have accumulated with all of Randy's procedures/appointments described above...Randy and his family are in significant debt and need as much financial assistance as possible. The goal of this fundraising ($50K)...if met...will cover a portion of their expenses incurred so far, and will provide a huge help to Randy and his family (his wife Marisa and two sons - Enzo and Leo).Randy is a private and proud individual, which is why many of you who know Randy are hearing about this for the first time. He had hoped to be able to handle this on his own, but this nefarious cancer he has been fighting for over 13 months now...has proven to be too much financially for Randy and his family to handle on their own. And, they need our collective help to manage the financial obligation of everything that the family has endured so far and continues to deal with.Randy has spent years and countless hours studying to become a renowned Facial Plastic Surgeon so that he could dedicate his professional life to helping hundreds if not thousands of people live a better life. Randy has volunteered his time and services on two separate occasions to go to Mexico and Nicaragua to perform cleft lip and cleft palate repairs, and fix nose and ear birth defects on children who couldn't afford the medical procedures. Randy is also a co-founder and co-director of the Greater Baltimore Cleft Lip & Palate Team, which is a group of providers that performs pro-bono services to Maryland kids with birth defects affecting their face. For those who have never had the pleasure to meet Randy, you would be hard-pressed to meet a friendlier and more caring person. It’s cliché, but Randy “would absolutely” give you the shirt off his back if you needed it and he just met you. Therefore, it is no surprise that Randy persevered to develop the medical skills and expertise to help and make a positive difference in the lives of his patients dealing with various types of facial traumas, defects, reconstructions, etc.Therefore, please consider making a donation to allow him to get the prosthetic leg that he needs to get back to work, to help his family manage the significant debt accumulated from his battle with cancer, and to let Randy do what he does best...make a positive difference in the lives of his patients and everyone he meets.A donation of any kind will be greatly appreciated and a huge help. Also, please feel free to forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in supporting the Capone family cause.Please use the contact information on the page If you have any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of this effort to help Randy and his family.",585,764,14,520,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

On May 23, Jim received a call that his potassium levels were dangerously low, and he should make his way to the ER immediately. Jim was admitted that evening, and since he had not had much of an appetite for a couple weeks, an endoscopy was performed on May 25. The GI doctor biopsied Jim's stomach and told Jim and Mary he was 'very concerned' with what he saw. Given it was Memorial Day weekend, results would take several days to return. Jim went home on Sunday, May 27, knowing he and Mary just had to wait for the results. On Tuesday, May 29, Jim was back in the ER. His legs were cramping, and he felt very tired. Low potassium was the culprit again. And Jim was admitted....again. Finally, on Thursday, May 31, the pathology returned, and cancer of the stomach was confirmed. Jim was released from the hospital on Friday morning. Mary was on the phone with Sloan Kettering throughout the day. They would have to wait until early the following week to hear confirmation of an appointment.On Monday, June 4, Jim really was not feeling well. Eating continued to be a challenge, and he was growing weaker. Mary took him back to the hospital and he was admitted....again. Early Tuesday morning, Sloan Kettering called with an appointment for the upcoming Friday. Yaay! Finally some good news! But Jim had had a rough night, and he continued to decline. Tuesday afternoon, Jim was transported to Vassar Hospital, and there, Jim and Mary received devastating news: Stage 4, diffuse gastric cancer with carcinomatosis to the abdomen. The cancer in Jim's stomach had spread into his abdomen and around his intestines. Absolutely devastating news.Mary and Jim are the best people I know. They give of themselves continuously to anyone in need or any cause - big or small. 'No' is a word they rarely say, and they never ask for anything in return. Now, they really need our help.Jim, Mary, and their four children are facing a frightening diagnosis and are in the midst of a very tough battle. Uncovered medical expenses, regular bills, and daily needs all are looming. Jim is unable to work. And Mary's focus is on Jim and their children, which is exactly where it needs to be. The support and concern of the community have been overwhelming. Mary and Jim are so very moved and appreciative. Many people have asked how they can help. Along with love and prayers, financial support is the best way to help the Hares right now. I ask you to consider a donation at this very difficult time.

Unconscious, she was rushed to Evanston Hospital where doctors identified over 10 cranial fractures. They measured the severity of her comatose state as 3-4 on the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and at one point were not positive on her ever regaining consciousness.Winnie bravely underwent 4 craniotomies and 3 assisted surgeries, fighting through and waking up from her coma on May 4, 2017.The accident resulted in devastating injuries to her brain, causing her to lose her language capabilities and control over the right side of her body. But what adversity was not able to take was her hope, her grit and her courage. She began rehab immediately. She had to learn to sit and walk again through physical therapy. She slowly regained her memory. She initially could only speak her native dialect 2 months post-coma, then slowly learned to speak mandarin again. She re-learned English. Slowly, but surely, she learned to use her left hand to write. When she couldn’t remember simple words, she just kept writing, writing and writing…Winnie’s progress has been miraculously encouraging, but she still has a long way to go before being able to be function independently. Seemingly routine tasks, such as dressing herself, are a struggle because of her paralyzed right side. Her parents left their jobs in China and flew 16 hours around the world to take care of their only child. They have depleted their savings over the last year and are now at a crossroads.As we come together as a Kellogg family, we remember our conversations with Winnie. She spoke of her beginnings growing up in China, her journeys living and working in Hong Kong and her dreams after attending Kellogg. Winnie's tragic experience hits especially close to home - it could have been any one of us crossing Clark Street that day after class. Winnie at KWEST (Kellogg Worldwide Experiences & Service Trips), August 2016We need your help to support Winnie’s medical expenses in the next year so that her dreams post-Kellogg is a detour and not a dead end. Our campaign goal is $100,000. This will be used in the following ways: － Return tickets to China for the family (estimated at $5,000)－ Rehab treatments in China from July to September 2018 (estimated at $15,000) － Rehab treatments in MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center from October 2018 to August 2019 (estimated at $80,000)Thank you for reading Winnie’s story. We appreciate any help or contribution, no matter how big or small! If possible, please share our campaign link on social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and with your friends. We will keep you posted on the use of funds and her progress going forward.  Any questions, please contact helpwinnieyang@hotmail.com.Lastly, we will end with Winnie’s favourite essay, which she took an hour to copy with her left hand: Hope.Message from Winnie's Parents:

Message from Winnie:

FAQ:Who are we and where are we from?This campaign is led by JJ Luo, Li Qiao, Taylor Chen and Michelle Guo, with the help of a group of Winnie's friends at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. We are raising the fund on behalf of Winnie and her family.Why is fundraising for Winnie necessary now?Winnie’s medical expenses were covered mostly by her student health insurance (with copay) from March, 2017 until now. However, Winnie’s health insurance will end as we graduate this summer, 2018. Her current conditions still require rigorous therapies. She’s unable to complete simple everyday tasks due to the paralysis of her right side. Her energy level tends to run low. Her languages capabilities are improving but still not fluent to communicate effectively in daily life. She and her family were initially hopeful about the legal claims. Unfortunately, she will only receive approximately $60,000 from the accident lawsuit (total amount to be determined in the next 1-2 months). She has no health insurance in China. Over the past 16 months, her parents have exhausted their savings and had to borrow money from friends and family to take care of Winnie in the U.S.. Because Winnie requires full-time care, her parents are unable to work and have no income. Her parents are also having health issues. Very recently, her mom had to take out a loan to undergo an emergent gallstone surgery because she had no health insurance in US. Why does Winnie have to leave the U.S.?Winnie’s student visa status, and health insurance in the U.S. will end this summer. While she’d like to continue to rehab in the U.S., she has to return to China at the end of June.How has Winnie progressed since she got out of her coma?When first waking up from her coma, Winnie recognized no one. She was unable to balance herself sitting up, or speak.She slowly regained her memory. She initially could only speak her native dialect 2 months post-coma, then slowly learned to speak mandarin again. She also re-learnt English. She had to learn to sit and walk again through physical therapy. Now, she can walk with crutches and use her left hand to write and type.Her cognitive progress is promising too. For example, she improved from doing only 1 GMAT question per hour to completing 10 questions per hour in merely a few months.Prior to April 2018, she rehab 5 times a week. Since this May, it was cut to 3 times due to her encouraging progress.What is Winnie’s current condition and daily schedules?After one full year of rehab, Winnie has exceeded her doctor’s expectations. She can now walk with a crutch, use her left hand to write and comprehend course materials. She even audited two classes at Kellogg during the spring of 2018.She goes to the rehab center three times a week. Each session is 3 hours, practising speaking, walking and control of her right hand. Every day, she repeats the efforts at home. In addition, she practises writing, reading and critical thinking analysis at home.What is Winnie’s plan in the future one year?Winnie plans to undergo treatments in Guizhou, China from July to September 2018, before she transfers to MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center in Hong Kong (recommended by her doctors) to continue rehab until August 2019. Why does she choose to head to Hong Kong?Winnie is a Hong Kong citizen. MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center in Hong Kong has been recommended by her doctors. The center will continue Winnie’s rehab with speeches, Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT).

When she hit her 20's, she found out she carried the gene Ankylosing Spondylitis, which is arthritis affecting the spine and large joints within the body. To treat this, she was taking Humera, an immunosuppressant that weakens the immune system. Because of this, she had contracted a cold, which turned into bacterial and viral pneumonia that put her in the hospital for a month. During that month she had acquired sepsis, a life threatening blood infection. This lowered her chance of living from 70% to 30% in a matter of days, then to 15%. To save her life, they put her on Levophed, a drug which helps regulate blood pressure; it shunted all of the blood from her extremities to her major organs to keep her alive. This resulted in a quadruple amputation. A quadruple amputation is very rare, but necessary. All 4 prosthetics she will need comes to $225,000, which is not covered by her insurance. Tiffany is currently engaged Moe Fonohema. She's been the most humble, positive light that our family has ever had and we've been blessed to welcome her into the family. She is 38 with 6 amazing kids: Nesi 27 (adopted from our family), Davontae 19, Inoke 16, Robbie 10, Mckelvey 7, and Jamison 4. They've been together for 4 years, and all 4 years she's become the biggest blessing our family has had, from letting us have family parties in her own home to letting us feel as though her home was our home. These last 3 months have been difficult for our family because we were dangerously close to losing her. At this point, the medical bills, the cost of the prosthetics, the renovating of the home to accommodate to Tiffany and other things that our family will need to financially support her family, we need all the financial support we can get. There is no one you'll find more deserving, more loving and humble than Tiffany Fonohema. We APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU. She especially sends her love.  If you can't help financially, your love and support is just as appreciated and necessary. Whatever you can donate, it is treasured in every way possible. Lets get Tiffany walking again, back to a normal life again, together. There are plentiful social media platforms, so share where you can and we can achieve this goal together.

I was living a great and happy life in New York City with my wife of two years, had a soaring career in software sales, and a deep passion for running and sailing; Until everything changed.In March 2017, I noticed my right foot wasn’t keeping up with my left and was causing me to trip. I didn’t think much of it until my primary care doctor told me this was a much more serious issue and referred me to the first of what would be many neurologists. I was tested for everything from AIDS to Zika. MRI’s, CT scans, EMG’s, blood tests and painful spinal taps - The results were inconclusive, and the bills were piling up rapidly. The fear of the unknown was causing all sorts of stress – Weight loss, sleeplessness, lack of focus, and the depression was starting to get worse. Still not receiving answers, I enrolled in the second opinion program at the Mayo Clinic. Guided by Dr. Andrew McKeon, my parents and I spent a week in frigid Rochester, MN repeating all the painful tests hoping for answers. As every test result came in, we tried everything we could to interpret each result. We laughed and cried with happiness when we thought it was something simple and panicked and cried together when the simple things were ruled out. We were physically exhausted from the emotional ups and downs. On the last day at Mayo, January 5th, 2018, I was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).Now 38 years old, my world has been turned upside down. My body was quickly failing me. My balance and walking were affected making me fall many times; my hands could barely hold a fork or type an email; And getting dressed was nearly impossible. The fear and anxiety of daily living were increasingly more paralyzing. Moving to my parents house in order to receive the extraordinary care I would need to live out the hardest time in my life meant leaving everything about my life in New York City behind.  I was crushed.A New Chapter and Where We Need your HelpAfter making the transition to my parent’s house, it became obvious the house was not set up to accommodate someone with my needs. Things you don’t typically think about, like widening doorways, renovating the bathroom so I can roll in with the wheelchair, adding ramps, and installing stair lifts to get me from one floor to another. This doesn’t even touch on the need for wheelchairs, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, lawyers, in-home nursing and technological devices to cope with my failing body. None of this is covered by insurance. How Can You Help?We need your support to make the changes necessary and cover the costs of things that insurance won’t. Because of the progression of this disease, we need your support as soon as possible.Please help us reach our goal by sharing this fundraising campaign on your Facebook and Instagram with your friends, family, and colleagues.ALS, also known as Motor Neuron Disease or Lou Gehrig's Disease, has no cure, yet. The average lifespan from diagnosis is two to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for my family and me. What I do know is that I’m focused on doing everything I can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages. As many of my family, friends and coworkers know, I have a strong positive mental attitude and a passion for life. So as difficult and sad as this diagnosis is, I remain positive, and I gather my strength from the outpouring of love and well-wishes from my family and friends, my employer, PerfectoMobile.com, and the men’s group, MDI (mentordiscoverinspire.org ).No one knows how long my fight will last, however I have the will and determination to battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this is already creating a tremendous financial burden on me and my family.  I need your generous help with contributions to help me fight this awful disease and to allow me to have the highest quality of life possible.

Recovery seemed to be going well until three weeks later, when Peter had a devastating stroke while in his doctor’s office. The stroke trauma team worked quickly, but Peter is still facing a long road to recovery. Peter has significant weakness on his left side, which affects his arm and leg, limiting his mobility. Insurance paid for 100 days in a good rehab center with occupational, physical, and speech therapy daily. He had hoped to go home, but that was not in the cards. He’s now in assisted living, with its nursing and aid support, which he needs and which insurance doesn’t pay for. So, from here on out, those costs fall to Peter and Marge. He’ll continue to seek out additional rehabilitation services for PT and OT. He is doing some walking, about 75 steps per session, with the help of a walker and a physical therapist. Slow but steady. Though his body has taken some hard blows, Peter's determination, wit, and humor remain in good form.While Peter and Marge focus their energies on the demands of recovery, many friends and fans of this gifted music-maker are pulling for them wholeheartedly and want to help.

ALS is insidious, robbing its victims of the ability to walk, dress themselves, talk, swallow, and ultimately breathe. All while leaving the mind perfectly intact. Already, I’ve lost all use of my left arm and approximately 60% of my right.  ALS has no cure and no effective treatment. The average lifespan from diagnosis is three to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for me and my family. What I do know is that I’m focused on doing everything I can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages. As many know, I have a passion for life. So as difficult and sad as this diagnosis is, I remain positive and gather my strength from the outpouring of love and well-wishes from my family and friends.I’m an outdoors enthusiast and enjoy many activities like fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, skiing and golf. I played football in high school (team captain) and college and have always been passionate about sports. I love live music and have been known to enjoy a concert from time to time. Even though ALS has limited my activities, I continue to find ways to enjoy life by surrounding myself with friends and family. My faith and positive outlook allow me to take it “One Day at a Time” and live one of my favorite mottos “Tour for Life”. On this journey, my family will face extraordinary medical and incidental expenses. ALS treatment is not covered by insurance and estimates for medical costs alone range from $200,000-$300,000 each year, covering ventilation, feeding tubes and in-home care. Additional large expenses may include moving to a new home with greater accessibility, wheelchairs, lifts, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, aides/in-home nursing and technological devices to offset muscle paralysis. No one knows how long my fight will last, but I’m assuming I’ll battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this will leave a tremendous financial burden on me and my family.My wife Peyton and I have three children, and while they may receive some financial aid for college due to my diagnosis, it’s likely that we will still face over $250,000 in additional expenses to finance their educations. It pains me think I will be placing such a burden on them.Peyton and I have dedicated our lives to raising our family and giving whatever possible to the community in New Canaan, CT.

The bottom line is that we felt the situation has degraded in recent months, and Joe was nearing a likely catastrophic outcome.  We hired a professional addiction counselor to travel to Chicago and convince Joe to enter an extended 90+-day program in Florida that is designed for long-term alcoholics who cannot beat the disease.I am extremely pleased to report to you all that we worked with the counselor, Joe’s family, and the new program to transport him down to Florida on June 18 where he officially started this new long-term recovery program.  For now, he is out of Chicago and in safe hands, ideally recovering for good.  I am writing to ask all of you for your help.  We hope Joe will be in Florida for years to come, but no way to know for sure.  If you are in Florida and can visit him, please make time to go see him.  If you have a company that can hire him after his 3-6 month program, please try to do that (he is an MIT grad MBA and a star-man after all!)  Plus we’ve got about $55K of known expenses related to this program.  But we also want to provide him post-program monitoring, counseling, career options, and financial support in order to give him an out-sized chance at a sustained recovery this time.  All-in, we’d like to raise a minimum of $55K to cover the program, with a target of $100K to provide an extended timeline of care and support.  CNQ, this is a rare opportunity where we all have a chance to significantly help a dear classmate and friend before you receive that dreaded graduate death notice in your inbox.   Please donate what you can to help, and check back….if we have not raised our target, please keep giving.  And we ask that you don’t be anonymous, add a note to Joe and show your name and $ amount, large or small, so all can see how we came together as a class to help a friend.  Thank you all for your consideration.  Go Army, CNQ86 rules.Dean Dorman and John Noble",371,150,6,373,1 month,10 days ago,8 days,2018-09-03

I had just moved to Northern Virginia for an engineering job and was pursuing a part-time MBA degree at Georgetown University.I had tons of energy and a positive attitude towards life. On January 6, 2011, I went to the ER with vision problems (blurred and turning sight) and severe shortness of breath. I was told that my lungs were full of blood clots and suspicious nodules. My doctor was surprised I made it alive to the hospital. More scans revealed that I also had a 10x10 tumor in my retroperitonium completely blocking the flow of blood in my IVC and liver lesions. I was diagnosed with Stage 3C testicular cancer. I was immediately taken to surgery. A few days later, I started chemotherapy.  I had lots of complications because I was too sick. After finishing my chemo, I went to Indiana to remove the remaining mass in my abdomen, known as an RPLND surgery. Unfortunately, my remission only lasted 20 months. I was devastated once again when I learned that cancer was back at my regular check=up with my oncologist. I started a different chemo regimen this time, but it failed. After visiting two centers of excellence, I found out that my only option left was to have High Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Transplants. On December 22, 2013, I enrolled in a research trial and started my treatment in Houston, TX.  Unfortunately, the treatment was so toxic that I lost my liver, kidneys and almost my mind with hallucinations and toxins in my body. I developed sepsis right around Christmas, said farewell to my dear parents, and closed my eyes. Miraculously,  I did not die. But, I was totally and permanently disabled with end-stage liver and kidney disease, for which, I had to do dialysis three times a week. I subsequently had two lung surgeries since cancer kept coming back. Since my last surgery, it has been almost three years that I am cancer-free. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy life with my disabling conditions, too many to write here.  Cirrhosis led to significant ascites that had to be removed by the gallons.  I finally got listed for a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant. My score is relatively high that I am at or near the top of the list depending on the week's blood work results. I may finally be able to get back to a relatively normal life and perhaps even work again. However, not having worked for five years, my condition has put me and my parents in a financial constraint. The costs associated with a transplant are very high, particularly with the life-long expensive medications one needs to take. So, with all that, I and my family would appreciate your support. It is fairly difficult for me to write openly about myself and ask for help.  If you are not able to make a donation, please send your good thoughts and encouragements. We appreciate all your kindness and support at this difficult time. I look forward to becoming a healthy and productive member of our society once again.",610,1.8k,0,613,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

After a trip to the emergency room, a battery of tests and scans, and a lot of agonizing waiting for results, Gerard was diagnosed with both kidney and colon cancer. The devastating news hit Gerard, Nicky and their three small children, Elizabeth, Gina and Stephanie, very hard. But in true Franchi fashion, they immediately took to fighting cancer head on. After Gerard’s abdominal and kidney surgeries, rounds of chemotherapy and many prayers, he received the news that he was all clear! Gerard had beaten cancer.Fast forward to October 23, 2017. On a routine follow-up scan 3 months after Gerard was given the “all clear”, the doctors once again found tumors. At that time the cancer had spread to Gerard’s stomach and liver. Gerard continues to receive chemotherapy treatment at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Currently due to his compromised immune system, Gerard has had to miss or delay treatments. As always, he remains focused on the task of fighting this awful disease. He is determined to overcome the odds. The old adage of ”taking it one day at a time” has never rung more true for Gerard, his family and friends. Gerard’s positive outlook on an uncertain future is inspiring. Despite the emotional rollercoaster of the past year and a half, Gerard continues to embody what it means to be a fighter, a husband and a father.The Franchi's have made it through these trying times with the love and support of their family and friends and their faith in God. Everyone around them has been extremely generous whether in the form of gift cards, meals, donations or a simple phone call to check in. The constant outpouring of care and love has meant the world to them. The reality of a fight such as this and Gerard’s determination to provide for his family, has continued to push him forward.After careful discussion with Gerard’s medical team the decision has been made for Gerard to stop working. Chemotherapy has taken a great toll on his body and immune system. This is a very emotional and difficult decision for Gerard. His brother Bobby, and everyone at R.A.Franchi Corp. made it possible for Gerard to work up until this point,he could not have done it without you.As of July 1st , Gerard will begin the 5-month waiting period prior to receiving Social Security Disability benefits. This campaign is in place to help lessen the financial burden on the Franchi family during this exceptionally challenging time. Thank you for supporting this beautiful family. #franchistrong",717,1.6k,4,724,2 months,1 month ago,1 month,2018-09-03

After investigating a stiff neck, something didn't ""sit right"" with our amazing pediatrician and she ordered blood-work. Follow up blood work in the Hackensack ER turned from just anemia to a small mass on his kidney to a CT Scan that showed a much bigger problem. Every corner we have turned has been devastating. We are currently residents of the Pediatric Oncology Department at Hackensack University Medical Center and are being treated by a very very large team of Doctors, NPs, Nurses, Techs, and more specialists than you can imagine.

This is the only desire for 34-year old mom, Leena, from the moment she gets up in the morning to the second she falls asleep.  Just a month ago, Leena was suffering from prolonged cold-like symptoms and finally ended up in an urgent care facility. She was found to have a mass in her lung and was sent directly to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. They had found a large tumor in her right lung. For Leena, a non-smoker, and her husband, Kuldeep, this was earth-shattering news. They lived a simple life, a family of three with little Neel being the center of their hearts.  The diagnosis was absolutely devastating. They went from thinking this was a persistent cold to being told that she has advanced lung cancer. Since then it has been a roller-coaster ride for the family, running around and working with a network of friends trying to identify the right hospital, oncologists and, most importantly, the treatment path to cure this evil disease.In the following days, Leena went through a series of biopsies, scans and other tests.  Every visit to a hospital and lab became a nightmare for the family as it brought more devastating and scarier news.  Also, taking along a baffled little Neel to the hospitals with his mom instead of his pre-K classes is no small task, as you can imagine.  Two days later, a brain scan revealed more shattering news- a 2.5 cm tumor was found in her brain.  Furthermore, scans showed that the cancer had spread to her abdomen. She was told she had Stage IV disease. There was no time for them to think, ""Why me?""  On April 27th, Leena was admitted to the George Washington University Hospital.  She was lucky to find one of the best neurosurgeons to remove her tumor.  He was set to go on vacation but decided to take on her case.  With the blessing of guru P.P.

They are the kindest-hearted and most generous people in the world, and now it is our chance to help them as they have helped so many others. They have been traveling a very tough road for a while now, and unfortunately more difficult times lay ahead. Kim’s 100-mile charitable races have been replaced with a struggle to complete the simplest of daily tasks.  After a very long period of uncertainty, misdiagnoses and straight-up dismissal of obvious symptoms, Kim D’Arcy was finally diagnosed with Severe Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease (CNL) and several other co-infections know as babesia and bartonella. Kim is now living with a host of multi-systemic neurological and physical ailments including debilitating fatigue, profound memory loss, extreme migraine-like symptoms, severe pain and swelling in her joints, night sweats, body spasms, and breathing issues.  She is undergoing very intense treatments on a daily basis in hopes of killing off the spirochetes that make up Lyme disease and co-infections.  She had a PICC line implanted in Oct 2017 and is being treated with intravenous IVs five days a week, as well tons of AM and PM oral antibiotics.   While there are many parts of this chapter in their lives that straight up suck, one of the most difficult is how hard it has hit them financially. Outrageously, Chronic Neurological Lyme is not recognized by the CDC in the US and therefore treatment is not covered by insurance companies. So ALL of the expenses in testing, diagnosing and treating Kim’s very legitimate illness have been paid OUT OF POCKET by the family. This, as you can imagine, is an expense that is beyond the scope of imagination for any of us and is ruinously unsustainable.  Kim is going to be faced with approximately 2 more years of treatments, possibly more. Additionally, Kim and John’s two beautiful children, Lilly and Jack, will have to undergo their own rounds of intense testing as Kim’s strain of Lyme could have been transferred to them in-utero. These kids are ROCKSTARS and have been through more than their fair share of hardships for such little loves.The goal is to raise $60,000.00 to help with the family’s medical expenses now and for the next couple of years. After comprehensive research and consultation with doctors and specialists, due to the severity of her condition, Kim has been advised to enter an intensive treatment center in Germany where she has been offered a spot at the St. George Klinik. Germany recognizes Chronic Neurological Lyme disease as a major health issue and the clinic there offers a state-of-the-art Hyperthermia Treatment program that has been very successful in treating others with this debilitating disease. Kim and John have been in direct contact with some of these patients and their results have been amazingly positive. Because of her advanced stage of this disease, Kim must take action NOW. Her spot at St. George is guaranteed for June 25th! The treatment is done over a three week period, it is very expensive and it is not covered by insurance.  They need our support to get Kim well and give them all a last chance to return to a normal life. Will you please join me in helping out the D’Arcy family, who have always been there for others? They would never ask for themselves, so I am asking for them – let’s be there for them… no family could be more deserving.  For more info on this treatment and testimonials of those who have successfully been though the process please click here:  www.St-george-hospital.com",465,622,0,467,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Medical,7,Garrett Roe fund,https://www.gofundme.com/garrett-roe-fund,"SANTA ANA, CA","August 11, 2018","$100,000","$86,882","On Thursday, August 9, my fiancé, Garrett Roe, suffered a stroke at the age of 32. He is alive thanks to the wonderful staff at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, however words can not describe how devastated we are. Garrett is an A320 First Officer for JetBlue and is based in Long Beach, CA. He was born and raised in the state of Washington. Garrett has always had a passion for airplanes and he started flying at the age of 18.  When not in the air he enjoys boating, mechanics, working out, and spending time with friends.  His positive energy and generousity are an inspiration to all who know him.  On August 9th, Garrett woke up with complaints of a headache. He got up, made coffee and went in to the bathroom to get ready for work. Seconds later, I glanced over and saw him on his stomach using the door frame to pull himself out of the bathroom. The look on his face was a look I will never forget. I ran over to him and his eyes were open but moving side to side, and he was drooling and clenching his jaw. His body was overly tense and he kept trying to stand but could not. When the medics arrived, they made the decision to airlift him to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. The helicopter landed at Harborview and within 10 minutes of landing Garrett had had a brain scan where they located the clot, and was undergoing surgery where it was successfully removed.  Garrett ended up suffering from an ischemic stroke caused by a carotid artery dissection. This means that he had a tear in the 2 inner layers of his carotid artery...the blood pooled and formed a clot. The clot then traveled to the brain and caused him to have a stroke. Approximately one-third of the left hemisphere of his brain developed damage. This has caused paralysis of the entire right side of his body and the inability to talk and communicate. This is the start of a very long road for Garrett. He will need immense therapy and rehab to get his body working again coupled with a large amount of support from family and friends to keep his spirits high. His mother Tanya, and I appreciate all of the love and support we have already received! This is going to take an army but with strength, love and prayer we are confident that we will get Garrett back to the way he was!I will be updating along the way as we go through this journey together.

Rainier, the highest mountain in the State of Washington · Become a top salesperson at one of the most successful technology start-ups in the history of Seattle · Become an avid addict of physical endurance, including daily visits to his local cross-fit gym · Strived to become a model for fuel efficiency with his ownership of awkwardly massive trucks (that one's a joke - but not really...;) In early 2016 the tumor had advanced and by the end of the year had transformed into a stage 4 terminal Glioblastoma.  (Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM ), to be specific)  Since that time, it's been a roller-coaster of highs and lows for Mike, for his friends, and especially for his family.   The one take-away most of us close friends and family share is our awe of Mike's undaunted strength and relentless fight through this time.  The guy is a Clydesdale -there is no other person on earth who could have fought this thing harder.  It's been both admirable and heartbreaking to watch... Two of the things that weighed heaviest on Mike throughout this time was the legacy he’d leave behind to his kids, and what he would be able to do to care for his family after he was gone.  Many of the people reading this will undoubtedly be involved in the legacy part.  We'll ensure that his kids be exposed to all of the things that made their dad smile, we'll ensure they know the man their father was, how much he cared for them, and they'll know the tremendous amount of love he had for both of them.As it pertains to the concern about taking care of his family, well, that's what this is about.   This is a call-out for any and all people who ever knew Mike and Agnes, who were friends to them, family to them, who worked with them or may have met them through other mutual friends.  This is our chance to make a splash.  This is our chance to support Mike's wishes and show this family the support group that they have.  Mike passed away Wednesday, May 23rd at 12:12am at his home. He was surrounded by his family and loved ones. His passing was peaceful and without pain. Even though the family has insurance, the out of pocket expenses are piling up and staggering.  As friends to the family, we feel the least we can do in this situation is to help take some of this off of their plate ,and see to it that they receive the utmost support.  All of the money raised from this campaign will go towards the family’s everyday costs associated with Mike’s illness.This is your chance to help.

Medical,7,Proton Therapy for Zach Rizzuto,https://www.gofundme.com/zachproton,"FORT MYERS, FL","March 25, 2018","$125,555","$126,635","My husband Zach was an otherwise healthy 37-year old man until summer 2017. Zach was diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2017, just less than three months after the birth of our daughter, Roxanne. He has undergone three brain surgeries - one biopsy and two craniotomies - to diagnose and resect a huge brain tumor. The tumor has been diagnosed with brain cancer, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III ) to be exact.  This campaign was created to help us raise money for his proton beam radiaton therapy treatment since his health insurance carrier denied it because their medical directors, Dr. Ellen Rabun and Dr. Joan Huppi , claimed the treatment is unproven and not medically necessary. We disagree. More importantly, Zach's doctors in Philadelphia and Fort Myers disagree. So, we're reaching out to you for help. Thanks in advance for reading our story!Three institutions reviewed Zach’s MRI scans and pathology - Gulf Coast Medical Center, Duke University, and the University of Pennsylvania . The recommended treatment for his condition is tumor resection surgery followed by 6-weeks of radiation and chemo (Temodar), and then 12-months of chemo maintenance. Zach can receive either photon radiation or proton radiation, but we appealed UnitedHealthcare to approve the proton radiation three times because it uses a lower dose of radiation which can reduce the long and short-term side effects, including protecting cognitive abilities and lowering risk for more cancers to develop. It is the preferred treatment due to the location of his tumor cells in his brain. Proton radiation has a reduced side effect profile, which means Zach could have less neurocognitive side effects and the left side of his brain’s healthy tissue would be protected from the damaging effects of radiation. He will experience side effects with either form of radiation but would be able to have a better quality of life if he has proton radiation. This is critical for our family because he is still a young man, has a ten-month-old daughter, and is in the middle of his professional career.We are grateful and appreciate each of you for your kindness, support, and generosity. Thank you for sharing our story with others. I can promise you that we will pay it forward someday. We will also be sure to teach Roxanne about the love that exists in this world and remind her that there are so many good people in her life.We take great pride in being fiscally responsible individuals. We wish we could pay for Zach’s treatment in full with our savings, but we don’t have enough saved, and it would take us too long to get the amount needed without drastically delaying his treatment (and risking tumor regrowth). We also have medical bills from his previous surgeries to pay. His proton treatments will cost $125,554.11. Fifty-percent of his treatment ($62,777.05) must be paid before he can begin. The remaining fifty-percent must be paid in 5 payments of $12,555.41 over five months after treatment. There are no other payment plan options available for proton therapy at Penn. Zach will also receive very little of his income (if any) during his six weeks of treatment because we have to be in Philadelphia. We hope he can return to work fully soon after, and that is one of the main reasons we have been fighting for proton radiation over traditional radiotherapy. There will be neurocognitive side effects for either type of treatment, but they are lessened with proton therapy. Since Zach’s radiation will be on his brain, it is critical to preserve as much healthy brain tissue as possible in order to maintain his quality of life and cognitive functions after treatment.Longer StoryHow did you find it?Zach experienced several confusion/disorientation/staring episodes in 2017, just before and after Roxanne was born. He initially convinced me they were caused by the stress he was under at work. I finally got him to go to a doctor in early August, and an MRI was ordered. We were called back into the office on the same day the MRI was performed. I knew the news could not be good. Thankfully, my mom had been staying with us for a few weeks to help me with Roxanne as I started to transition back to work. We were told Zach had a 7 cm mass (described as huge in the report) on the right temporal lobe of his brain. We now know the episodes he was experiencing were absent seizures. He never even had a headache, which is amazing. We immediately met with oncologists and a neurosurgeon in Florida to find out what to do. A biopsy surgery was performed on August 23rd (when Roxanne was just about 3-months old). His biopsy results were inconclusive because the hospital in FL did not have a neuropathologist on staff, but lymphoma was ruled out. The slides were sent to the Mayo Clinic for an expert consult and his MRI scans were sent to the Duke University Brain Tumor Center.  The initial pathology from the Mayo Clinic indicated the tumor was a low-grade glioma (grade II). The news wasn’t the best or worst we could receive. We waited several weeks for Duke to get back to us and eventually the neurosurgeon called and talked to Zach about removing the tumor. We were not immediately comfortable with the discussion, so I decided on a whim to reach out to the brain tumor program at the University of Pennsylvania since we were going to NJ for my nephew's first birthday anyway. My experience working with a nurse navigator at Penn was impressive. We were able to get three appointments scheduled with experts in less than ten days. The appointments were long but eye-opening, hopeful, and thorough. The surgeon showed us the intricacies of Zach’s tumor on his MRI scans, and the Medical Oncologist drew out an entire plan with us while we were sitting there. He also taught us about the molecular variations in brain tumors and described why those were important to understand. It was the first time since Zach’s initial MRI that we felt some positivity again. It was also the first time we left an appointment and could smile. We immediately felt that Penn was the best place for Zach’s surgery and adjuvant treatments.Why three brain surgeries?The first resection surgery was a success (90-95% of tumor removed), but the initial thought was his tumor was grade II at the time. Everything at that point was textbook grade II. It wasn’t until the post-op pathology of the larger sample that doctors discovered it was more of an intermediate grade II/grade III, which can be more aggressive. So, the surgeon recommended going back in to get more of the remaining tumor out, which would cause Zach to essentially lose the peripheral vision in his left eye. Zach wishes he could have raised his hand during the first surgery and told the surgeon to remove more the first time, but obviously that wasn’t an option. The second resection surgery was also a success and 95-99% of the tumor was removed. There is still a small amount of tumor in his brain because it was dangerously located near a critical blood vessel and was inoperable.What about work?Zach’s company was acquired early in 2017 and he was told he would be laid off by the new company later that summer. He was offered a new position at another company (during Hurricane Irma) and accepted. However, FMLA cannot be used unless you have worked for an organization for at least 12-months. He has had some short-term benefit payments, but those have been exhausted. My employer has been amazing to work with, and I have been able to keep up with my job, thankfully. I have a wonderful manager and team and they have been so supportive and caring. I am very lucky! I cannot use FMLA either because I used most of my available time for maternity leave. Lesson learned - try your best not have multiple family medical issues in the same 12-month time frame! Zach cannot drive because of the seizures, so I must drive him everywhere, including to work and doctors' appointments. I often have to miss meetings and events at work to do so.  Many of you know how much Zach loves driving and cars - they were his passion. This has been extremely difficult for him. My dad has also been living with us in FL since he started a new job in Fort Myers in September. My mom, aunt, and brother have been a great support system and babysitters for Roxanne during our time in NJ/PA. We have Roxanne in a wonderful child care facility while I am working. It is expensive, but it has allowed her to have some routine and consistency in her life, for which we are grateful. The caregivers have become a second family for her.Detailed Diagnosis (Pathology) - Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Grade III GliomaZach was initially diagnosed with a low-grade glioma (WHO grade II). After his first tumor resection surgery, pathology indicated there were pockets of anaplasia, which means some cells were actively dividing and the tumor was more of an intermediate grade II/III. This means we need to be very aggressive in his treatment plan because tumors can recur and grow into higher grades. Zach does have several molecular markers that make his tumor more treatable than others. We’re told his tumor has 2 out of the 3 that respond well to chemo and radiation treatment, but we cannot delay.Recommended TreatmentTumor resection surgeryTemodar (chemotherapy pill) - during radiation and 12-months following radiationProton Radiation - 6-weeks at Penn Medicine in PhiladelphiaCost: $125554.11 ($62777.05 due prior to treatment; five-month installments of $12555.41)TimelineSpring/Summer 2017 - absent seizures observed by MelAugust 9, 2017 - Meet with GP to Discuss Episodes (first doctor appointment with a GP ever while I was married to Zach)August 14, 2017 - MRI in the morning, Called into office in the afternoon.

It meant Poppy would not run into major complications for a few days and we could figure out how to get her to the states. That put a lot of pressure on us. We lived in LA and that was where Poppy and my wife had insurance coverage. It made the most sense to us to try to fly her there for care. Maggie spent many hours on calls with her insurance company doing her best to stress the nature of the situation. They bounced her around from extension to extension and made things extra impossible for us to ensure an air evacuation. They tried to send us a regular airplane without physicians and our doctor caught that when she called them to make sure they were sending the correct plane. The insurance contracted a Mexican plane with the right equipment and personnel that we felt confident could do the job. Our prayers had been answered and Poppy could be in LA in a day and a half. We breathed a little easier and felt relieved that was happening. The company called us two hours before departure and informed us there was a landing gear malfunction and they couldn’t come. Insurance had failed us multiple times. Me,my wife her aunts and father were in the room when that news came in and you could feel the hope just leave out all at once. We all panicked. My wife cried and we just felt we were out of options. The doctor came in and handed my wife a list of people with planes and helicopters that served the west coast and when my wife called a few they responded. “Lady I can’t fly emergency missions to Mexico” It was then that I entered the small little bathroom in the hospital room that i dropped to my knees and with tears in my eyes and cried out. “God show me your will for this baby. Show us where you want us to go” I promise you not thirty seconds after i walked outta that bathroom the doctor asked to speak with me in the hallway where she said. “I know a doctor in Miami.” I stopped her right there and immediately said “go now and please call them” i knew from the moment i heard Miami that that was where gods will was. I walked back into the room with my family and announced “Poppy is going to Miami” My wife responded with “Miami? How will we do that? She’s not covered there and it’s so far from our home.” I said i don’t know but that’s what we’re going to do. So here we are today in Miami.

My name is Rose, and my family and I are asking you to please help save my brother John's life. John is 35 years old and is currently battling an aggressive, life-threatening brain tumor called a glioblastoma (GBM). The average prognosis for a GBM patient is 12-15 months. There is no standard treatment for recurrent brain cancer and this presents both a financial and medical challenge. John’s current treatment plan includes Avastin and Keytruda infusions, but these treatments are not curative, so we have been tirelessly searching for more options. Through outreach to many doctors and foundations, John has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help John in his battle with brain cancer!In 2012, John was a typical 29 year-old living in Chicago, building a successful career, and engaged to the love of his life, Allyson. One day at work, John was in a meeting and very abruptly started seizing and was rushed to the emergency room. Everything changed for John and our family that day. John was diagnosed with an anaplastic astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer. He underwent an awake craniotomy which removed 60-70% of the brain tumor. Immediately after surgery, John started radiation, chemo, and adopted lifestyle changes which doctors and researchers thought would be helpful.(Here is John after his first surgery with his neurosurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa (Dr.Q),  in 2012)From 2013 to 2017, the conventional treatments helped stabilize John’s tumor and John and Allyson started a family by welcoming first Dennis (now almost 4 years old) and then Matthew (now 1 year old). John continued to work, but also committed himself to encouraging others fighting for their lives through the Livestrong Foundation. He has spoken at and participated in numerous Livestrong events to help inspire others, all while continuing his own fight. (John, Allyson, Dennis (3), Matthew (1))Last May (’17), just a few weeks after Matthew was born, John went in for a routine MRI that produced devastating news; the tumor suddenly showed significant growth. This time the tumor was so aggressive that he started losing some of his vision and speech. In January (’18), John underwent his second awake craniotomy which was more invasive and painful than the first. The initial news was promising as Dr.Q and his team were able to get almost 90% of the tumor.(John in the ER on Christmas Eve 2017- always smiling!)However, the pathology results came back with the worst news to date- John’s recurrence was now a GBM. A month post-surgery the tumor had grown back to its original size, and a new tumor was found shortly after.  Despite all of this, John continues to be the most positive, empathetic and loving person you will ever meet. I think anyone who knows him agrees that he has a smile that is uplifting and a demeanor that can change the entire tone in a room. John is a fighter and he is determined not to lose this battle!

(Watch this video of John featured on the news as he was biking across Iowa at Ragbrai 2015. He talks about overcoming obstacles and staying positive!)This is where we need your help. John has serious vision and speech impairments which have ended his ability to work. Through outreach to many doctors and the foundations working to cure brain cancer, John has been offered a promising opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment is not covered by insurance. The cost for this treatment is substantial, around $100,000, and the need to start is urgent! To date, John and Allyson have paid for all medical costs in excess of insurance, but this is more than our family can handle. Please know that we would not ask for this help if we did not feel it was completely necessary. By donating to this cause, you are helping my brother get the treatment he needs to keep fighting! Additionally, your donations will enable doctors to pursue these leading edge treatments in research that potentially could save others from this horrible disease. Any funds raised that do not go towards treatment will be put towards providing John’s young boys a secure future.Thank you in advance for all your love and support!(Family with Santa!

We would be profoundly grateful for any contribution and for the diffusion of this heartfelt appeal among friends and people sensitive to this struggle.Many thanks.En algún momento de nuestras vidas, todos hemos sido afectados por el cáncer, ya sea personalmente o ayudando a un ser querido a combatirlo.

El costo es enorme pues afecta física, financiera y emocionalmente al enfermo  y a sus seres queridos.Mi hermano, Alejandro Fernandez de Cossio, fue disgnosticado con cáncer de pulmón a finales de 2014, con un pronostico de 6 meses de vida. El ha sido y sigue siendo un luchador incansable contra la enfermedad y ha superado con éxito una serie de tratamientos y, todavía, se resiste a darse por vencido. El oncólogo de Ale ha realizado la solicitud (rechazada) y tres apelaciones para lograr el tratamiento con Alecensa (Alectinib), continuacion del Crizotinib, que se le aplico cuando todo parecia perdido en marzo de 2017, re expandiendole el pulmon colapsado y disminuyendo considerablemente la masa tumoral en el mediastino. Lamentablemente el burocratismo y, lo que es peor, la negación a curar a un enfermo por el elevadisimo precio de la medicina que necesita, hacen imposible que Ale pueda acceder a la misma: el seguro no la cubre.El costo del Alecensa en USA es de $15,158 dólares por 240 capsulas (2 meses de tratamiento).  https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/alecensaCubrir un año de tratamiento ascendería a alrededor de $90,948, cifra imposible de costear por la familia.  Hemos recurrido a  organizaciones, fundaciones, farmacias, etc. pero, hasta ahora, no hemos obtenido resultados. Es por esto que divulgo esta situación pues yo, y los muchos amigos que conocen y quieren a Alejandro, nos resistimos a aceptar ser vencidos y queremos agotar todas las posibilidades.Estaremos profundamente agradecidos con cualquier colaboración y con la difusión de esta apelación entre amigos y personas sensibles a esta batalla contra uno de los flagelos  de la humanidad que continua sufriendo nuestro querido Alejandro.",343,1.3k,7,354,23 days,16 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Many a story can be told of Fritz selflessly giving to others. Whether building houses for the impoverished in Mexico or helping friends through their own personal cancer battles! Recently Fritz was re-diagnosed with Lymphoma. If I have the story correct, he was a survivor 12 years ago and given a Cancer Free diagnosis. Sadly, “C” has returned and it looks like the treatment is going to be more challenging than the first time.Fritz will undergo 3 rounds of potent chemo and for all 3 rounds be admitted to the hospital for 4 days when the medicine is being administered. Following the 3rd treatment, Fritz’s bone marrow will be harvested and frozen. He will then be admitted to the hospital for 5-6 weeks to have the “nuclear chemo” administered in hopes of killing all traces of the “C” and then his bone marrow will be placed back in his body to help produce health cells and help him recover. Following the 5-6 weeks in the hospital, he will be confined at home for an additional 5-6 weeks with a care giver. Fritz’s daughter is leaving her job for this period of time to be her dad’s caregiver.We are raising funds for 3 primary reason. 1. In essence, Fritz will be out of work for 4-6 months. The last thing we want Fritz worrying about is the financial toll this will have on him. We want him to focus on beating “C”s ass! And being healthy.2. While Fritz has health insurance, there is a 7K out of pocket deductible and many of the medicines that Fritz will be prescribed are not covered by the insurance. 3. Any remaining funds will used to help with the loss of income Fritz”s daughter will incur while taking FMLA to care for her dad.Fritz’s first chemo treated started Friday, April 6th.We want to thank all who contribute to this fund raising effort in advance.Chuck and Julia Brown",87,92,12,87,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Thank you to each & every one of you who has contributed to Howard’s medical care! We are beyond grateful! Howard has seen the donations, but has been too weak to acknowledge them personally. Three weeks out, he is at home recuperating. It has been a much slower recovery than his other two colon resections, but then again, this surgery was far more extensive and intensive. So far, he is mostly sleeping ...has a few bites to eat or moves to the couch and sleeps again. He has lost 30 pounds, but not his fighting spirit. His Drs said this is par for the course and he is doing great! Many patients take 2-3 months before their appetite and energy return. In the meantime, we are sustained by the compassion of our friends and family and our love for one another. Please continue to keep Howard in your thoughts and prayers!

3/21/2018 Here is an article written by Linda Yang for Colon Cancer Coalition about Howard. Please continue to spread the word and contribute to this campaign. (Link to full article:  https://coloncancercoalition.org/2018/03/15/faces-of-blue-howard-brown/)

I was born in St. Louis in 1966, five minutes later than my twin sister, Cheryl. I grew up in the Boston suburbs of Framingham, Massachusetts, being very active in all sports, but excelled most at basketball. I graduated in 1988 from Babson College in Wellesley, MA, which is the number one college for entrepreneurism in the world. I had a career in high technology – software, Internet, and cloud computing.

I’ve been married to my wife, Lisa Brown, for over 23 years and we have a daughter, Emily, who is a junior in high school. Lisa is my current caretaker, but being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer has put tremendous stress on the family and me. I am currently on disability and not working because the chemotherapy has been kicking my ass. My wife had neck surgery a few years ago and currently is not working as well. We’re trying to keep things as normal as we can for our daughter, who is an amazing student and a soccer goalie.

My story with cancer started when I was 24-years-old. I was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. I failed three different chemo recipes, but my twin sister, Cheryl, was an exact HLA (human leukocyte antigen) match. I had a bone marrow transplant from Cheryl that saved my life at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA on May 24, 1990.

I had blasting chemo and twice daily full body irradiation prior to my bone marrow transplant. I achieved remission, or NED (no evidence of disease) for 28 years until I went for my recommended colonoscopy at age 50. I learned that I had stage III colon cancer and immediately had a colon recession surgery where 13 inches were removed. I started and completed 12 grueling rounds of FOLFOX from August to February. A CT scan revealed that the colon cancer had spread just outside my colon. I had a second colon recession surgery in March 2017, removing 10 more inches, and started immunotherapy stage I clinical trial.

In July of 2017, a CT scan showed metastases to the liver, peritoneal lining, bladder, and outside of the colon. I was now diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. I started a new recipe of Irinotecan/ Avastin for 10 cycles, which have shown some “interval improvement,” what is also known as shrinkage. I was recently approved for CRS-HIPEC (cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) surgery scheduled for mid-March. I plan on “getting to NED.” I have a daughter that I want to see graduate high school, play college soccer, and walk her down the aisle; get my life back.

I’ve spent my life as an active volunteer in my community. I was the president of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), and am board members of the Jewish Federation, the AJC, and the Hebrew Free Loan. I have raised millions for Jewish communities and people in need. I am a trustee for Babson College, and the board’s president for the Babson Alumni Association.

When I think of “Get Your Rear in Gear,” it means a “call to action.” The call is to recruit participants, volunteers, and fundraisers to support Colon Cancer Coalition in its mission to support colon cancer education, early testing, research, patients, caregivers, and families. This is my second go around with major life threatening chemo. I have a huge worldwide movement and following on Facebook that is called “HBStrong!” I have so many people that love me, pray for me, and follow my journey. Of course I try to keep it as positive as possible. My words of wisdom: cancer sucks, but the beast must be slayed, and that is all I can do each day. Keep the faith.

3/13/2018 Please join us in supporting Howard Brown and his family in their time of need. We are part of the HBstrong Network of college and high school friends that want to support the family during this critical time.
Howard has been battling Stage 4 Colon Cancer (22 cycles of chemo, 2 major colon reconstruction surgeries, immunotherapy).  He faces major life saving surgery on March 13th called CRS HIPEC - see video link

We are launching phase 1 of this contribution campaign to raise $50,000 to help Howard and his family pay for medical bills and other expenses not covered by insurance. Please join us by making a contribution of any size and sharing with others.

Medical,8,"For Our Warrior, Jeff",https://www.gofundme.com/for-our-warrior-jeff,"MORRISTOWN, NJ","August 1, 2018","$85,000","$82,885","To our Family, Friends, and Friends of Friends who have followed Jeff's story....As many of you already know,  life changed for our family in April of 2016.  My brother Jeff Leloia was diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 33.   Before we dive into Jeff's story, I want to first tell all of you about Jeff and for one second, forget about this terrible disease that has changed our lives and his life forever.   My sister and Jeff's story is a true fairytale.  Two teenage kids (18 years old) meeting at the very beginning of college- Quinnipiac University.   Since the day they met, the two of them have been inseparable.    They are the two nicest people you could ever meet.   They never asked for anything out of life besides being happy together and wanting to start a family.    Its a love like no other and one that I look up too everyday.  They have been together since 2001 and married in 2009.   As so many of you know,  I met my husband at Jeff and Alyson's wedding.  Tommy was Jeff's groomsmen and I was the MOH.  From there, it was history.  Tommy and I owe much of our lives to the two of them....   Jeff and Tommy were best friends and now brother in laws. It couldn't have worked out better!     Jeff and Al went onto have 2 children since 2009. Vanessa is 6 years old and the happiest little girl.  Nicholas is 3 and loves trains and giggles at every little thing.    Life as we knew it, was as perfect as it could be.   In April of 2016, everything changed for us when Jeff had a seizure.  I will never forget that day as long as I live. I had just hung up the phone with my sister and within seconds, it happened. Alyson had called back in a panic and I assured her it was probably nothing to worry about.  Boy, do I wish I was right.  Unfortunately after many tests, we discovered a brain tumor was pushing on his motor area (which caused the seizure).  In September of 2016, they removed a Grade 3 brain tumor at Columbia Pres in NYC.  He underwent 6 weeks of radiation and chemo cycles for almost 1 year.   Things seemed to be okay....In October 2017 a questionnable ""spot"" showed up on his MRI and this ""spot"" had been growing on each subsequent MRI, raising concern for a recurrence.  We were told regular standard of care was not going to work (regular chemo) so they opted to find a clinical trial that would hopefully help.  On Jan 22 of 2018, Jeff entered into a Phase 1B clinical trial out of Columbia Pres. in NYC.   Jeff was in the hospital for over 50 days during this trial.  Since he was the first person to enter this specific trial for a long period of time, side effects were not known (but of course, we knew there was a risk).     The trial left Jeff with weakened mobility on one side of his body.   He went to Kessler after the trial to work on getting his strength back.  While the strength on his one side did not come back fully, Jeff's positive attitude remained.  We continued to live life as best we could knowing he would be monitored every 4 weeks with MRI scans.  He came home from Kessler in March of 2018.    As you can imagine, being away from home for almost 2 months was beyond difficult but our warrior never complained.  In May of 2018, his MRI scan came back showing something....doctors were unsure what this was and hoped it was an effect from the trial he had done.  We continued to monitor it.   We planned our family vacation to Lake George in June.  The day before we left for vacation we received news that the latest MRI was still showing this ""effect"" and the doctors believed it was cancer again.     As you can imagine, it was a devastating blow to find out the day before we were supposed to leave....But despite this, we went on our vacation and had the best time.   But are you surprised? That is who Jeff is....Despite overwhelming circumstances in his life, Jeff has never gave in.    I am so proud to be his sister.After our few days away, we knew we would come home and have another battle to fight.    The doctors had suggested they biopsy this new area to determine how best to treat it.   We were told it would be an in and out situation (an overnight) but unfortunately it was not. Jeff went in for this biopsy on July 11 (Alyson's birthday) however his speech and now the ""good side"" of his body was weakened.   This was due to the biopsy.    Again- pure devastation.   While we knew the cancer would eventually impact his movement and speech (due to where the cancer is in his brain..by the motor strips), we were not prepared for this to happen so suddenly nor for it to be because of the biopsy we were assured would have no risk.   This has been one of the hardest parts as a family to watch.     Once this happened, the doctors were unsure if something had happened during the biopsy (stroke, etc) so they took another MRI.   It was not a stroke, etc so the immobility and speech issues were due to the biopsy they did however the MRI showed something we were also not prepared for.     This day was the worst day of all our lives since April of 2016.On July 13th, we were told that the MRI showed the cancer had spread to the other side of his brain.    Not only were we left to deal with this horrible news but we also now had to deal with the immobility on his ""good side"" due to the biopsy they had done.    Jeff had to go back to Kessler Rehab for a few days but we were anxious to get him home immediately because we know time is now precious.     He is now home and we are making him as comfortable as we can given the situation at hand.While the doctors can't give us timing -- and clearly they are very unsure of many things when it comes to this awful disease, we were told if wanted, Jeff could opt for radiation with a mix of immunotherapy.   Jeff was now considered in Stage 4 and the cancer showing up on the MRI was most likely a glioblastoma.   The prognosis of a glioblastoma is not great but we will continue to fight and NEVER give up hope that a miracle may come our way!!!   Our warrior will not give up despite his physical complications either!!     We had a chair lift put into the house to help bring Jeff from downstairs to upstairs and a ramp has been put in on the outside of the house to make it wheelchair accessible when he has to go to radiation (He goes back and forth to the city for radiation through all of this).  Our family has not asked for help up until this point.   While Jeff's story has been out there, we have shielded everyone from all the details- the hard stuff.      While none of us know what tomorrow will bring, this is what we do know.Jeff is now unable to work as his position has been released at this point (he has not been able to work since the clinical trial started in January).  My sister has had to stop working as a Physical Therapist and is now acting as his full time caregiver.     As you can imagine, this has been extremely difficult for her and words will never be able to explain what she is going through.     Due to the fact that she can't work and his position has been released (he carried the benefits), the insurance is no longer covered.   They are offered COBRA to pay on their own for the time being.   Insurance only covers 1 hour of home health care for 12 visits and unfortunately, Jeff now needs more.    My parents, Jeff's parents, and my husband have also been acting as caregivers and helping with the kids but we need more help- everyone has done a tremendous amount so far.  Family and friends have done so much already too and we thank every single one of you but at this time, we are hoping to raise some money for Jeff, Alyson and the kids to help pay for the full time aide we will need (approx. 250 a day), help cover some insurance costs (approx. 1600 a month), installing whatever other equipment is necessary, etc.        Any donation would be MUCH appreciated.  Every single dollar of it will go to help Jeff and the family during this horrible time and anything that is left, will go directly to Alyson to help with the children and home.    Please consider donating to the Leloia family.    It saddens me that this is something we even have to be writing...I have always been the one on the ""other side"" of these pages.   My brother is my HERO.  He is this entire family's hero.  And we will never give up hope.  We will continue to fight this terrible disease until we can't anymore.  We will never stop trying to find a cure so this doesn't happen to any other family.   At 35 years old, no man should ever go through what Jeff is going through and has gone through.  Take a minute today to hug your loved ones and tell them you love them.  In a split second, life for us changed and the scary truth is, it could happen to any of us.  This disease isn't hereditary- it just happens.    Vanessa and Nicholas's lives will never be the same because of it and my sister is watching her best friend and husband fight for his life.     It is unimaginable and absolutely unnatural that this is happening to their young family....We love you Jeff.  Not a day will EVER go by where we don't fight for you and your family and for others who are battling this same disease. Good Vibes Only to our WarriorPam",737,1.9k,31,735,1 month,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Pineal gland tumors account for less than 1% of all brain tumors and as a result, determining the appropriate course of action can be both tricky and expensive. The fear and shock from this diagnosis has been overwhelming for Charles, his Mom (Wendy), his younger brother (George) and his older sister (Katherine). Charles now has an incredible team of Doctors at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and is headed there to begin a six month course of chemo treatments next week.If one had to choose the best expression to describe Charles it is that he is a ""Can Do Guy"". Charles has demonstrated this time and time again: on the lacrosse fields at Lake Forest High School, carrying a full course load at De Pauw University, graduating and gaining a spot with IBM consulting and being the chief Cook in the Cook household! When his Dad passed away 12 years ago, Charles stepped up to the plate at 11 years old and became a stronghold for the family. Just before this diagnosis, Charles commented that he was in the best shape of his life: physically, mentally and emotionally. Charles remains determined, focused and deliberate in his dedication to defeating this tumor. In fact, he has said several times that he actually believes that he will be a better person for having gone through this experience. Charles' strength is not a fluke. His Mom, Wendy, is an incredibly strong woman who has dedicated herself to her three children ever since their Dad's sudden death 12 years ago. Like Charles, she would give you the shirt off her back and is incapable of saying no to any request. She is one of the most selfless people I know. Charles' diagnosis has shattered even Wendy's perpetually sunny disposition. It is clear that she is overwhelmed and frightened. If the dictum: You have to be a friend to have a friend has any basis of truth, then Wendy and Charles Cook could jointly run for Mayor of the World! I know that many of his, her, mine, our friends will hear about Charles diagnosis and want to help out. There are numerous uncovered costs that will arise and any donations to help defray those expenses would be incredible and very welcome. Additionally, prayers, positive thoughts and warm wishes are truly appreciated.I will keep all of you updated as Charles conquers this challenge.XOXOTEAM CHARLES",684,1.0k,2,678,3 months,28 days ago,3 months,2018-09-03
Medical,8,Wiley Corra,https://www.gofundme.com/5c6oabc,"DURANGO, CO","March 30, 2018","$85,000","$81,278","Our beautiful boy Wiley is fighting hard for his life and health after a fall and traumatic brain injury which occurred in the most benign of settings. On March 24th, 2018, after a great day of  skiing with friends in Utah,  we went out for a movie. Killing time, waiting for the show to start, we were outside on a pedestrian bridge. There was a low wall on the opposite side that, deceptively, looked to have grass immediately behind. In fact, there was a gap between the grass and bridge that dropped 25 feet to a service road below. Excited and energetic, Wiley lept onto the wall, looking back at us, and dropped to the other side expecting a short and soft landing on grass, as we expected too. Hearing a delayed hit from below, we knew this wasn’t the case.  

Frantically, I searched for a way down. When I got to my  boy I was sure he was lost to us. I now know that grief. Within five minutes the ambulance was there; ten more and he was at Intermountain Hospital, Level I Trauma Center in Murray, UT.  Dr Peter Maughan performed a decompressive craniectomy (removal of a section of skull to allow the brain to swell). There is significant damage to his left brain. Other various fractures and breaks are not of concern, his spine is okay, and bruised lungs will heal. He is fighting hard. 

Wiley has always been a determined young man. He is an excellent, Freshman Honor Roll Student at Durango High School. He is sweet, loving and caring toward his friends, family, and teammates, never in serious trouble, focused and attentive (when we pry his nose out of video devices). He has a long and arduous road ahead toward recovery. While he is as well prepared for this journey as anyone could be, the outcome is uncertain.  The care at IMH is outstanding. Given the circumstances we couldn’t be in a better place. 

We so appreciate your taking an interest in Wiley’s recovery. The love and support that has been flowing from our home community, Durango (and well beyond) is staggering.  As hard as this is-and it is the hardest thing we have ever endured- it would be unimaginable without your love, prayers, and positive thoughts for Wiley’s recovery. You are helping  us become the warriors needed to fight alongside our precious boy. Thank you.",639,1.4k,11,646,5 months,3 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Those of you who know Sofia know how much she loves her family and her friends. One of her favorite things to do is spend time with her cousins. She also loves singing, acting and cheerleading. Sofia is currently in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. She suffered a severe head trauma and is still in critical condition. Sofia has a long recovery ahead of her, but she is resilient and a fighter. My parents have not left her side and will need to continue to be by her side as we face the long and challenging road that lies ahead of her. I want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out, kept Sofia and our family in their prayers and sent food. Many of you have asked what else you can do to help. As my parents will need to continue to be by her side any donations for my family are greatly appreciated and will help with expenses. We know Sofia is a strong girl and will find the power within to fight her way through this. Please continue to pray for my sister and our family, and for all the other families impacted by this senseless event. Thank you.",1.0k,5.9k,5,970,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Complications of her diabetes left her without enough oxygen for a number of hours which in turn caused significant trauma to her brain. While the prognosis is not good, we all believe that there is room for hope and that the Jackie we know, the one that has been battling diabetes for years while managing to make a wonderful life and career for herself, will continue to fight. The Habeebs are extremely grateful to all that have gone to visit, reached out, offered help, and prayed for Jackie. With that said, I would ask that we offer our financial assistance as well. As of today, the plan is to bring  Jackie up from Charleston back home to Boston where she will have the best care and be close to friends and family. The process of moving her via med flight is not covered by insurance and is in excess of $13,000 and while insurance will cover a lot of the actual costs associated with the medical care, there is still a significant portion that the Habeebs themselves will incur. There isn’t a person that has met the Habeebs that hasn’t been touched by their selfless generosity. There is always a chair at the table for another guest, another bed for those in need, and a happy home for a wondering soul. When my sister in law was pregnant, they hosted her baby shower. When my brother passed away, they held the celebration of his life there. And when my wedding came to an end, it was the Habbebs that invited all guests for a nightcap. While I may have benefited more than most, I’m sure each of you has a fond memory of a holiday spent in their kitchen, a Patriots game in their family room,  or a sweltering summer's day spent in their pool. As the Habeebs often say, we are all cousins. It’s time we come together and support the family that made all of us family. This is going to be an uphill battle but with your support and prayers I have no doubt that Jackie can do it. Please contribute what you can.-Please note that this fund has been approved by the Habeeb family and is much appreciated",641,2.0k,64,643,1 month,28 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Medical,9,Assist Sally Newman,https://www.gofundme.com/assist-sally-newman,"BROOKLYN, NY","April 19, 2018","$100,000","$77,285","Hi Friends, We are raising money to help our friend Sally Newman, who is fighting osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.  Sally was one of the maids of honor at our wedding and a friend for more than 10 years.  She is an amazing person and friend, and she brings light into the lives of everyone she meets. Sally is also an amazing lawyer and advocate, who has done so much for so many people. Sally graduated from NYU law in 2009 and she is the founder of  Charleston Legal Access, a nonprofit sliding-scale law firm meant to help people gain access to legal services.  It is a wonderful endeavor, but obviously not a very profitable one. Beyond her illness, Sally and her husband Romain are facing high medical costs and she is unable to work. We want to help her to have more comfort during this fight.  Please help support Sally during this challenging time in her life.  Thank you, Kimberly Ong & Ian Marcus AmelkinPS--Here is an amazing letter that Sally recently posted on her prognosis and how she is handling it: Off Course — An Update on How Cancer Hijacked my 2018 Dear everyone — this is dedicated to everyone who I’ve been unresponsive to in the past few months, or not responsive enough. When I was going through the diagnosis process and the research and treatment consultations, I was too overwhelmed to communicate much; now, in chemotherapy, I’m so fatigued that I feel further away than ever from catching up. Please know that if I haven’t responded it’s not for lack of loving you with all my heart. Even if we haven’t talked much lately.This is also dedicated to everyone who I don’t know well who might be reading this. I’ve spent hours and hours reading up on cancer and cancer treatment and surgeries and have a new, profound appreciation for everyone who has been willing to share intimate details of their struggles so people like me can find encouragement and hope in their stories. I’ve been quiet on social media the last few months but am making this public because who knows — if I can pay it forward and this is helpful to someone, a shade less privacy is worth it.The bad newsAs you might have heard, for the last year I’ve had a mystery ailment in my left glute. Actually, I first noticed my left side looked a little different from my right side about four years ago, but one year ago, I noticed my left leg seemed longer than my right, and I started getting lower back pain and tightness and swelling in my glute. I started visiting a long list of professionals, including an orthopedic surgeon, who seemed unconcerned, and acupuncturists and massage therapists, who were stumped. Finally, this fall, I found a primary care physician (he thought maybe my right side was atrophied) and insisted he refer me for an MRI, which showed one fist-sized solid mass in my soft tissue, surrounded by an ominous looking network of — something — infiltrating the muscles around the mass. The orthopedic oncologist I was referred to diagnosed it as something called tumoral calcinosis, which is a rare disease associated with mineralization. To make a long story short, he was wrong, and luckily his and his team’s incompetence was evident enough, early enough, that I knew something was off and went for a second opinion less than a month later at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Within two days, they had diagnosed me with osteosarcoma based on complete imaging (the MRI I got in Charleston was “not very good” — burn — according to the Mayo doctors, which is to say that they didn’t bother imaging my whole pelvis and missed the important part that showed it was CANCER). It sucks that I didn’t catch this earlier. On the other hand, let’s all thank the baby Jesus, Buddha, mother Earth and everyone who encouraged me to be pushy and pursue that second opinion (edited to add: to the tune of $17K, which my insurance denied, and denied on appeal, and I put on credit cards. In case anyone has forgotten how truly shitty our healthcare system is).Anyway. This is where I frequently get stuck in imagining breaking this news to people, because there is cancer and then there is cancer, and after a cancer diagnosis, the natural followup question is what the prognosis is. There are cancers where 99% of people survive with the right minor surgery, and there are cancers where…. Well, where a lot of people don’t survive. And the truth is, I have a profoundly shitty kind of cancer. Osteosarcoma (which is extraordinarily rare in adults) is generally acknowledged to be treatable only by chemo (a few months), followed by surgery, followed by chemo (more months to a year or more, depending on how well it works). Oh, and the surgery that was first offered to me is something charmingly called a “hindquarter amputation” — and if that wasn’t bad enough, a few days later the offer was rescinded (by those doctors) because my cancer is too advanced to amputate my hindquarter. Yeah. This was obviously a lot to take in. As for prognosis, earlier in the century, overall survival rates were 20%. Now that chemo exists, it’s more like 60–70%… unless you have metastases at diagnosis, which I do. My rate is more like 20%. Except that right now I’m not eligible for surgery, which puts me, statistically, at a five year survival rate of — well, generously, 10%. Except! Except! As I’ll discuss at some point, I have a badass immune system (this has been scientifically measured), which puts me at… higher? I don’t know. Listen, this cancer is bad. There are treatments. I’m going to do my best to help them work. None of us are guaranteed a certain amount of time on earth. Probably this is the thing that will kill me. But I’m trying to survive. And one thing that the research shows is that having a loving support network helps cancer patients thrive, and I am being absolutely lavished with love and support. Believe it or not, one of the hardest struggles of this process (and therefore of my life) has been feeling worthy of the care I’m receiving. That is true.If you’re feeling down after that prognosis, which, I don’t know, hopefully you are? Let’s pause here to check in with my all time FAVORITE cancer author, Kate Bowler. Buy her book! I might be biased by the fact that it was published right when I desperately needed to hear from a thoughtful, funny, insightful 38 year old woman who also was told recently she had incurable cancer and yet is living a meaningful life and has made sense of things, but it’s very, very good, and every page resonated with me. Her NYTimes article, What to Say When You Meet the Angel of Death at a Party, which first made me aware of her genius, is also excellent, and, get this, one of her podcast episodes features the best Washington Post writer, Alexandra Petri, who she is friends with. A ton of people have asked if there is anything they can do for me, and mostly I ask for smoothies and cat gifs (and occasionally money), but darlings, what I really want is to be friends with Kate Bowler (and Alexandra Petri). If you could hook that up that would be amazing.What it’s like (? Sometimes? For me) getting diagnosed with cancerOne thing about hearing that my life expectancy is somewhere in the months or years instead of decades, and that I’ll spend — some, most or all of that life in chemotherapy, is that all of these everyday objects and concepts feel like they’re whirling off into space, having come unmoored from my expectations and implied plans. Here are a few things that upon crossing my mind have sent me into the depths of despair in the last few months: hairties, a dental checkup, my mortgage, retinol creams, Latisse, Lasix, my disorganized garage, continuing legal education credits, houseplants, my solar panels, kittens, videos of circus performances…It’s like living in a horror movie where I look at my hiking shoes and they’re like “LIFE IS FUTILE, SHORT, AND PAINFUL” and I start sobbing. It’s honestly extremely disorienting. But thankfully, after four months, I’m getting used to the new reality and regaining my sense of humor. The irony of living out what might be my last year or two waiting to get used to the idea of dying is not lost on me, by the way.In general my cancer diagnosis doesn’t seem very personal. My pain is mingled in the pain it has caused and will cause my husband, my father, my sister, and dear friends, family and colleagues, and while everyone suffers in different ways we are in it together, which is both uplifting and crushingly sad. But this constant barrage of cancer reminders feels much more personal, and so that much more isolating and frightening.I’m also embarrassed to say that one of the overwhelming emotions I felt upon diagnosis was… well, embarrassment. Imagine that through no fault of your own, your car was run off the road during rush hour, and you were stuck in a ditch while everyone rubbernecked on their way home from dinner. This is more or less how I felt — humiliated, off course, and certain that I would be on display for everyone’s even more embarrassing sympathy. Except, times a million because it’s not my car, it’s my life. I hate sympathy! I mean, I like love and attention, like everyone, but I hate the idea of being a tragedy being tsked over.Which is why I felt a soft sense of comradery and fellowship when I learned that a Dartmouth classmate of mine, Ali Youssefi, died recently of cancer. Ali and I were in the same freshman orientation hiking group, and became kinda-friends because we were also assigned to the same freshman dorm. I think my husband and Ali’s wife will forgive me for mentioning that I had a huuuuuge crush on Ali. His family is from Iran, and he had lovely brown eyes and a dashing smile. Dimples? I think so. At the time, our political views, which were the only thing that was really important to me, diverged to an extent that shocked me, although I’ve probably mellowed a bit with him, and more recently he’s reposted some Bernie Sanders quotes (and found a career as a developer who brought affordable housing projects to his hometown of Sacramento — so wonderful), so we might have come around in our middle age. Just a few weeks ago, he did a facebook fundraiser for Palestinian children for his birthday, and I donated, and he messaged me to say thank you. Drowning in my own recent diagnosis, I didn’t respond, but I wish I had, or that I’d looked at his profile, and realized he was in the midst of his own illness, about to start another round of chemotherapy for stomach cancer. Diagnosed in July, he was gone eight months later. I’m so sorry for his loss. But a part of me reached out to him and felt less alone. Me too, said a part of me. I’m dying too. We’re friends in this.And now…I’ll add at least one more entry on Medium later to talk about treatment, but the short story is that I’m currently in NYC being treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I’ve made it through two months of a protocol that’s known for being brutal — a three week cycle of high dose cisplatin and doxorubicin — and I’m doing OK. Not to spoil the hopefully good news of future updates, where I’ll talk a little more specifically about what my doctors are doing and what the rest of the protocol might be, but it looks like my cancer is responding to the chemo for now. It also looks like the remainder of 2018 will be spent in treatment, although there’s not a clear course charted, which if you know me of course you know is driving me insane. As Kate Bowler says, it feels like walking toward a cliff and trusting a bridge will be built over it when I get there. But I’m putting one foot in front of the other, and people who love me are holding my hands.",438,415,3,448,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

In January 2017, Michele was diagnosed with Stage IV Adrenal Cancer which has spread to her liver and lungs. She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and has undergone many surgeries. Michele’s cancer is unusual as it is a very rare and aggressive form that many doctors have not seen. However, this cancer can find just about anyone and change the course of their life as it has theirs. She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and has undergone many surgeries. Despite the side effects associate with these treatments, Michele continues doing what she does best, sharing hope and love to humans and canines. She smiles, even when it’s difficult, she lends an ear to those she loves even when she needs to be heard, she works diligently to care for dogs in need. Always putting others first. Michele’s kindness holds no boundries and her love is unconditional.  At this stage in her journey, Michele’s oncologist recommends that she undergo yet another treatment called Cryoablation. This time insurance has denied this treatment and her oncologist believes it could help her tremendously. He has been 100% dedicated to her recovery and she trusts him 1000%. Michele is suiting up for battle once again! While chemotherapy and radiation have been undeniably tough, she has the same positive attitude, strength, and determination to beat this disease, a feat equally as inspiring. Michele needs your help! During this time, friends and family have been sitting on the sidelines, asking what they can do to help. The Magnano’s have appreciated all of the love and support that friends and family have given and weathered the financial responsibilities on their own. Now, there is an opportunity for us to step off of the sidelines and help them help Michele. The time has come when they need it most. All they really needed were your thoughts, prayers and love, until now.  Anyone who knows Michele, Joe and their family of humans and canines, already know that if the roles were reversed, they are always the first ones to lend a helping hand. No situation prevents them from coming to the aide of someone, even during the toughest battle of their lives. Even though they do so unconditionally and without expectation, now is the time that we can help and be a part of Michele’s fight to beat this dreaded disease. Beating this rare disease would be amazing for Michele and to give hope to others who share her battle.  Every little bit will help them to raise the money they need to cover these medical expenses.

The treatment seemed to  be effective in getting her body to reboot with Doctors hoping that her Kidneys and Liver would begin to heal themselves.  After three weeks at Mount Sinai, they released her back home and while she was determined to be home for mothers day, she quickly developed a fever and we immediately had to bring her back to Overlook again.  Unfortunately, due to the seriousness of the condition, this time they had to transfer Maggie to Columbia Presbyterian in NYC where it has been determined she will need a full liver transplant.Like most who have to deal with a crisis, we never imagined being in this position and certainly weren’t prepared financially for what was to come.  We don’t live in a grand house, we don’t take elaborate vacations and we spend most time trying to find a way to make ends-meet to cover basic expenses.  Sadly, this has totally exhausted all of our resources.   Not only are the medical procedures coming with profound expenses that aren’t covered by insurance, but also the sad fact that Maggie has no paid time off due to the fact that she just started a new job at the Westfield Public Schools this year.  In the effort to pay the mounting medical bills, after care for the kids amongst other things, we are getting to a point where we have exhausted all of our reserves and need help financially. While certainly a humbling experience, please help. LoveThe Grabko's",667,1.4k,10,673,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

While serving overseas, Jack suffered a gunshot wound to the head and immediately received medical treatment by the US military.  Jack was stabilized overseas and transported to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) where he started the healing process.  He spent 39 days at WRNMMC before being transferred to Massachusetts to start his recovery.During his military career, Jack took part in every major conflict that the United States has been involved in since the early 90’s. If you know Jack, he kept a private life. If you had the honor to serve with Jack, you know his actions in combat were heroic. Jack and his wife have three beautiful children; his oldest daughter recently graduated from college and his younger daughter is currently a full-time college student. His five-year-old son is very energetic and truly a chip off the “ol’ Souza block”.  Upon arrival at WRNMMC, Team Souza (Jack’s wife and kids) in typical military family fashion established a 24hr (three 8-hour shifts) bedside vigil so he would never be alone in his time of need.  Now that Jack is out of ICU and on the road to recovery, “Team Souza” has incorporated the newest team member, Jack’s five-year-old son, into the fold, and he is enjoying much missed quality time with his dad during recovery. Jack is not only an incredible parent to his three children, but also to the kids of his close friends who have deployed in the past, as many of these children consider him a father figure and refer to him as “Uncle Jack.”Jack is making impressive progress every day and everyone who knows Jack knows he will make a full recovery- it’s just going to take time and lots of effort.Jack’s friends request this GoFundMe site be established to assist Team Souza through this challenging time and to help with future unanticipated costs of recovery.  Thanks so much for your loving support for Jack and his family during his recovery.",246,1.2k,5,237,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,9,Help Robin Recover,https://www.gofundme.com/help-robin-recover,"ORADELL, NJ","April 1, 2018","$50,000","$73,156","#HelpRobinRecover Hi my name is Scott Salem and the purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for my wife Robin, and mother of Matthew, to help her continuing battle against multiple cancers.BackstoryIn early 2013 Robin found a lump under her arm and after a few tests was diagnosed with two types of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. A course of chemotherapy called R-CHOP was prescribed and treatment began. The treatment consisted of one 6-hour infusion every three weeks for a total of 18 weeks. Halfway through the chemo a routine scan was performed to determine the status of the Lymphoma. The scan showed that the Lymphoma was in remission, but it was also discovered that she had Colon cancer as well.The Next Step In the summer of 2013 it was determined that Robin required surgery to remove the tumor in her colon and had to pause the chemotherapy for the surgery. The surgeon had to remove her cecum, appendix, and 16 inches of her bowel and she came through it with flying colors. The doctors told us that the cancer was fully removed and to resume the chemotherapy, but in her weakened condition Robin developed an infection to the surgery site and had to undergo wound therapy. Finally, late in the year she was able to complete the Lymphoma treatment with relatively mild side effects such as weakness and hair loss.RemissionIn early 2014 we got great news, the follow-up tests showed the Lymphoma in remission and no signs of the colon cancer and Robin was put on a maintenance chemo drug called Rituxan to help keep the Lymphoma in remission. The oncologist determined that no other treatment for the colon cancer was required, the rest of the year went well as she got stronger and was able to be taken off all treatment.Our Worst NightmareIn the beginning of 2015 after routine follow-up tests it was found that the colon cancer had returned. Wow, hearing that news was like being hit by a Mack truck. Robin was determined to beat it so after another surgery to remove a few more inches of her colon, another course of chemo was recommended. This was named FULFOX which consisted of 12 infusions, one every other week, and each time she was sent home with a pump to continue medication for 48 hours longer. Unlike the previous chemo the side effects this time were brutal. Robin was hospitalized a few times and had to pause the treatment to regain some strength. Finally, near the end of 2015 she resumed the treatment.The Battle Had Just BegunThen out of nowhere she started losing her balance, kept falling, and her arms and legs got numb. The oncologist described it as temporary neuropathy caused by the chemotherapy. We were shocked because we had no idea that this was a possible side effect. Robin went on and finished her treatment but her temporary neuropathy turned out to be permanent. She has been mostly bed ridden for the past 2 years. The Fight ContinuesRobin is a fighter, and has vowed to keep going, at the end of last year the cancers remained in remission, then very recently it was discovered that her Lymphoma has returned, we are still deciding on the course of treatment because Robin will never give up. Please Help Robin RecoverWhile our insurance covered most of the expenses we had to hire private nurse/aide to care for her while I was at work, which is not covered. We have drained our savings and have gone into considerable debt to cover the related expenses that are not covered. In addition to the private care that is required there are other non-covered expenses, such as certain medical equipment and modifying our home to make it handicapped friendly. The last 5 years have taken a toll both physically and mentally on the whole family. We ask you to please donate whatever you can, $1, $5, $10, any amount will help Robin continue her fight against this devastating disease. We will keep you updated on her condition and I know with your generosity she will be a cancer survivor.

The doctor perscribed him antibiotics thinking it was pneumonia.  Once he finished the treatment he still did not feel well and went back to the doctor.  In early December,  the doctor ordered a CAT scan which came back abnormal.  A week later Eric and his wife Jessica flew down to Seattle to see an oncologist at Sweedish medical center. The first day Eric had fluid drainned that had been building up around his right lung.  The following day he had a PET scan and a MRI  to help doctors better understand what might be going on.  On December 12, 2017  Eric and Jessica were given a heartbreaking diagnosis.  Eric had stage 4 non small cell lung cancer.   He is not a smoker, nor has he ever been.    At that time the doctor went over his treatment plan:  4-6 rounds of chemotherapy.  He will be having his 4th treatment tomorrow, March 8th.  As you can imagine there have been many expenses-  not all covered by insurance. There have been good days and bad days, multiple trips to Seattle, a stay at the hospital here in Sitka, medical supplies, missed work, costs for hotels, and more to come.  The bills are not far behind. If we could all come together as friends, family and community to  help lift a piece of this burden off of their shoulders, then there will be a sliver of sunshine in their darkest hour. Prayers are answered.  Please pray for Eric and his family.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.",116,534,0,118,5 months,26 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,10,Help fund  treatment for Jawad,https://www.gofundme.com/help-fund-treatment-for-jawad,"IRVING, TX","July 7, 2018","$50,000","$70,141","My name is Summar Hussein and I, with a heavy heart am creating this page in hopes of helping my sweet 6 year old nephew Jawad. Jawad is a bright, energetic, witty and  intelligent boy. He’s the light of our family and is loved by everyone he meets. You can always find him either reading or playing sports, and he is a die hard Boston Red Sox fan! Jawad loves spending time at the library and playing with his 3 older siblings. Since the day he was born, one of Jawad’s most admired physical traits were his eyes. Everyone who knows him will attest to this. Ironically enough, he is being tested with that same vital organ. About 2 months ago, my sister Nancy Hussein noticed that he was not making proper eye contact, he wasn't focusing properly.  She scheduled him for an eye exam but appointments were so far out. As the days passed he was no longer interested in going to the library to read, or picking up a book before bed to read with his mom. He mentioned a few times that everything was black.  His overall activity decreased. He was never one to miss a chance of being outdoors but he was showing more and more disinterest in everything he loved doing. The day of his eye exam finally came and he went in with high spirits and good hopes. Immediately upon exam, his right eye had no activity. It was not responding to light or movement. He was completely blind in his right eye.  Further examination by ultrasound showed white spots covering his retina. This was enough to have him scheduled for an emergent sedated MRI. Before being put to sleep for his exam, he told his mom that he was excited because this would be the best nap ever! And that when he wakes up he can’t wait to give her a big hug. On July 3, 2018 Jawad was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.  This is a rare form of cancer that affects young children. About 300 children in America are diagnosed with Retinoblastoma each year.  It can be caused by a rare genetic or congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene. The MRI showed several seed-like tumors starting around his optic nerve and around his retina. With the location of these tumors being so critical, it is impossible to remove them and restore his vision.  Retinoblastoma has a high curability rate but only after the child loses the affected eye. This is done to remove the cancer with hopes that it does not spread to any other parts of his body. His treatment plan will begin with targeted intra-arterial melphalan chemotherapy. This will be targeted to his right eye and will be done for 3 months. This will be done to reduce the size of the tumors to make his surgery easier. Since this intra -arterial treatment is not offered in Texas where he resides, he will be traveling to Philadelphia to receive the treatment.The next step will be the Enucleation which is the removal of the eye. After that he will be fitted with a prosthetic eye which will need to be changed every so often has he grows. We are hopeful that Jawad can be treated completely and become cancer free as soon as possible. Knowing that, being able to provide him with the best treatment available for him will put an intense amount of financial strain on our family.In Arabic, Jawad means “Generous”. We are kindly asking you to honor his name and open up your hearts to Jawad and donate generously. All funds will go towards treatment that isn’t even partially covered by insurance and to allow his father to take time off work to accompany Jawad to  his appointments and provide the support he needs on this difficult journey. Donations will also be used to help cover travel expenses for the time spent in Philadelphia receiving chemotherapy. Even the smallest amount will make a difference. Most importantly, we ask for your sincere prayers for his fast healing and that God makes this journey light on him and his family.

Everything was fine until he decided to go to hospital one day to get his breathing problem checked. Upon meeting the doctors in Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, he was told that it might have something to do with his kidneys not functioning properly and upon tests, found out that he was suffering from chronic tuburointerstitial nephritis. The differential diagnosis also included sarcoidosis and tuburointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome (TINU) and idiopathic forms of TIN. In simple terms his kidneys failed and they have to be replaced.He has insurance coverage in USA but still had to pay around $10,000 expenses for different payments in the hospital. His current condition is that he needs dialysis for every 2 days till his kidneys are transplanted. He wants to go to India as his family members are willing to donate kidney for him. It will cost $4000 to take him to India along with assistance. Surgery in India would cost him $12900 in Yashoda hospitals, Hyderabad. ICU charges would be $1400 per day. He would need to go through dialysis for 3 months which would cost him around $5000 for 90 days. Apart from all these expenses, Ravi still has the burden of his humongous master’s student loan on him. All of us know how difficult it is for a fresh graduate out of the college to manage such huge expenses.

As a result Bill was paralyzed from the neck down and has lived the last 48 years of his life as a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. Bill took on his disability the same way he played sports, with courage and determination, and has lived these years independently, graduating from, working for, and retiring from UC Berkeley, initially as an early medical retirement, and now, full retirement.However, upon his full retirement in June Bill lost a major source of income, UC sponsored Long Term Disability payments at $900.00 per month. Bill used these funds to help pay for his daily attendant care needs required for a quadriplegic to live independently. The loss of these funds threatens Bill’s ability to live independently in his home. In addition, concurrently with this loss of income, both his needs for, and the cost of, attendant care are rising. Bill anticipated this loss of income a year before it happened and diligently cut back on his expenses at home and researched other ways to replace the income in order to pay for attendant care, through social services and public benefits, but to no avail, as the options were either disqualifying or share of cost prohibitive.As well, recent serious illness, surgery, and hospitalizations have left Bill recovering in bed since January, and the need for attendant care increasing even further than anticipated and his newly reduced income will now barely cover the cost of basic attendant care, if that. In addition to Bill’s normal daily routine of an attendant getting him out of and into his bed into and out of his wheelchair daily, and helping with his morning and evening hygiene and medication regimes, attendant care is needed when he is bedbound to bring him meals, turn him in his bed to prevent pressure sores, help with the same daily hygienic and medication regimes but now including assistance with respiratory therapies and wound care.Bill’s need for financial assistance is immediate and will be ongoing for attendant care and possibly other needs such as adaptive equipment for everyday living that could help mitigate some of the attendant care needs by keeping Bill healthier, back in his wheelchair, able to do more for himself without help, and out of the hospital.Throughout Bill’s life he always thought of others before himself in his school, family, and work lives, whether through his kindness, his volunteer work, or his patient listening to our stories and complaints, and now it is our turn to think of and support Bill.",230,189,2,293,1 month,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are reaching out to our friends, family, well-wishers and looking at crowd funding options to raise money to help with the treatment costsHow it beganIt all started in 2009, when training for a half a marathon, Smitha noticed a sudden onset of fatigue. She went from running 5mi comfortably to needing breaks every half a mile.She also noticed that her flip flops would keep coming off her feet while she was walking.Within a week, she felt an odd tingling sensation in her fingers that spread to her arms.  Followed by cold wet droplets on her face and neck.As these symptoms worsened, she knew something was seriously wrongIn Sept2009, at age of 24, Smitha was diagnosed with MSWhat is MS?MS is an auto-immune disease that affects the central nervous system.Our nerves have a protective sheathing called Myelin. This ensures that electrical impulses can travel through the length of the nervous system. In MS, the patient’s immune system marks this myelin as a threat and starts to attack them. As the myelin gets depleted, the brain can no longer communicate with the rest of the body effectively.The loss of Myelin shows up as black / white scar marks in MRI. MS attacks in waves. And, each attack results in further myelin loss. This directly translates to increased physical disability in the patient.When Smitha was diagnosed with MS, she was still a student. Her Student Health insurance did not cover the treatment costs. She could not afford to pay for her medication, out of pocket.In just 4 months after her diagnosis, hit by a giant relapse. The severity of attack alarming and it affected her quality of life permanently After coming to terms with these new physical limitations, we decided to make the best of what life had to offer. We traveled when we could, added a dog to our family, fostered a few dogs, charted our future, and eventually started thinking about starting our own family. In Jan2016, we were blessed with not just one, but a set of Twin boys!In the 9 years since her diagnosis, Smitha’s condition has constantly been worsening due to multiple relapses. Each relapse has required her to change to the next strongest FDA approved meds in market and none of them have been effective. After another attack in May 2018, we found out that our options for more drugs were quickly running out.We are now at to a point where we need to make some hard choices. If left untreated, the next MS attack could happen any moment. And that can lead to vision loss, memory issues, complete loss of bladder control and even needing a wheelchair permanently.Our kids are only 2.5 years old. And, in these 2.5 years, Smitha has been forced to watch the kids growfrom the sidelines.She was NOT there when the kids took their first steps.She was NOT there when the boys entered the swimming pool for the first time.She has NOT been able to walk with them to the neighborhood parkAnd, she knows, she won’t be able to help them ride a bike,or , play ball with them in the evenings,Or, come running to their aid, when they need her help.After her recent relapse, she has been feeling so exhausted, that she cannot even pick up her kids or even talk coherently when tired.All of this can change though. And the answer is in an extremely promising clinical trial called Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant, or HSCT.HSCT is the first and only medical procedure that can not only stop MS, but also reverse the symptoms of MS, by re-growing the lost myelin. The idea here is to wipe out the faulty immune system in the body with Chemotherapy, then reintroduce the patient’s stem cells and build a new immune system from scratch. This hard reboot of the immune system is a rigorous procedure that takes about a month and a half to complete. It is a risky procedure and is only administered to patients that have an aggressive case of MS and who have not responded well to other FDA approved medications. Among such patients, the results from past trials have been very promising. In upto 87% of the cases, this reprogrammed immune system does not attack the myelin again and thereby stops further progression of the disease. It has also shown to significantly reduce the patient’s disability and patients show continued recovery even after 4 years post treatment.But, the best of the insurance programs do not cover this procedure, as it is not FDA approved yet, which has put the entire burden of raising the money for this procedure on us.The last time the insurance did not cover her treatment MS dealt a swift and devastating blow. We are fully committed to defeating MS this time around.And with your help, we will be a step closer to achieving that goal.We don’t have much to offer you other than our gratitude. All we can say, is thanks for supporting us in our fight. There are a few ways in which you can choose to donate and help us out. You can read about this in the More Info section.You can also help by sharing this link on social media. Tag your friends you think might help. Also share this with friends and family who might be suffering from diseases like Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, progressive scleroderma or other forms of autoimmune disease. The same treatment mentioned above can help turn around their lives too.If we do manage to go beyond our goals, we will donate all the excess money to the next patient who is eligible for this trial and for whom the insurance does not cover this life changing procedure.",600,1.2k,0,584,10 days,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He is also one of the kindest, most intelligent, charming and delightful people you could ever hope to meet. He is beloved by his many friends and students for his contagious enthusiasm and love of painting as well as his dedication to his students’ individual artistic development. Last year he was diagnosed with a stage 4 high-risk, aggressive form of prostate cancer. There were no warning signs, so as those of you who have been through this type of ordeal will understand, our world was flipped upside down. His prostate surgery was followed by two more surgeries to address complications, three blood transfusions and 3 weeks in intensive care. Once this ordeal was over, the healing process began for Patrick but the cancer reasserted itself in mid July. Things turned worrisome again. In September, he was placed on a new cancer protocol, in fact he was the first cancer patient at the Kimmel Cancer Center to be on this innovative therapy. By November he was responding positively, but the treatment has serious side-effects: soreness, limb pain, and the worst side-effect of all, chronic fatigue.
The good news is that he continues to respond positively to the therapies and medications. The cancer cells remain inactive; the downside is that the soreness, limb pain and the chronic fatigue intensified. It has limited Patrick’s time to teach and lecture. His painting, his lifetime passion, has also been limited. The loss of income over the past year, along with the growing medical bills not covered by insurance, has made it necessary for us to ask for help. Patrick works as much as possible, exercises regularly and intensely to combat the fatigue, and never loses faith he can continue to fight. We have 18 months more of treatment, including radiation, and I have no doubt that Patrick will carry on with the same grace and enthusiasm that is his nature. The slogan we have adopted at our house is to be “cautiously optimistic and aggressively positive.” The outpouring of love and support from our families, friends, and neighbors and, of course, from his Cancer Team at Kimmel Cancer Center, has been an enormous blessing. While it is stressful and difficult to ask for financial help, we find ourselves falling behind. Every little bit helps. Please donate. Thank you.",565,1.6k,14,565,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

In early March 2018, Jane started having strange symptoms: facial spasms, numbness, and weakness on her left side.  An MRI revealed a tumor on the right side of her brain.  Living close to New York City, Jane was able to get exceptional medical care. Surgery on March 14 resulted in the removal of 95 percent of the tumor. While her surgery was successful, the type of cancer she has — glioblastoma — is aggressive and may come back. Within the next month, Jane will undergo intensive treatment, including radiation, chemotherapy and a clinical trial at Sloane-Kettering. This next phase of treatment is arduous and costly.



After digesting this news, we decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf. Jane has not been able to work since her diagnosis and will not be able to work throughout the course of her treatment, which will also create a significant financial hardship for her family. She will and has already incurred significant expenses due to her recent neurosurgery, hospital stay and rehabilitation. These medical expenses are adding up quickly and will be prohibitive.Jane’s wonderful spirit has touched so many people. We hope that we 


can raise $75,000 to help defray her medical costs and ease her family’s financial burden which will allow her to focus on beating cancer.You can keep up with her latest progress and share your well wishes on her Facebook page.We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking an interest in this very dear cause.   (Jane and her sister Nan)

The pregnancy was going well until complications started to emerge. Then the beginnings of a heart-breaking nightmare began to unfold. Little Aaron was born prematurely on Wednesday, August 1st and was delivered by emergency C-section. His health took a sharp downturn when he suddenly stopped breathing. Aaron was taken to the ICU where it was discovered he had an infection. Worse, Claire also came down with an infection that required immediate surgery. It was so aggressive, that Claire had four separate surgeries to remove all of it (it had invaded a large amount of tissue including several organs). The doctors worked frantically to eradicate the infection, but sadly, didn't expect her to live.  By a miracle, Claire has beat the odds, but she is still in critical condition. As with any medical treatment, the cost (so far) of treating her and her newborn son has been astronomical. Zack has been with his wife the entire time so their income has stopped. The continued treatment and recovery will take months and will certainly be financially devastating. It is hard to determine how much all the bills will add up to, but Zack and Claire are in urgent need of financial assistance to help them cover all the costs and stay on their feet. In the meantime, prayers are requested and much appreciated.

Nutter in no way intends to benefit financially from this fund and 100% of the donations raised will go directly to the Atkinson Family to assist with any financial expenses incurred during the surgery and recovery process.  Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.",619,1.7k,8,624,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Jen was in the 31st week of her first pregnancy and thought of nothing but the baby’s health. Within two days, doctors located two embolisms-one in Jen’s heart and one in her lung, as well as a “mass” in her heart. The “mass” turned out to be angio-sarcoma, a very rare form of cancer.On Friday, April, 6, 2018, Jen underwent her first chemotherapy treatment. She will continue to have weekly treatments of chemotherapy until doctors are able to deliver her baby at 37 weeks. Her treatments will resume two weeks after the baby is born. There are simply no words that can adequately describe the fear and the heartache Jen and her husband Matt have endured these past two weeks.Jen and Matt were made for each other. They met while volunteering for Youth Group, a program designed to provide academic opportunities for children in need. Through their shared love of history (they are both teachers), travel, education, and volunteerism, they fell in love and married in 2008. I met Jen when she started teaching at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Currently, Jen teaches Advanced Placement U. S. History and Psychology, a demanding schedule for any veteran teacher, but Jen’s dedication and hard work quickly made her one of the most respected members of the faculty.Jen is the type of teacher who spends countless hours before and after school helping students, some of whom are not even in her classes, with their schoolwork. She is constantly organizing fieldtrips, advising clubs, and volunteering her time to those in need. Every year Jen lets her hair grow, only to cut and donate it to The Jimmy Fund’s program that provides wigs for cancer patients. Just last year, Jen was voted the “Most Inspirational Teacher” and was also awarded “Teacher of the Year.” As a person, Jen is the most selfless person I know. She’s never too busy to sit down with a colleague. Take today for instance, while in intensive care Jen sent out a group text to our department reminding us of a colleague’s birthday, even apologizing for not being able to make his favorite dessert. There has never been a birthday or special occasion Jen has not remembered and celebrated.When Jen and Matt found out they were expecting a baby, it was a dream come true for them. Their excitement was infectious, both had dreamt of being parents. But since March 31th, their life will never be the same. Jen and Matt are both teachers and the medical bills are starting to pile up. Matt works in Providence, RI and has been making the daily trip from Providence to Boston to be with his best friend. Unfortunately, there is a long road ahead.With all the anxiety and fear they are experiencing, the financial burden is one that we are hoping to alleviate. Please consider donating to help Jen and Matt on their long journey but most of all, please pray for them. Thank you and please share this message, as I know Jen would be doing everything in her power to help anyone else in this situation.Sincerely,Mindy Morin",954,1.7k,12,956,4 months,19 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

As you know my favorite things to share are my kids and people helping people. My goal in to show you how awesome my family is or to make you smile. There is so much negativity in the world i like to share the good things. I don’t share much personal stuff on here so this next post is going to be quite hard for me. There is a part of my story that I have kept silent for some time now. Every time I open up about it I seem to gain a new understanding or some knowledge that may help me. I am not ashamed, I was just hoping to tell this story from the other side but it’s taking a little longer than I hoped. If you’ve been wondering why i haven’t been around or as involved as much as usual, here’s why! So….Feb. 23rd 2017, I got a phone call telling me that I had metastatic melanoma. Yes, a phone call! I had a swollen lymph node on my right side, went to a surgeon and had it removed. Feb. 23rd they called and told me what it was. If you want to hear about how horribly they delivered the news I can tell you in person. But, lets not dwell on the lame parts of this story!. So, here’s the deal. I got some scans immediately and nothing else showed up. I was elated!!! The doctors at SCCA at Evergreen put me on immunotherapy as a “insurance” plan. It’s called adjuvent therapy. Well, this therapy made me super sick last summer. I was sick from the 5th of July until about the 15th. (103 degree temp etc…). They took me off this therapy and gave me a high dose of prednisone. That is the worst good drug out there. If you’ve ever had it, you know what i am talking about. It makes you feel like you drank 16 cups of coffee and you are severely agitated. (sorry Jessie)Sept. 2017 we did a scan and found 6 new locations of potential disease. Two of which are on my liver (no bueno). I started a new immunotherapy called pembrolizimab (same as Keytruda ads on TV) and this had a mixed response but was not working as well as we hoped so, they placed me on a “clinical trial”. I tried that for a while, it sucked; bad side effects and had to get shots in my stomach daily for a while. The side effects have been rough. I had some serious migraines (which I never suffered from before), hearing loss, ringing in my ears, cluster headaches with stroke like symptoms etc… (Thank you Mercer Island Fire Dept., I hoped I would never have to call you but you were great). Needless to say some of the side effects have sucked! Good news, almost all of them have reversed!!! Yeah! I did some scans after being in the trial for a while and they found that I had 26% tumor progression. They allow up to 20% but 26% was too high so they took me off of the trial. The good news is my tumors were really small so 26% progression means they are still small. This brings us to now. I recently got in touch with some friends who encouraged me to go to CA to get some opinions. I have seen doctors at UCLA and MD Anderson in Texas. I have been to Texas two times in the last two weeks and have had a couple of tumors removed in the event we try T-cell therapy in the future. Right now I am eagerly awaiting to find out what my next treatment plan will be. I had surgery last week and am still recovering. It has been very painful but getting better slowly. The good news is that although my diagnosis is ""stage 4 metastatic melanoma"" there are a number of different treatment options still available to me. (the stages are based off of the last 10 years of survival rates. The medications today were not even available 2 years ago) I am an optimist to a fault as you all know. This has been a hard battle and will continue to be hard but I WILL WIN! I repeat, I WILL WIN!. I would love any and all support you can spare. I am a helper and i am terrible at asking for help when i need it. I want to give a big shout out to my wife Jessie and my Family. There is no way i could do this without them. Jessie has taken care of all the paperwork (there is TONS) so i can just focus on being healthy and not thinking about it until i need to. Jessie is a rockstar and i am thankful for her daily. My parents and in laws have helped us with airfare and hotel stays while traveling to all these appointments. I didn't think having an illness could require so much travel and travel is expensive, especially when it's last minute. Not worrying about the financial burden of these trips has been amazing. Thank you to everyone that already knows and has been helping silently. There are many of you that have provided prayer, hugs, dinners etc. This is the first time in my life i have been dealt something i can't ""handle"" on my own. I have learned a lot over this past year and continue to learn daily. first and foremost i have learned i need to lean on other people when i need them. Don’t be offended if I didn’t tell you about this. I shared this with few people hoping it would be a quick battle and i could tell my story when it was over. What can you do/How can you help:-I DON’T KNOW HOW YOU CAN HELP, IM TERRIBLE AT ASKING FOR HELP!-DO NOT TALK ABOUT THIS IN FRONT OF MY KIDS!(they know but let me handle any discussions about it)-DON’T TREAT ME LIKE IM SICK(if you do, i may punch you in the throat and ask how you are This is a part of my story now, what it means to be Kirk Robinson, K-Rob, Kirky, Nino, hollywood, surfer boy or whatever you may call me. I wouldn't have picked this part of the story line, that's for sure. No sense being upset at the cards your dealt, just play them the best you can! I have met several people along this journey that i wouldn't have met otherwise. I am thankful for their support and their encouragement to share my story! Jim Brown, Ann Jarris Adam Throop, Melinda McKinley-throop, Rob Sweet and my ""text prayer group"". One group of people Monster and Sea heard my story through a friend and i found a card in my mailbox with some money to help us out. Timing could not have been better! I was so choked up that a group of people would want to help like this. It meant more than you can imagine!Please keep me and my family in your prayers! I know God has control over this. I pray daily that my eyes are open to the things around me and that i will be healed. I am a Blessed man, I am so lucky to have the family and friends that i do. I am thankful daily!HERES TO KICKING CANCERS ASS!!!!!

Medical,12,Help for special needs kid/moving,https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid,"MACON, GA","May 25, 2018","$75,000","$63,210","https://youtu.be/_Owd9bx-RCUHello, thank you for taking time to read my campaign for our son, David. Like any family, when our son hurts, we hurt. When my husband wakes up our son for school in the mornings it tears my soul apart when he tells me when I get home from work that David has vomited in his sleep because he had a seizure. The thought that he could have died right there in his bed is the worst possible nightmare that We could ever have and the fear of it becoming reality set us in motion to save our son. A kind service dog has eased, but not erased the worry and dread by standing guard of him and being able to detect and alert to the oncoming seizures so  that my husband can now half way sleep knowing that he will hear her cries for help when David’s voice is gone.The Doctors tried him on many medications (some all at once) to try and stop the seizures as he was having them daily. These medications almost cost him his life just because of their chemical nature. We trusted these Doctors that their medical expertise with these medications were in David’s best interest, past my own knowledge, my husband researched them and wow the side effects, and then watched these dangerous chemicals that are prescribed in good faith have a different chemical reaction in our son that could not have been foreseen, the seizures got worse, our son has fought many times for his life with Doctors fighting to bring him back and keep him here. David has a service dog, seizures, seizure medications, and Doctors. What he doesn’t have is the ability to be a child because the seizures have stolen his childhood from him. He cannot even ride his bike to the park with friends. What would happen if he had a seizure crossing the street? He cannot go to school and enjoy when he is so tired and recovering from days of seizures to the point he was going to have to be isolated even more and taught at home. David cannot just go be a kid with his friends because “What if this is THE seizure that We have been tearing our hearts and brains  apart to stop, and prayerfully begging that never comes. Neither of us can protect him in his own bed, let alone away from home. His dog helps detect and alert, but she would not be able to render the medical care that he would need. We would have to just trust that some stranger would recognize it, and call for help. Also hope that someone driving the street where he fell did not look down at the radio, or to another distraction for a split second and hit David or Malory. Can any father or mother  in good faith trust their child’s life to the hands of potential strangers? If a parent did, would they have their child’s best interest? Are we really doing the right thing by imprisoning him for any reason and watching his childhood pass him by? How do We keep from hating ourselves because we are supposed to be able to fix this and protect him? What can We do? Nobody can save our son, and neither of us are willing to accept letting him go, or his innocence of catching lightening bugs and bringing me a wilted flower that he had in his pocket for an hour or the dead bug to his dad that he accidentally sat on die in our faces. His eyes search us for help, and we have none.In February 2018, after my husband did some researching and wrestling with the idea, asking myself about the law, the thought of giving something illegal to our child that was for our entire childhood “a bad and dangerous drug,” we started treating him with Marijuana. Unfortunately it is still illegal here in Georgia. We had plans and hopes of getting him on a good track with school, and referred out of state to better and broader medical practices. We both demanded to know what is going into our child, and while we did everything we could to know, neither of us had any legal access to a Doctor’s experience with different kinds. We knew the risks that we read, the medical research that We both had to pour over for hours fighting what is right/legal/safe/moral, I informed all of his medical team because we wanted our son to be safe. I was not advised to stop treating him this way along with safer medications from the Doctor. The Doctor did not comment exactly why, but I think she wanted to see for herself. The combination granted our son 71 days seizure FREE!!!!! For 71 days our son rode his bike, woke up, went to school, played with friends, played outside, and the terror for his life that gripped our hearts and souls began to lift. The smiles on our faces reflecting our child getting to be a normal child. Safe in his bed. Doing better in school. Having a great quality of life. We were breaking the law. We saved our son. We were fixing the fragments the best way we could of him being that little boy that was taken away from him by these seizures. This is our job as parents, to protect our child even with our own lives. As I wrote above, I kept his medical team up to date. As we felt we had found his miracle, and anyone else who saw his medical history would see this too. We also felt like his entire medical team truly cared for him and wanted the same things we did, and with honesty on my part and his safety forefront of every visit, we were winning. This transparency also meant informing a new therapist who did not share our joys or beliefs that allowing him access to marijuana was worth this new life he had begun. I was reported to DCFS, and on April 19, 2018 their representatives along with deputy sheriff’s entered our home with our cooperation and full truth of what and why, and despite the evidence, demanded that I stop “abusing” our son by giving him this “dangerous” marijuana. Allowing him to have debilitating seizures that threaten his life and any quality of that life was quite okay as long as he was not using marijuana. They did not even apply his medical team’s observations and findings to their opinions. If you are unsure what is worse, look up seizure medication side effects. Then look up medical research for marijuana usage as seizure treatment. Compare the two with success rates, side effects, birth defects that are known, long term effects that are known, what class of drug they are in by abuscability, pretend David is your child, and tell us honestly that following the law, but risking his life is better than trying something that is illegal, but with mountains of medical data as to it’s worth as a treatment to the point on becoming legal in certain states. We stood behind our decision to save our son’s life even though we had not made the move yet, and openly admitted to allowing him to use it for the treatment of his seizures. We have never lied about where he got it, or our intentions. The DCFS demanded that we cease this immediately. Against our better judgement, we did. They were not there for the times my husband had to drag our son to the truck because it takes 45 minutes for help to arrive. They were not there for the times that we carried him out of the house to break the traffic laws to get him the help he so desperately needed. They were not there to see my husband loose several jobs because we were rushing our son to get medical help. They were not there when we spent almost 3 months in an emergency room everyday because our son was being transported because he’d done had another seizure either at home or at school, or that 2 weeks out of those 3 months was spent at a hospital in Atlanta begging the doctors to take him off the medication that was killing him. There was no way we could afford to get him to a state that could help him fast enough to stop what we both knew was coming and even told the DCFS representative and officer. Even working two jobs as I do and the 4 that my husband does. There was a small hope that once they could see his seizures returning, and his Doctor’s recommendations that they would see we were not any of those other types of the parents that they see so often it hardens their hearts to only seeing laws and what the state deems acceptable parenting. Maybe they would allow me just enough time to get him to the help of a medical center in an appropriate state. Within14 hours of the marijuana being stopped without consulting his Doctor, even with the safer seizure medications still administered, his service dog was alerting my husband as I was filling out paperwork for the DCFS office, David’s eyes filled with dread, fear, and hopelessness as all Matthew could do was watch it happen and get him to the hospital, and before my heart could even beat, he was in the grips of this horrible, evil, monster that threatens his life again. We felt sure they would see now. We felt sure they would not be able to ignore the obvious and blatant evidence in front of their faces, and the loss of childhood in our son’s face. This was not correct. While our son fought for his life, officially in DCFS custody and flatlining 15 times according to medical records, my husband was arrested, they tore me from my baby’s side and told me they were going to take custody of him as I was arrested too. They say he is not safe with us while a medical team tries to start his heart again because they have stopped his treatment by what they know of the law and their opinion. Then by opinion of the hospital’s police staff, my son’s service dog was removed and put into the city pound without allowing me the federally mandated, and legally protected, reasonable amount of time to seek someone to take custody of her. The officer from what I understand of the service dog laws outlined by the ADA website, violated federal law that protects these working animals and their handlers. We broke a state law in hopes of saving my son. In turn, our son’s federal rights as protected under the ADA laws were violated because of ignorance of what the laws state regarding service animal identification, and the federal laws dictating how a service dog with an incapacitated handler must be treated. How do we at the least help this department repair their ignorance of the federal laws? I asked people who advocate for the understanding of laws concerning service animals if I was incorrect in what I read. They explained what the laws state for each thing specifically that happened. They cannot legally tell me who was right or wrong as we all have a right to tell our own side of every story without the assumption of guilt. On my own reporting, I did, in fact, understand the laws that I believe were violated. I now have an obligation to become an advocate myself when our son is back in our arms and living his beautiful, young life.She is our son’s link to the conscious world when he is trapped in the grips of those seizures and cannot cry for help himself. She is his voice, his hero, and his Angel. She has a job that has improved all of our lives from him choking on his own vomit in his sleep because she will make sure someone hears her and gets to him. Instead of being treated as a valuable life and life saving dog, she was thrown into her own type of prison for 7 days. “Actually innocent, but decidedly guilty based on ignorance of the law” is what I would name that kind of charge. Seven days this life saving animal went without anyone she knew, strange foods, strange scheduling, strange dogs (who knows if they were friendly or not), exposure to a myriad of diseases, and was treated like an animal thrown away.  Vaccinations are our first line defense, but they do, on occasion fail our dogs. She risks that when she leaves our house. Just as we risk being attacked by a shark if we swim in the ocean. We know the risk, and that is why we do not jump into known, high shark activity laden waters with an open wound. Pounds cannot help except to be a possible breeding ground for diseases. They must house stray dogs whether they know the histories of the dogs or not. They cannot deny going and picking up a dog reported just because they do not know if it has had vaccinations. They can quarantine if equipped for that, and if the pound has adequate space and vet staff. Our son’s service dog is priceless in alerting to get David help, and she was cast aside just like our son’s childhood and quality of life. She has this way that is unique to them to speak to his whole mind and assure him that he is going to open his eyes to her again. She is amazing, and deserves to always be treated as such. We do not want to risk losing the only link we have to him to assure him that Matt and mommy are fighting for him when he cannot see and hear us. This wonderful, furry, angel tells him so. She wants her boy back almost as much as we do.Because of all of this, we want to move our child and family to a state with the medical resources to help him. We have found a lawyer who is the best of the best. She has reviewed and has been very optimistic in her ability to help us get our son back, and move him to a place where he can be monitored with regulated, specially grown marijuana that is designed to treat his individual needs uniquely. Our son deserves life. I am asking for help to save our son. Please donate if you are able so that we can hire this attorney and save him. If you are unable to donate, please understand that we are in deepest appreciation of prayers for our son to be okay and be a little boy riding his bike, and looking forward to going to school again, and so proud and excited when he learns new things and makes good grades. This just hurts so badly. We feel so afraid for him, and everything in both of us cries and screams to save him. We do not know if he is being cared for like a child or a case number. We only hear things that bother us deeply, and all we can do is turn it over to the lawyer to now fight the greatest battle of our lives in having our heart returned to us safe and sound and knowing that we now know the correct path of helping him, and can do this the legal way. It has proven to be the correct way by the medical evidence of only 71 days alone. Please, help us if you are able. We only want our baby back and to see him play and grow without fear of these seizures that were stealing him away from us before he was taken away by DCFS. We want all of him back, and have proven that we will do anything to protect him. The difference is that now, we are educating ourselves on the correct way, and imagining an even better outcome for his health with the proper care.Thank You! https://www.gofundme.com/legal-help-for-special-needs-kid?sharetype=teams&member=227462&rcid=r01-152732054834-745a05a4a60247a6&pc=ot_co_campmgmt_m",988,2.5k,20,959,3 months,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She has an amazing story below, having already survived a previously incurable cancer. Please share her story with your social networks so we can raise awareness! We would deeply appreciate you helping her to write a happy ending, again. *** “For nearly as long as I can remember I have referred to Lexi Thomas as my sister. While she is technically my sister-in-law, that couldn’t matter less. She is a light in the world.” I first wrote those words 19 months ago, well before we could have known how Lexi’s journey would unfold. Lexi had been diagnosed with a cancer so rare that it had never been seen in a living patient, and after four years of fighting to stay alive, we found that we needed to raise thousands of dollars very quickly to get her into a high-risk, high-reward clinical trial. That trial was to be her last chance at life, culminating in a “reaction” that would either cause her death, or she would live and be cured.  With the help of more than 500 amazing individual donors we raised the money in time, got Lexi into the trial, and prayed for a miracle. On November 7th, her reaction came. Surrounded by her doctors from NIH, Duke and John’s Hopkins, her brain swelled, her heart stopped, and she died. For twenty long minutes, she was gone. But, we got our miracle. With a Herculean effort from her doctors, she fought to come back to us, and months later we found out that she had indeed beaten the previously incurable cancer. Not only did Lexi come back to us, she came back whole, and with a purpose. In the year that followed, more than 10,000 people, many of them young adults living with cancer, became readers of Lexi’s blog. The National Cancer Institute honored her with their “Young Adult of Great Influence” Award at the Angel Ball in New York City, and she got a boyfriend, of whom we all totally approve. Please check out her blog here if you would like to learn more about her story:  https://lexthomas11.wordpress.com We have started this new GoFundMe because while the incurable cancer remains beaten, Lexi again finds herself struggling to survive, this time fighting an aggressive new lymphoma that sprang up seemingly out of nowhere. As of this writing, she has been given 4-6 months to live if she doesn’t get treatment, and she’s again fighting like hell to stay with us, applying to every trial she might fit.  After being rejected from 211 trials in just the last nine months, lucky number 212 said yes! Now we have to raise the money to get her into this highly effective, and much safer immunotherapy trial. As before, this is likely her last chance at life, and we very much need to ask for your help again to beat this. In order to get into the trial, Lexi needs to start a new chemotherapy just a few weeks from now to keep her tumors from progressing. Radiation therapy has burned her too badly, and so this chemotherapy is her last option. The cost for the trial is a staggering $180,000. Fortunately, she only needs to put down a downpayment of $18,000 to start, but this does not count her bagged nutrition which costs $1,974 a week, her IV antibiotics, her hyperbaric chamber therapy to treat her radiation burns, and a litany of other expenses. Her medical debt now exceeds $300,000, but for now we want to raise $75,000 to get her into the trial and cover her critcial medical expenses for the next several months. Two years ago this community came together and helped to save Lexi’s life. She’s ready to fight again, and we need to ask you to help us make one more miracle for this young woman who has so powerfully touched so many lives. Please consider supporting this urgent goal, and make sure to share this campaign on your social networks. People often wonder if charitable campaigns are real, and it really, really helps to have folks who know and care about Lexi letting the world know that she is real, the need is real, and that they have a great opportunity to give the gift of life. Your support would mean the world to Lexi, and to our family. #lexistrong",738,1.0k,6,745,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

This diagnosis was the culmination of our attempts to find a solution to months of breastfeeding issues. Needless to say, it was unexpected.God’s care and favor has already been evident. In the week since diagnosis, Stephany has been able to meet with specialists and oncologists - a process that usually takes weeks, not days. Perhaps most notable is that Stephany and I were able to gain admission to a clinic that specializes in immunotherapy and holistic treatment of cancers, just two days after we received her diagnosis. This clinic has very high success rates when treating breast cancer. God’s favor in this cannot be understated; an appointment like this usually takes 2-3 months to secure.Please be in sustained prayer for Stephany, me, and our family as we journey down the long road of treatment and healing. Cancer diagnoses are never easy. But we know God. He has already done so much for us in this time, and we know he will continue to carry Stephany moving forward. We feel blessed to know we are surrounded by faith-filled, bible-practicing, Godly people, who are helping us to in our time of need. And because of people like you, we know that we don’t have anything to be anxious about as we work towards Stephany’s recovery.There’s certainly more that could be said, but for now I wanted to post to share with everyone and to ask for prayer. We will continue to share updates throughout this process.We love and are thankful for everyone and their support during this season.

-----------------------From Team Steph:The cancer that Steph has been diagnosed with is very aggressive. According to the Oncologist, the reason the cancer was not discovered any earlier was due to Steph breastfeeding her newborn, making detection incredibly challenging. Steph went from thinking she merely had mastitis to a full blown Stage IV Breast Cancer diagnosis. The reason it is stage IV is because it has spread to her lymphatic system, bones, liver, and lungs. The Oncologist wanted to start chemotherapy as soon as possible (apparently the person who installs the port for chemotherapy was on a vacation, so Steph wouldn’t be able to begin for another week). The Oncologist also wanted to put Steph in an immunotherapy, clinical trial, because he saw she was a good candidate for such recourse.Along with her Primary Care Physician, husband, and other counsel, Steph decided she wanted to further explore the immunotherapy approach. With the help of friends, the Dailey’s were able to hone it down to 3 specific clinics who were both reputable and experienced with this particular kind of cancer. Receiving her Stage IV diagnosis on Thursday morning, by Friday night Steph had two phone consultations with two different clinic doctors, and on Saturday was given a spot at the most reputable and successful of the clinics (the only of the clinics to have 3 American Certified Surgeon Oncologist on Staff and on location) - she would be able to move in and bring her newborn and husband that Sunday afternoon. Her treatment would begin with 20 intensive days as an in-patient. This hospital does a fusion of alternative and conventional forms of treatment, and her exact therapies and medicines would be prescribed upon arrival. They will take baseline measurements, including tumor markers to track progress. Chemo is still a likely possibility. She would then return home with a potent regimen of vitamins, meals, and other cancer treatment pharmaceuticals. Then she would return for a 7 day intensive to follow up, including retaking tumor markers, and then the Doctors would be able to suggest the next course of action. Because the clinic allowed Steph admission so quickly, the Dailey’s were not able to secure the funds in time, so rather than delaying until money was raised, the cost was negotiated to be paid with a deposit on a credit card (to be paid back through fundraising, God willing) and to have a future, upcoming payment to continue treatment (including the home regimen and 7 day follow up) due approximately 2 weeks from now - August 31st, 2018. On behalf of Steph, we are asking for a total of $50,000. $35,000 is for the 20 days of intensive in-patient treatment, plus the robust 3-month home therapy regimen, and the 7 day in-patient follow up back at the clinic. Another $5,000 is for the travel cost and related incidentals, roundtrip to the clinic both times. $10,000 is for other cancer treatment related costs while she’s at home for 3 months in between clinic stays, broken down to about $100 per day. This includes being able to switch the Dailey family over to non-toxic household products, and other related approaches to having a toxic free home. There are likely other costs, but at this time it is unpredictable as to what they would be considering how early Steph is into the treatment. However, this amount will be able to give the Dailey’s a sense of security related to their finances and keep Steph receiving the treatment she so desperately needs. If you can donate frequent flyer miles to help with travel, or have access to other resources for cancer patients, please contact us and let us know!Please join us in “Saving Steph.” Pray with us. Generously give with us.

Medical,13,Lauren's Killing Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/lauren039s-killing-cancer-fund,"WEST PALM BEACH, FL","July 25, 2018","$75,000","$62,025","Many of you are familiar with my business partner and my best friend, Lauren Greaves.  For those of you who don’t know Lauren well… She is firecracker. Gorgeous.  Funniest human I know.  A hot mess most days (in a good way), a super loyal friend, a blessed sister, daughter, aunt and all around crazy-awesome human being.  I for one, am blessed to have her in my life and I will do whatever I can do to KILL HER CANCER!  She is one of those friends who we all pray we find.  She is the type of friend who you can rely on and the one who always answers her phone at any hour of the day or night…. The one human in your life who will always deliver you pizza (or wine) at 2AM because that is ALL you need at that very moment to keep your sanity.  She is that person to me but also to countless others.  She is the best person I know.  Surprisingly, in May 2018, Lauren was diagnosed with cancer.  Aggressive Cancer.  The story:Two years ago, by way of self-examination, Lauren noticed a small lump on her breast. As an active 31-year-old, she thought little of it, but decided to do the prudent thing and visit the doctor for a consultation. After a brief examination, she was casually informed that the area of concern was in fact, benign, and there was nothing to worry about. So, Lauren went on living her life as she normally did, that is, until May of 2018… During what was intended to be a routine check-up, Lauren mentioned to her doctor that she felt like the benign lump had grown since her last visit. Shortly thereafter, she was thrown into a series of scans, tests, pokes and prods in an effort to determine what the growth was and why it had changed so drastically. Anyone who has been even remotely suspected of having cancer can attest to the fact that the following days/ weeks searching for a definitive conclusion can be the most grueling and mentally challenging as the prognosis seemingly changes minute by minute.  All that said, on May 15th, Lauren was diagnosed with Stage 3 Invasive Intraductal Carcinoma of the right breast. Beyond this, her cancer is “aggressive,” having already manifested itself in her lymph nodes. Should it continue beyond her lymph nodes, the doctors would deem it metastatic, or simply put, a death sentence. However, she is “lucky,” and her diagnosis, albeit Stage 3, is treatable. While the prognosis is optimistic, Lauren still has a long road ahead of her. Her killing-cancer journey begins with 8 rounds of an aggressive form of Chemotherapy (AC-T) AKA “The Red Devil.”  Her treatment started July 12thand will continue bi-weekly until late October. From there, she is allotted a brief two-week “vacation” from the drugs to heal, then a scan to make sure there was in fact a reduction in the size of tumors and then onto prep for her impending Double Mastectomy and Lymph Node Removal. Following those procedures, she will undergo Phase 1 of Reconstruction, immediately followed by 30 rounds of Radiation. After radiation, the second phase of reconstruction commences and if all goes according to plan, Lauren will be on the road to recovery by late spring 2019. In the meantime, her doctors have begun preparing her for full loss of hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, and even possibly fingernails and toenails. An additional bi-product of the chemotherapy is typically extensive damage to the ovaries and eggs.  Since Lauren has not had children of her own (YET), over the past 8 weeks she has been attempting to freeze her eggs in hopes of possibly, one day, having a biological child. Sadly, during the process, she was also diagnosed with a condition called DOR, or Diminished Ovarian Reserves, meaning she doesn’t have many eggs to freeze. She reluctantly delayed her chemo in order to try and squeeze in a second round of IVF, as the first round was less than fruitful. Although insurance covers infertility for men, it does NOT cover infertility for women, even with a Cancer diagnosis (BANANAS! Can you imagine this nonsense?). Each round is between $15,000 - $18,000. As her Cancer is estrogen-based, Lauren will also be induced into menopause at the age of 33 and remain there for at least 10 years in hopes of deterring the cancer from returning. Menopause is no-joke for a 50+ year old woman but for a robust 33 year old… I can’t express to you the mental anguish.  Trust me, this is NOT something any woman wants to face, especially NOT Lauren! My goal with this Go-Fund-Me page is help Lauren pay off her egg retrievals (which she already owes $32,000) but also help her fund some of the cancer-killing treatments.  Although Lauren is employed and Sarah and I will work our tails off to make sure she has a steady income, she will be working less and obviously taking in less income for the next 1-2 years.  Additionally, Lauren has less than desirable insurance and I would love to be able to help her pay some of her insurmountable medical bills.   Anything you can to help Lauren, ANY AMOUNT BIG OR SMALL is much appreciated and will not go unnoticed.    Sincerely and with much love and appreciation,Sabra Kirkpatrick and Sarah Koenig",325,1.1k,10,322,1 month,9 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

It is hard to believe that we are writing this about the situation facing our good friend Duncan Campling and his family.Duncan is 47 years old, & at the prime of his life, suffered a devastating Brain Stem Stroke on March 15, 2018. The news about Duncan is very  hard to comprehend, because he was healthy, going on about with his life and suddenly he had a stroke and was hospitalized in critical condition in the intensive care Unit.We have launched this GoFundMe campaign because this situation has a huge financial impact on Duncan and his young family; both in terms of covering the costs of his long-term care and his ability to provide for his family. Duncan needs our support. The simple facts are that this devastating ‘brain-stem stroke’ has left him in a long-term state of almost total incapacity. His medical care team is labeling his condition as “Locked-In syndrome”, which among other things means he has severe paralysis and is currently only able to communicate via eye and head movement. Duncan has full cognitive function and is fully aware of his situation. He has been moved from the hospital ICU to an Acute Therapy Hospital in suburban Philadelphia.Duncan has been an amazing and reliable friend to many people for so many years. We all know Duncan as gregarious, adventurous, full of life, easy to talk to, quick to laugh and make others laugh, generous and always one to pitch in and help whenever needed. More importantly Duncan has been an amazing husband to Veronica and loving father to Brent, 7 yrs old and Jason, 5 yrs old.Due to the severe and ongoing nature of Duncan's condition, there is serious concern about the costs involved in his long-term care as his insurance options start to diminish. We have set up this ‘gofundme’ page to help Duncan, Veronica, Brent and Jason for two reasons: -        To raise funds to address Duncan’s long-term care needs and provide supplementary aid for his family during this period of transition.-        To raise funds for medical equipment that will help Duncan regain as much independence as possible during recovery. Duncan needs among others specific technology such as an eye-tracking computer system to allow communication and a specialized, motorized wheelchair. Duncan is a fighter and has been intensely focused and determined to regain function through intensive therapy. With your support, we are hopeful that he will make progress towards a positive and fulfilling future.Together, Let's fight for Duncan!

(He is my husband's nephew, but in reality he is more like a brother to both of us, someone we spend the majority of our weekends with on the lake, in the woods and around the campfire.)  Dan has been an active outdoorsman his entire life, spending nearly all of his spare time camping, fishing, hunting, boating and enjoying life with his fiance and best friend, Ashley, as well as his family and friends. Everywhere Dan goes he has his two young children, Natalee and Nicholas, in his arms or attached to his hip. A highly productive individual, he is an extremely valued employee and a foreman with our company. Honest, hard-working and loyal, Dan is absolutely irreplaceable. He is smart, practical, independent and motivated, and he is admired, loved and respected by everyone around him. Dan has always, always been ready and willing at any given moment to help his family and friends ( and even strangers) no matter their needs or situations.The accident.On March 20, 2018 Dan was performing his job duties as a mechanical insulator, installing pipe insulation on piping located approximately 20' above ground. Working out of a scissor lift with a platform, he extended to reach a section of pipe when he lost his balance and fell to the dirt and gravel floor below. Upon impact with the ground he suffered multiple broken ribs, a punctured lung, a broken scapula, and burst fractures of his T9 and T10 vertebrae.Diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.Dan was immediately transported to UPMC Hamot and has undergone surgery to stabilize his spine. He will endure another surgery to repair his scapula before he is transferred to an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh on or around March 28.Dan has suffered a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) below the vertebral fracture sites, effectively losing all feeling and movement below the middle of his abdomen. The neurosurgeon has indicated that his paralysis is permanent.Upon transfer from the ICU in Hamot to the acute rehabilitation facility in Pittsburgh, he will endure an intense 4-6 week therapy program to prepare him for his return home.Dan's life after SCIDan will have a team of physicians and therapists in Pittsburgh that he will be visiting frequently after his release from the rehab program. Additionally, Dan will continue outpatient rehabilitation closer to home.It is Dan's goal that he will return to many, if not all, of his previous hobbies as well as work in the future. His family and friends have been working tirelessly since the accident to assemble a solid support system to help him reach his goals.Dan will need renovations to his home. However, even with these changes, his current home will not be able to serve as his permanent home. There are an abundance of safety issues and there is no way to adequately expand the home to provide him the space he needs.In addition to the impending struggles of trying to adjust to their new life, especially with two young children, Dan and Ashley will need a new ADA-designed and equipped home in the near future.How can Dan's family and friends help?Dan, Ashley and their family are grateful to the innumerable amount of people who have reached out to them asking how they can help. After much careful thought, assistance toward a safe and comfortable home has been determined to be the greatest need. Preliminarily, they have every intention to stay as close as possible to their immediate family. We are hoping that we can alleviate some of the burden that comes with such a major life change and help them with a home that fits their family's new needs.There are no words to express how thankful we all are for your thoughtfulness, your compassion, your contributions and your willingness to support Dan, Ashley, Natalee and Nicholas.",242,811,3,235,5 months,4 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Doctors were able to eradicate 3 of the tumors with Gamma Knife radiosurgery but the 4th tumor was too large for Gamma Knife and required brain surgery.  I had brain surgery, started taking targeted therapy medication and went back to living my life for the next 10 months until the medication stopped working.  New scans showed that I had 3 new brain tumors.  Doctors treated these tumors with Gamma Knife, discontinued the targeted therapy medication and put me on immunotherapy infusions.  A few months into this and one of the tumors that had been previously treated started to enlarge; I had to have a 2nd brain surgery.In the summer of 2016, a few months after my 2nd brain surgery, scans showed that melanoma was now in my spine.  I had radiation and started on a clinical trial.  Within months, I started experiencing back pain.  Cancer had returned to my spine and I needed surgery.  After the surgery, I experienced a major complication; my intestines perforated and I almost died.  I had to have emergency surgery and an ileostomy.  If you don’t know what an ileostomy is, trust me, it was awful.  With this complication, I could not be on any cancer treatment and so in early 2017, the cancer returned to my spine and I had to have my 2nd spine surgery and 2nd round of radiation.  A few months later, I had surgery to get rid of my ileostomy; which was great but I’m still not the same, at least as far as my guts are concerned.Whenever I meet a new doctor who has seen my chart but never met me, they are always surprised.  They tell me that I look a lot better in person than I do on paper and that I am lucky to be alive.  I have a tremendous support team.  My wife Dana has been by my side every step of the way and I truly don’t think I would be alive if it weren’t for her.  She is amazing.This past few weeks have been rough.  My most recent scans show a new tumor in my brain and enlarging tumors in my spine and lymph node.  I will have Gamma Knife tomorrow to take care of the tumor in my brain.As for my spine, the surgeons and radiologists that I have consulted with are concerned that a 3rd surgery or 3rd dose of radiation to my spine could cause permanent damage.  My radiologist has referred me to Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York.  MSK recommends proton therapy as the safest way to alleviate the tumor on my spine.  Unfortunately, my insurance does not agree and has deemed this as “not medically necessary”.  “Not medically necessary” Hearing these words has been shocking and stressful.  Up until now, insurance has always paid their part and I have always paid mine.  I will appeal this decision, but in the meantime, a big part of what has kept me alive so far is moving forward based on the recommendations of experts.  I will not let this slow me down and am moving forward.  I have my initial appointment at the proton therapy center on Friday.As for the lymph node, my oncologist has referred me to MD Anderson in Houston where I would have surgery to remove the lymph node and hopefully will be a candidate for their TIL program – more on that later as we are still working on getting this moving.  When I sat down to write this, I didn’t intend for it to be so long.  But then I guess it has been a long journey. We’ve had so many friends and family help us with childcare, meals, shoveling snow, mowing our grass, praying and taking the time to ask how I am doing.  People Dana and I didn’t really know at the start of this have stood by our side and have become our best friends.  The support we have received has made all the difference.  Now as the cancer is progressing, and we are having to travel out of state to get the medical care I need, Dana and I are dealing with coordinating three different hospitals in three different states, travel, insurance, child care, missing work.   We are overwhelmed, scared and stressed.  A family member reminded me that there are many people out there who don’t live close but have asked what they can do - they can’t bring me dinner or watch my kids, but want to help – so, if you are one of those people, maybe you could help with this and check back every once in a while, to see how I am doing  My family:Some pictures from 2009:Gamma Knife Radiosurgery - this is what I have to look forward to tomorrow!After brain surgery - the baseball team I help coach signed this bat for me:)This was my first of many infusions!More surgeries:",254,439,9,255,2 months,12 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

I am a happy, fun loving boy who enjoys being around my family and playing with my friends. Some of my favorite activities include playing with trains, swimming in my new pool, and learning at school. On April 3rd, 2018 I was watching my favorite show when I began having a seizure. My mommy saw me having a seizure and called 911. They rushed me to the hospital where they began doing many tests including a scan of my head where they found a mass on my brain. This came as a major shock to my mommy and daddy. The doctors found that the mass on my brain was a tumor that needed to be operated on. On April 10th, I had brain surgery to remove the tumor and the doctors thought it looked “funny”. They sent it away to John Hopkins Children’s Hospital , St. Jude Children’s Research, and The University Stanford to identify what the tumor was. Unfortunately, it was determined that my tumor was in deed cancerous and of high grade. The doctors said that my tumor is Grade 4, Highly Aggressive Embryonal Cancer. As you could imagine, this broke mommy and daddy’s heart and made us all very scared. We don’t know what to expect, but we are hoping and praying for the best. The doctors said that I am going to need to undergo chemo therapy. There is a 65% chance that this cancer can be treated with chemo therapy, but 35% chance it can return. I am going to be going through 3-6 months of high dose chemo therapy to help stop the cancer from returning. The doctors say that I am going to be very sick as the chemo therapy is going to cause me to lose my hair, appetite and strength. I don't really understand what is going on, but I know mommy and daddy do and I can see that they are very scared. I am going to be staying at Jack Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami until I am better. Daddy is going to be supporting us by traveling back and forth to work and the hospital to be with me and mommy. Mommy is going to be with me around the clock and wont be able to work. As I go through this challenging next 3-6 month, I ask for your prayers to help me stay strong and for this cancer to never come back. I can't wait to be able to jump in my pool, play with my trains at home, and play with my friends once I get through this chemo therapy. I ask that you please help mommy and daddy in any way you can. They will be short income from mommy not being able to work and the medical bills they will have to deal with from me being sick.

Brother Natnael lost his father when he was 2 years old. Since his mother was unable to raise 3 boys by herself, she had to let Natnael live with his aunt. Life was very tough for him growing up. He lived through unbearable stress and physical abuse. He later developed a brain tumor that doctors believed caused by stress. He lost his vision because of the brain tumor. Doctors in Ethiopia don't have the means to perform this type of surgery. There is a hope for this young man to get his vision back but the procedure has to be done outside of Ethiopia. The family don’t have the means to cover the medical and travel expenses so we initially established this gofundme account to send Nathy to India for the procedure but with your overwhelming donations and support Nathy now has the opportunity to come to USA . We have currently raised $36,432 and need to get to 50,000.00.

Medical,15,Help my mom fight brain cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/5csg4-help-my-mom-fight-brain-cancer,"LOS ANGELES, CA","July 18, 2018","$100,000","$61,533","On June 18th, 2018 — the day after my last graduation ceremony — my mother was rushed to the ER after excruciating migraines that left her unable to walk and talk. Shortly after, we received the devastating diagnosis that she had an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor. Now, she is fighting for her life against stage IV brain cancer.


My Mom’s Story

For more than ten years, my mom worked as a restaurant waitress to single-handedly provide for our family of six. She regularly clocked over 100 hours a week and rarely took any time off in the decade that she spent waiting tables for thousands of customers. She taught herself the little English that she knows from memorizing menu items and took immense pride in being able to bring joy to people’s lives by serving them delicious food. For as long as I can remember, my mother’s always been a fighter. When my younger brother was diagnosed with a rare blood condition with no cure called hemophilia, she quickly learned from nurses how to inject medication to allow him to live a normal life. When my father was repeatedly incarcerated for domestic violence and drug addiction, she found ways to provide us safe, healthy, and nurturing environments to grow up in. My mother has survived homelessness and food insecurity, abuse and assault, and all while raising two kids and caring for her aging parents. Above all else, she’s modeled resilience, strength, and positivity in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Now, she’s facing what she considers to be just another hurdle to overcome: cancer. What HappenedMy family saved money for months to be able to afford to attend my graduation weekend at UCLA. My mom was especially excited — it was her first real vacation in years and it was also her first time visiting California. However, throughout their stay, she began to experience increasingly aggressive migraines that left her bedridden. For years, my mom has had regular headaches and bouts of forgetfulness, but we always thought that it was from her overworking herself at the restaurant.After she was sent to the ER, we learned that these weren’t normal signs of exhaustion; they were symptoms of an aggressive, late-stage brain tumor called glioblastoma, which has a five-year survival rate of just 5%.Once my mom was admitted to the hospital, doctors found that her tumor had grown so much that brain matter that should have been in the middle of her head had been pushed all the way to one side. Neurosurgeons had to place a shunt in her brain to relieve the pressure of the swollen mass. In the last month, her condition has quickly deteriorated; she’s been put on breathing tubes, her muscles have withered away, and she's been put on an intense regime of steroids, antibiotics, and other medication.The Road AheadMy mom has always been vigorously active, from working as a physical education teacher in China to dashing between tables as a waitress in Michigan. She’ll be transitioning from a fiercely independent lifestyle to one where she’ll need assistance with simple tasks like using the restroom and brushing her teeth. The initial bill that we received after only one week of hospitalization was almost $148,000. This amount has since tripled and is still growing. Because my mom is not a California resident, we’ve faced immense challenges with enrolling her for any form of emergency health insurance or financial support, even with the help of social workers and financial counselors.We’re extremely fortunate that she was able to undergo a partial tumor removal surgery at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. This intensive procedure removed a piece of the tumor that was the size of a hand. Now, she’ll need extensive physical and speech therapy, as well as months ahead of chemotherapy and radiation. If we’re lucky, she’ll be able to qualify for clinical trials. All of these amount to significant out-of-pocket costs. As the only immediate family member besides my sixteen-year-old brother who can speak fluent English and drive, I’ll be my mother’s primary caregiver in the months (and, hopefully, years) to come. I’ve decided to put my dream of attending law school on the backburner because our priority now is to give my mom the best life possible with the best treatment possible. It’s a daunting task, but one that I also consider an honor: to be able to take care of the person who has protected and nurtured us through some of life’s roughest storms. But to be honest, I can’t do this alone. In addition to overseeing my mom’s medical needs, I’ll also be caring for my elderly grandparents, raising my brother and helping him with applying to college in the fall, paying for our living expenses, finishing up classes for my degree, and completing a fellowship.Sometimes, it almost feels like too much. There’s nothing more terrifying than watching the person you love most slowly wither away before your eyes. This last month has been the most challenging time of my life and my biggest fear is that my mom won’t be able to get the care she needs because we can’t afford to foot the medical bill, or don’t have the money to get gas for the car. I’ve spent days writing and rewriting this plea for help. Any amount of support, whether it’s a single dollar or sharing this GoFundMe, would be immensely appreciated by my family.Thank you for helping me give my mom a fighting chance.",1.7k,2.5k,2,"1,708",1 month,17 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is a light in this world that needs our help to shine as bright as she possibly can.Sara’s doctors are recommending 4 concurrent treatments to win this fight. In addition to that, Sara is incorporating treatments that will attack the cancer in a progressive way. All of these treatments will be costly. Sara has some protection in place with a Critical Illness rider on one of her life policies.

The challenges of this have furthered my appreciation for friendship, family, community, and heightened my view of what we do every day to help one another. I will be forever grateful for the thoughtfulness and support I have received. Although it is challenging for me to accept contributions to my recovery, I resolve to pay back this generosity tenfold. If there is one objective in my time left in this world, it will be to give back and inspire.

Medical,15,Viorel Nitica Medical Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/ViorelNiticaMedicalFund,"West Chester, PA","April 15, 2018","$150,000","$63,861","My name is Ana Nitica and I am creating this GoFundMe campaign on behalf of my beloved husband of almost 32 years, Viorel Nitica, at the urging of our family, friends, colleagues, and many people whose lives he has touched.  Viorel has been diagnosed with glioblastoma and the insurance denied coverage for the proton radiation treatment that his doctor prescribed.  Together, we raised two wonderful sons and overcame numerous challenges, some of which were very serious.  Viorel took good care of his family, he enjoyed traveling and the trips at the amazing Longwood Gardens, and working.  Viorel dedicated most of his life to his research and teaching work, contributing a lot to the success of the Department of Mathematics at West Chester University of Pennsylvania where he is a Full Professor of Mathematics with tenure and taught more than 30 different courses.  He is spoken about very highly by his colleagues and students alike.  Viorel authored about 70 research papers, some of them published in prestigious mathematical journals, published two books, participated and gave talks at conferences in many countries, and did reviewer work for many scientific journals. Viorel received two National Science Foundation grants and received the prestigious Trustees Achievement Award from West Chester University.On February 25, 2018, I took Viorel to Chester County hospital because he suffered of headaches during the previous week, which became almost unbearable.  The hospital did a CAT-scan of Viorel’s brain and found a large abnormal deviation in the brain that can cause life threatening intracranial pressure and immediately transported him to the University of Pennsylvania Hospital for more testing and treatment. MRI tests revealed a tumor of diameter between 5 and 6 cm in his brain.On March 1st, more than 95 percent of the tumor was removed, and the surgeon found that it is was glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of malignant brain tumor. We were in shock and took a long time for this to sink in.  The statistics for this are very gloomy, and we proceeded to learned more about it.  In addition to surgery, the treatment also requires radiation and chemotherapy that reduce the chance for a recurrent tumor, which is high.  Even more shocking was the news that because of the size of his tumor and the location, and the nature of the radiation (photon therapy), the treatment would likely leave him disabled in many ways, by damaging his vision, his hearing and his motor function; he may not be able to continue his lifelong passions teaching and research.We asked if something better is available and we were happy to learn that University of Pennsylvania Hospital also performs proton therapy.  The difference is quite remarkable.  Photon therapy (gamma rays, the most powerful electromagnetic radiation, more energetic than x-rays) goes into the tumor and through the brain, depositing energy along the beam path as photons pass through the target and then through an exit point out of the head through the other hemisphere, causing damage to healthy brain along the way.  In contrast, proton therapy deposits the bulk of the energy at the tumor site without affecting the surrounding normal brain.  Because of this, it allows for delivery of a higher dose of radiation without scatter and damage to the surrounding normal tissues in the brain, and thus causing far fewer side effects.  Doing the proton therapy along with chemotherapy will likely allow Viorel to return to his work to be a productive member of society and maintain a certain quality of life that he would lose otherwise.  Getting the proton therapy for Viorel’s tumor seemed to us like a “no-brainer” and the only appropriate course for him to take, and the doctor recommended it.  He said it would be the best thing for my husband, but it is much more expensive than photon radiation and getting the insurance to pay for it would be difficult.  We thought that we have very good insurance through the University and we decided to go for it.  We felt truly blessed to be close to the University of Pennsylvania and to such a wonderful team of doctors, and we are so grateful to them.  They made a solid treatment plan for Viorel.  The surgery and the recovery went well.  We were eager to start the next phase of his treatment.  We thought that the insurance company would surely support us when we are hit so hard.  Little did we know the harrowing journey one has to go through in the quest of getting appropriate care.  The insurance companies are for-profit institutions and to make those booming profits they do not want to pay for the most expensive treatments if they can get away with it.  So, the doctor requested proton therapy for Viorel’s glioblastoma (to preserve his neurocognitive function and spare him the horrendous side effects) and the request was denied.  The appeals to the insurance, accompanied by a letter of medical necessity from the doctor, were rejected.  Basically, it turned out that the insurance we get from the University is not on our side after all.  They would not pay for the protons when they can pay for a cheaper alternative.  The treatments with radiation and chemotherapy must start as soon as one heals after surgery.  There is no time to waste since the tumor can grow again, very fast.  We put half of the cost of the proton treatment on credit cards and we have 5 months to pay for the other half, and Viorel started the proton therapy on April 3 along with chemotherapy.  Viorel also changed his diet drastically and I am doing it along with him. The treatments are rough on him, but he is doing it and I still managed to catch him smile occasionally.  Viorel loves life and he is fighting for it.  We asked for help from the university and we will continue to do whatever we can to get the insurance to pay for the treatment.  We hope the insurance and the university will come through.  These payments put a huge burden on us and they cause us to fear for our financial future.  When we are so down and face death in the face, we feel the insurance and the university should be there for us.  Instead, they put us through an enormous amount of stress.  We still hope that eventually they will do the right thing.  The new proton guidelines recommend proton therapy for intracranial tumors.  We hope they will update their proton policies and pay for the treatment for Viorel.  But we can’t wait for years, and we can’t count on it.  The financial burden would snowball and overwhelm us.  We found out that so many people care about Viorel and would like to help us.  Viorel is not a person who expresses his feelings and emotions often (even though this changed a bit because of the brain tumor), but he is an amazing human being who loves his family and friends and he contributed so much to mathematics and positively touched the lives of so many students.  In his moment of need, many people who know Viorel expressed the wish to contribute and ease his financial burden on this new journey.  We are so grateful for their generosity and I am setting up this funding campaign to make it possible for people to help.  We need to raise about $150,000 at this time to cover the therapy and other expenses.   Extra money raised, possibly if the insurance reimburses us, will be used to cover related expenses that will show up in the future and Viorel will create a fund at the university to help students and others in their moment of need.  Thank you all for the kindness and support you have shown us and for the help you are willing to give us to help lighten our burden during this extremely difficult time.  Thank you for being here for us.  Thank you for your love and prayers.  Thank you.Ana (Magda)",279,278,10,283,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The results were encouraging, but the road was daunting. Adam spent 3 weeks at Good Samaritan Hospital and another 4 weeks recovering at St. Anthony’s Rehab. It was rough going—painful, frightening and humbling as Adam learned to walk again and gain enough functionality to return home and then endure months of radiation of the brain and spine. #fortitudeThrough 2017 Adam had repeated MRIs showing no new growth and Adam went back to his menschy ways without wasting any time—launching a new joint replacement company, spending time with Robin and helping everyone he could. #everydayisagiftBattle #2: Fast forward to Spring of 2018 when Adam faced an abrupt decline and shockingly learned he needed to endure another surgery to debulk the tumor compressing his spine and go back down the long road of surgery, rehab and recovery. Life got worse for Adam with a few frightening seizure episodes that appear as strokes and additional setbacks, which delayed and depleted his inpatient rehab. #shit As of Aug 12th, Adam has rinsed, washed and repeated this painful, debilitating cycle of surgery –> hospitalization –> rehab. Now, after three months of being under the fluorescent glow of a medical facility Adam is home again. Adam is making slow and steady progress reclaiming his self sufficiency with the support of the amazing team at Craig Hospital where they specialize in recovery from spinal injury. With every PT session, Adam get's a bit stronger. #progress Prognosis: During the most recent surgery the tumor was deeply entangled in the spinal column but the surgeons were able to resect nearly 100%. This very invasive surgery has caused injury to the spine leaving Adam currently unable to walk, and managing significant pain. Adam is doing intensive PT every day and the next 6 to 9 months will reveal how much lower body mobility will be recovered. #toughgoing What now?  For now, Adam is home, enjoying being with Robin and his father Len, considering his professional options, receiving outpatient Physical and Occupational Therapy and doing an excellent job being his guru-ish optimistic self. Adam currently requires a lot of support at home and he and Robin are looking into homecare to make life manageable which unfortunately is not covered by insurance.  Adam is the guy who worked as hard as he could on whatever project he was running, whatever event helped his community.

Immediately after learning about the tumor, Lucio, received 8 cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery in a period of 4 months.In Cyprus, they did not have the technology to continue with his treatment so we went to Berlin, Germany, hospital Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum. In Germany, we have done more chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant, and 5 cycles of immunotherapy.After a year of a successful treatment, there is still a 50%-60% chance for the cancer to come back, especially the first 2 years.Knowing this, we have contacted Dr Giselle Sholler of Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital in Michigan. She is doing medical studies to decrease the remission percentile of high risk neuroblastoma. This medical trial is bringing great hope to families like ours.

Medical,15,Keep Jack Walking,https://www.gofundme.com/keep-jack-walking,"NEWARK, OH","March 25, 2018","$50,000","$57,525","It has taken Jack 8 years, but he can now walk with canes, even though he cannot feel below the waist. Although he has overcome so much, the tumor in his spine caused scoliosis. Since birth his spine has progressed to a curve of 60 degrees. This is causing health issues and must be corrected. The standard procedure, covered by insurance,  to correct scoliosis in spinal cord injury children is to put ""magic rods"" in them until they are old enough to have their spine fused. The metal rods will restrict movement, making movement and basic life tasks even more difficult for someone with a SCI.  The rods replacement procedure is irreversible and prevents any benefits from future medical advances. It also will only correct his spine by 20 degrees.As a parent, I decided that I couldn't do this to my child. I knew there had to be another way. I researched, traveled to 3 different states/doctors. The first two doctors had the same suggestion, to put magic rods in him. They also told me there is a high probability he won't walk after the surgery because it will restrict his movement, which he needs for the leg weakness. The doctor in NYC also told me that he would prefer I do it closer to home, even though he has done the most of these surgeries (43) because the rods will likely results in complications, including painful brakes of the rods, requiring surgical corrections. So basically put the rods in to stop the spine from curving, but you are now going to deal with lots of complications and he won't be able to walk. The third doctor from the Institute for Spine and Scoliosis in New Jersey agreed that the rods would be terrible for Jackson. Thus, Dr. Betz and his team in New Jersey would do a surgery that uses a cord similar to a bungee cord to correct his spine. It also allows him to move his body, so he can continue to walk, and it is not permanent. The complications are minimal. After hearing about this unprecedented surgery, and talking to other families that have had this done, we were elated and should have known that it was too good to be true. A month ago they called to tell use our portion of the surgery, $50,000.00. We cannot even make an appointment for the surgery until we put $30,000.00 down. They do not participate with any insurance companies, so this amount is set. At this point we feel completely overwhelmed. I cannot put the rods in Jack and tell him that all of his hard work is for nothing, because this surgery isn't covered by our insurance. Asking for help is very difficult for me, and we have always managed to pay for his medical/travel bills to his appointments across the east coast. Everything that has come our way we have managed to figure it out. I have applied for grants, written letters to everyone who is involved with SCI that could possibly help, and I am continually turned down. $50,000.00 is beyond what we are capable of and are hoping that we can get some help to pay for this surgery for Jack. If you are able to donate we truly appreciate it, and if you are unable I understand too.",248,941,6,246,5 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Medical,16,Help Prakash fight Glioblastoma,https://www.gofundme.com/help-prakash-fight-glioblastoma,"LONGMONT, CO","June 30, 2018","$60,000","$56,647","Hi Everyone,I was diagnosed with Glioblastoma Multiforme  - the most aggressive form of Brain Tumor there is in November of 2016. I have chronicled in detail the journey since then at  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/02/the-story-so-far.html and subsequent blog posts.Very recently, on June 20th, 2018, we were told from an MRI report that the tumor is back in a different part of the brain:   http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/the-monster-rears-its-ugly-head.htmlThe tumor recurrence needs a brain surgery to be done in the next few weeks as surgery is the first line of defense against the tumor. Consequently, I will be unable to work and earn my living for a few weeks in the next couple of months.Things have become even more difficult for me and my family as I got into an unfortunate accident resulting in a couple of broken leg bones last weekend:  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/a-moments-bad-judgment-leads-to-serious.html

As I have explained in this 5-minute video at Ignite Boulder recently, tumor recurrence is a highly likely possibility for a Glioblastoma patient, and multiple tumor recurrences over a few years - each of which will need a brain surgery to address - is likely to kill the patient in a few years. There is room for hope despite this dire prognosis as innovative and effective treatments are being investigated to cure/handle this terminal brain cancer. Most notably, Duke University announced on Tuesday, June 26, 2018, about the impressive results they have observed from the Poliovirus Therapy Treatment in Phase 1 clinical trial. I am seriously investigating the possibility of me enrolling in this treatment at Duke University in the very near future.   http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/06/getting-serious-about-moving-to-durham.html Also, hoping for more innovative and effective treatments to come along in the near future to further expected lifespan while dealing with Glioblastoma.I am starting this fund-raiser to help me deal with Glioblastoma as effectively as possible while continuing to live as normal a life as possible.Even while I was in full-health before the brain surgery and terminal cancer diagnosis, I was having difficulty making ends meet as a freelance Ruby on Rails Developer. This problem has been worsened since the surgery in November of 2016, with ongoing treatments, physical and mental limitations from surgery and treatments, lack of a stable income/disability insurance to cover for expenses while I was not able to work/find work, and other factors. The situation has worsened even further since early 2018 because of increased costs of living - increased healthcare premiums, increased rents, increased expenses for support and  unconventional treatments (supplements, diet changes, running marathons, counseling, etc.)Almost every month since the original surgery in November 2016, I have faced a huge gap between my monthly income and the monthly expenses. I have been addressing these gaps with various strategies as follows:* Start a fund-raiser: I had one fund-raiser last year and got a very encouraging response from my friends, family, and well-wishers in the numerous communities I have been fortunate to have been part of.* Avoid/postpone paying bills: A big item in this category is my tax-filing for 2017. I filed for an extension and have not yet paid the taxes due for last financial year. Expecting the bill with penalties to be in the $15,000 range.* Withdraw from my retirement savings account:  Earlier in March of this year,  my bank balance was close to zero and I decided to clean out my retirement savings account instead of making it a habit of starting fundraisers on an annual basis.  http://www.braincancerchronicle.com/2018/03/time-for-another-fund-raiser-to-help-me.html* Charge everything to a Credit Card: There have been many big bills coming my way in the recent past from the treatments, as well as my wife's USMLE preparation work. Since all these expenses are unavoidable, I have been charging them to my credit cards. Consequently, I have raised a total of around $30,000 on credit card debts - $16,0000 on personal credit cards and $14,000 on a business credit card.* Reach out to close friends for private donations: In the last couple of months, 7 of my friends have helped me out to a tune of $7,000 through private donations with my financial situation.In addition to outlasting terminal cancer, I want to turn myself into a writer as I have been mulling around three memoir ideas:1. Years 1 & 2 with terminal cancer: A chronicle of my journey with Glioblastoma since the initial diagnosis to surviving the first two years. Hoping to write a short, inspirational and educative tome on this topic.2. How I turned myself from a 5-hour-marathoner to a 2.5-hour-marathoner and qualified for Boston Marathon as a middle-aged-man: Qualifying for Boston Marathon has been an inspirational goal for me for the past decade or so. I hope I will be able to turn myself from my current ability to finish marathons in 5 hours time-range to be able to finish in half that time, and document the process along the way in this memoir.3. Dear Aisiri - A letter to my 4 year-old-daughter: I hope to be around through my daughter's childhood, growing up to be a strong and independent woman, and become a parent herself. If Glioblastoma were to make that impossible and force my daughter to grow up without a father during her important formative years, I hope to leave behind a document that she can fall back on for inspiration and hope in the years to come. Any help you provide through this fund-raiser will go a long way in helping me and my family deal with Glioblastoma with a very positive attitude and increase our chances of outlasting this monster.

He had been living there for only a few weeks as part of his summer internship. The roommates immediately called an ambulance and Ishan was admitted to El Camino Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU).The seizures continued without mercy for the next several days, yet Ishan still showed signs of life. He required intubation for 4 days but miraculously regained consciousness on the 4th day and demonstrated gradual recovery, both in speech and cognition as the days progressed. Unfortunately, an MRI scan discovered a tumor in Ishan’s brain that now requires an immediate surgery, as recommended by his doctors. It is not known yet if the tumor is cancer.Ishan had received the only full-ride scholarship to a Nepali student offered by MIT every year, and had moved to the US in August 2017. A brilliant, kind-hearted, and promising student from Nepal, Ishan now faces financial challenges during and after the surgery-- months, if not years after. His family back in Nepal is already facing financial hardships as Ishan's father-- the family's breadwinner,  just flew over to the US (on August 4th) to provide Ishan additional long-term support, leaving his business on hold. Ishan's health insurance covers his medical expenses. However, living expenses for him and his father,  immigration costs for his father's continued stay until his recovery, and many other expenses during his time of recovery are the areas of financial worry. Upon speaking with people in prior similar situations, we anticipate a significant financial burden on Ishan and his family, in addition to the physical, emotional and psychological challenges. We are friends of Ishan and we are setting up this fundraiser requesting any financial support that you can afford, with the aim to lessen the financial burden from his family. Thank you very much in advance for your generous support!P.s. We plan on being fully transparent about all the incoming funds and incurred medical expenses, as endorsed by Sewa International volunteers.

Y hasta la fecha su cuenta de hospital está en 6,704.07 USD. Estos fondos son necesarios de manera urgente ya que Adrián no puede viajar de vuelta a Ecuador donde los costos medicos son menores.Lo recaudado ayudará a Adrián a pagar su cirugia y a su madre a viajar a Singapur desde Ecuador. El es un artista independiente de mucha promesa y por su trabajo artístico ha ganado premios nacionales e internacionales y ha participado en varias exposiciones y residencias artísticas alrededor del mundo.

They were excited about celebrating their 31st wedding anniversary on May 16th, but unfortunately Johnny suffered a serious stroke the day before, on the 15th. He was airlifted to a hospital in San Jose, Costa Rica.  On Friday, May 18th, Johnny’s condition took a turn for the worse as pressure began developing on his brain, leading to an emergency Craniectomy.  He is currently in the ICU under heavy sedation, but stable.  While we do not yet understand the full recovery process facing Johnny, it is clear that he will be recovering in Costa Rica for at least several more weeks. Hopefully, the various insurance plans the Core's have will cover the majority of direct medical costs.  Yet, it is quite evident that numerous indirect costs are going to quickly accumulate to a significant level.  We are trying to provide the family with the funds to allow Gail and other family members to be at Johnny's bedside during the recovery process.  These initial funds will be used for Airfare, Room & Boarding, taxis etc. for family, and for  medical transport fees back to the US, and to  help prepare for his recovery process once he gets home.This Go Fund Me page is being created by the friends of the Johnny Core Family. Johnny & Gail have showered many of us with their love and support in the past and now we have an opportunity to return some of this love and support to them while they go through a difficult time. Currently many thoughts, prayers and gifts have made their way to Johnny & his family, and we need to build on this momentum.For the past week many of us have been struggling to find a way to support the Core's while they are so far away.  In lieu of flowers or food, we ask that you consider this as an option of showing them support.  As always your continued prayers are most important!Thank you & God bless!",412,1.0k,13,403,3 months,2 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

But our sweet 10 year old will have a journey ahead of him.  He will have to endure chemo for three months which includes 10+ day stays in the hospital for each round. B cell lymphoma can be difficult to diagnose and also likes to spread so although we are grateful that his survival rate is near 100%, Nate has already started the hard work of receiving chemo through a port in his chest and also through his spine with several spinal taps to ensure there is no spread of disease. Not only does he have a long road ahead of him, this will also take him away from his home and his twin brothers Derek and Kyle, incoming 4th graders, for the summer. Nate loves summer and everything that goes along with it, some of his favorites things to do are play golf, fish and swim. However his treatments will take him away from these activities this summer, along with missing the time with his brothers.  Nate is also a boy with special needs which makes his treatment more difficult as it is hard for him to understand the things he's being asked, both physically and emotionally and also hard for him to explain all the feelings he is having.Nate’s FamilyIf you know his parents, Eric and Jenna, you know they don't ask anyone for much help. These past several weeks have been very hard on them trying to manage a household and three boys while one is in the hospital. Eric is self-employed and has put his work load aside to be with Nate.  Jenna works at a preschool and may not be able to go back to work in the fall as Nate cannot get sick because of a compromised immune system. Nate’s amazing parents have not left his side and will continue to be with him on this journey.  As medical bills come in and other things arise (i.e., babysitters, last minute care for the twins, cancelled summer vacations, etc.) this gofundme has been set up for Nate's care and anything that he could potentially need now and in the future as he battles to make cancer a memory! If you can donate, great! If you cannot please #prayforNate!Faith, Family, FriendsWe are so very thankful for the wonderful village of family and friends that Nate has surrounding him to help make this unfortunate time easier to deal with. Receiving care at Maria Fareri Children's Hospital in Valhalla means that the family is close to home and can be surrounded by their tribe at this difficult time. Meals, laundry, carting the twins to camp and offers to hang with us and Nate have been overwhelming. We truly believe in the power of prayer and ask that you continue to #prayforNate as time goes on and his family can adjust to this new normal. We know that God has a plan for us and any funds not needed for Nate will find their way to other kids fighting cancer battles all over.",368,993,26,369,1 month,18 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Their son Winston, 21 months, a rough n’ tumble, joyful toddler with an infectious laugh and a giving nature for a kid so young, was diagnosed with a kidney cancer called Wilms Tumor. A malignant growth the size of a baseball covered his right kidney. Two days later, Winston underwent a nephrectomy (the removal of the kidney) in the hopes that the tumor was encapsulated and that all of the cancer would be eradicated.Heartbreakingly, Winston’s team discovered that Winston’s cancer is Stage 3, having spread to his lymph nodes. He is now undergoing a rigorous six-month course of chemotherapy and radiation. To make matters way worse,  Brian’s employer National Grid locked out all of their workers and stopped paying the company portion of their health insurance even after his union offered to continue working with the old contract until their new contract was negotiated.(You might have seen the interview Brian did about the situation in the video above, which was also covered in a segment by WCVB here in Boston.)There are so many unknowns both emotionally and financially when it comes to cancer treatment and disease management. The Harveys are the kind of couple who’ve both been working hard since they were teenagers. They’re the type of people who go above and beyond when their family and friends are in need.  So I started this GoFundMe to help them in their time of need with Winston’s medical costs during treatment. Winston has been given excellent chances for a full recovery by his oncology team. So, if you’re reading this, please give what you can to reach our goal in helping him return to staging toy dinosaur battles on his daddy’s head and gleefully fist-bumping with everyone in the room.  And if you can’t, positive thoughts or a prayer or two are more than welcome.

Kevin and his young family's lives  have changed drastically. Unfortunately, Kevin will need 24/7 care. Laura, Kevin's wife, will be caring for him and had to leave her job.       Kevin was in the ICU for 3 weeks and was hospitalized for a total of 58 days. Kevin suffered strokes, seizures, brian damage and was in and out of AFIB. Doctors didn't think Kevin would be able to walk, eat, or follow simple commands ever again. Kevin laid lifeless in his hospital bed for several weeks only responding to pain. With help from his loving wife, family, friends, FDNY members/Doctors, Columbia doctors, ORMC Doctors, and the Helen Hayes staff, Kevin is making some progress. Unfortunately Kevin has months, maybe years of rehabilitation ahead of him. Anyone that knows Kevin, knows he won't give up this fight.   Kevin now suffers from Aphasia and Apraxia which effects his motor planning and speech. Kevin struggles with simple tasks we all take for granted.    Kevin has been a dedicated FDNY firefighter for 15 years.

As he had just turned five, his yearly check up was a few days away. Sophy and Michael brought their concerns to the primary care doctor. The doctor wasn't too concerned and sent them on their way to an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist felt it was a virus that may have effected the cranial nerve. To err on the side of caution the ophthalmologist sent Ori for an MRI to rule out anything else. Ori's MRI was on Monday July 24th and on Tuesday the 25th the Singer's lives took a turn that is a families worst nightmare. As Sophy and Michael sat down with the neuro-oncologyst and various other doctors they learned that Ori has a tumor in his brain stem. The doctors refer to this as pediatric glioma in the brain stem. If you don't already know, the brain stem controls almost everything: swallowing, seeing, breathing, and beyond. Ori's tumor is in his brain stem and is inoperable. Immediately Sophy and Michael were on the phone with multiple doctors, friends and family members to determine next steps. They were able to schedule a biopsy for one week later and an additional MRI. On Tuesday July 31st Ori was put under general anesthesia and underwent a biopsy where a robot went through his nose and into his brain-stem. The surgeon was able to get what he needed. With the biopsy has come many set backs for Ori and the Singer family. Due to edema from the procedure and the sensitivity of the brain stem Ori has since been unable to swallow, is slurring his speech, and is having a hard time smiling and using the muscles in his mouth. In addition he is having some respiratory set backs with his oxygen levels and coughing throughout his day. As of last night, Wednesday, Ori was moved from the ICU to another room. The neuro-oncologist shared that Ori would need time and rehab to strengthen the muscles that support his speech and swallowing. Lastly he received an NG tube which goes through his nose and delivers food into his stomach. The goal is to fill Ori with nutrients as he is re-learning to swallow. Within the next 2 weeks the Singer family will learn the results of the biopsy and a treatment plan will be determined. There has been such beautiful outpouring of love and support from friends, family and the community and the Singer family is very grateful. The purpose of this Gofundme page is to raise enough money so that Sophy can take 1-2 months off from work to focus on Ori's next steps while also caring for Sasha, Ori's twin sister.  Sasha has visited Ori in the hospital. At this time she knows that Ori has a boo boo on his brain and he has a special tube in his nose to help him eat while he is learning to swallow again. Its hard to believe how quickly one's life can change. Please consider contributing to the Singer family.With so much love, gratitude and sincere appreciation.Kim, Carlsbad CA",470,1.3k,7,472,1 month,21 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

For the last eight years, the Gooleys have spent much of their time in emergency rooms and doctor’s offices, searching for answers and praying for healing. As doctors began to manage the initial diagnosis, another came: Vasculitis in the form Bechet's Syndrome . On top of his diagnoses, he’s battled recurring pneumonia, sepsis and had two heart attacks. And the last nine months have been the hardest of all. Tim missed his brother’s funeral, his eldest son’s wedding, a son’s law school graduation and a family trip to California. He received a third diagnosis, mycobacterium (MAC), broke his right hip and was left bedridden after an emergency knee replacement four weeks ago.On April 15, 2018 after a severe vasculitis flare left him hospitalized and delirious from the pain, Tim was airlifted to the Cleveland Clinic to give specialists another shot at treating him.Throughout this journey, family members, the community and their church stepped up, offering prayers and everyday support, as Joni split her time between caring for Tim, raising the three youngest children and working full time as the guidance counselor at Lake Park Elementary.

A little bit about Ezana: Ezana Goitom is 45-years old, the son of Neguest Menguesha and Goitom Gide, youngest brother of Ephrem, Issayas, Zebad, Aster and Azeb Goitom.  Like all his siblings, Ezana went to Lycée Gebremariam French School in Addis Ababa, before emigrating to the US in early 90's.His medical condition:Our brother Ezana Goitom Gide sustained a spinal cord injury and has been diagnosed with Central Cord Syndrome.  He is now quadriplegic, bed bound, unable to move his extremities.  Ezana is oxygen dependent with a tracheostomy to breath.  He has a speaking valve that allows him to speak.For the past seven  months, he has been to different hospitals due to many health complications and problems.   After many ups and downs, two steps forward one step back, he is currently preparing for an acute rehabilitation.Based on the overall assessment of the Doctors, we are realistic in recognizing that he will not regain his motor skills and now, we are gearing towards planning his future accordingly.This is where we are making this humble appeal to our family and friends for help.  The road is long and we are turning for your help to alleviate some of the financial burden we are facing. This experience has made us all reflect in the preciousness of life.   We are constantly reminded to do our due diligence by Ezana’slove, smile, sense of humor, his courage in his acceptance of his condition and yet with optimism in a future where he sees himself being productive and independent.  Ezana says the outpouring of love and support received during these past seven months from family and friends inspires him to endure with hope and sanity, as we, in turn, are inspired by his attitude to do all we can to help him.   His medical condition should not be an impediment to living life to its fullest and to being productive – the mind is too precious not to fight for.We would like to thank all our friends and family members who have been with us during this difficult time and words fail us to express how grateful we are for the love and support you’ve shown us.  May God reward you a thousand fold! Zebad, Ephrem, Ezana , Azeb and Aster in Neuro-ICUWhere your money goes: Ezana needs  an acute rehabilitation.  In order to be admitted to a rehabilitation center, he will need a discharge plan to a safe living space for his condition.  This means that he has to have a place in Washington, D.C., which is approved by the American Disability Act.  We are currently looking for suitable apartments close to the rehabilitation center until we find one through government help in the long term.Although he may be eligible to receive 12 to 18 hours of home aide per day, his current medical status requires 24 hours skilled nursing care per day for which he will need to pay out of pocket.In addition, the equipment needed to alleviate his situation is costly.   Since he is unable to use his limbs, he will need a computer to be operated with his eyes/voice and a motorized wheelchair to be monitored with his head. Also, in order for us, the family, to move him around from home to an out patient acute rehabilitation, we will need a handicapped friendly van. It is a humbling experience to ask for funds, however life is too sacred not to fight for it.Please stand with us and help us know we’re not alone. Again, thank you so much for all that you’ve done for us.   It is in the support that we’ve received thus far that we found the courage to make this appeal.Ezana with his mother",400,3.0k,3,398,3 months,1 day ago,-1,2018-09-03

A small mole on his shoulder began to change. It was removed and showed to be cancer. It grew back very aggressively and had already spread to his liver and spleen.He flew to Canada to begin treatment but his body kept rejecting the medicine and he became sicker and sicker.The cancer then spread to his lungs. He came back to Los Angeles in December to begin a cutting-edge cancer treatment trial at the Beverly Hills Cancer Clinic.It was then discovered that the cancer had spread to his brain. He immediately began 2 weeks of brain radiation. The results of the radiation are being monitored now to see how successful it has been.He is receiving long-term treatment to try to arrest the growth of the cancer and stop it from spreading further.The treatment is immunotherapy, radiation and T-Vec. Now his insurance company in the US has stopped approving his T-Vec injections. They’re also taking weeks/months to approve immunotherapy treatment, scans and basic care that is imperative to Mark’s recovery. It’s dangerous because Mark has Stage 4 Melanoma and it is a highly aggressive form which has shown to spread and metastasize very rapidly. He has flown back to Canada to try to get the medication and treatment that he needs with cancer specialist, Marcus Butler at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto, who is one of the leading Melanoma specialists in North America. He needs to be in a little apartment in Toronto where he can be close to his doctors and the cancer clinic. We need to raise enough money to pay his rent, bills and living expenses for a year or two. This will give him the time to finish treatment and regain his health and beat this.He has been unable to work since he was diagnosed and has no form of income. We need Mark Howard in the world, not only because he is an amazing father and friend but for the music he is yet to give us… Put on “Time Out Of Mind,” “World Without Tears,” “Wrecking Ball” and think of Mark and then donate.

As my treatment has continued forth, it has reached a point where my treatment team is recommending the need for additional treatment. After undergoing the 5th regimen of chemo, I have begun seeking out consults from multiple major universities and hospitals throughout the state.  After no additional clinical trials or treatment options have been found here in Florida, the search has begun to be explored outside the state. The Lord has opened a door in Houston, Texas at MD Anderson. I was contacted last week and was told I was a candidate for a study that would be held during the summer and am also eligible for additional treatment options that Florida does not currently have. This of course is an answer to my prayer and a move that is highly recommended from my treatment team. However, with this comes much expense due to the need to having to stay in Houston for the duration of my treatment. Unfortunately this decision has placed me in a very big hardship and in need of additional funding so I can heal. Please pass this on to anyone who knows me or is sympathetic to my cause. Prayers are additionally recommended.",137,319,0,135,5 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Oncologists at Sloan Kettering are aiming to shrink the tumor enough to operate, since it currently touches one artery and is wrapping around another artery. They may also administer another round of chemo and/or radiation following the surgery. As anyone who knows Margo would expect, she is facing this diagnosis with her characteristic tenacity, pragmatism and bravery.  In late June, she said goodbye to her coworkers at Caliper Studios in Bushwick, a job she loves, in order to focus on treatment and healing. John, her husband, and their two kids, Declan (14) and Severine (11) and their dog Lucy, will be by her side in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The coming months are not going to be easy, but the support of friends and family will make all the difference. We are asking you to be as generous as you can in Margo’s time of need.All money will go directly to Margo and her family. Funds will help offset her loss of income, medical expenses not covered by insurance, and the many other outlays of money necessary to provide comfort to her as she fights cancer and recovers from this overwhelming ordeal.No donation is too small, and anything you can contribute will make a difference. She and her family are already very grateful for the support they’ve received in the wake of this diagnosis. Margo has started a blog on CaringBridge.com. You can read it here:  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/margogibsonWe will also have a fundraising event for Margo after her surgery in the fall, where some of her favorite local bands and DJs will perform.

A failed deck railing collapsed, and after falling 15 ft, he landed on his back.  A T8-T9 spinal fracture occurred, leaving Jeff with no feeling in or control over anything below his upper abdomen. We are unsure if a portion of his paralysis is temporary, or if this will be a permanent reality for him, but for now, Jeff will live life as a paraplegic.We’ve had so many people reach out to us, so we’ve created this GoFundMe for those who want to help.One of the biggest hurdles Jeff and his family will face moving forward is the struggle of regaining the quality of life they once had. We would be incredibly grateful for any financial support you can offer to make this happen. The expenses are sure to stack up quickly; current and future medical bills, wheelchairs, wheelchair ramps, widening doors, modifying bathrooms/kitchens, wheelchair lifts for stairs, a new car that can accommodate a disabled driver are all priorities, but they only represent a portion of the financial burden his family will be bearing during his recovery.Please, be generous. Help Jeff and his family maintain the quality of life they’ve worked so hard to build. Your support is appreciated more than you can know. We love you and thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We will leave off with a message that Jeff wants you to hear:“Every single one of you reading this needs to go hug and kiss your family, right now, at least electronically if physically isn’t an option.  Because you never know when your life will change so suddenly and so violently and so permanently...”“Stop fighting over nonsense that doesn’t matter.  Stop hating on people who think differently than you. Stop working so much. Stop, for a moment, and consider the possibility that you may not be right, and that there may not BE a right.”“Instead, go to fun places and do fun things with the ones that you love.

Allen is facing a very uncertain future.  Christy has many tests scheduled and is unable to care for herself.  Allen has medical insurance, but every home visit his insurance will allow comes with a co-pay.  That could be $75/per day alone.  Additionally, if he has to take leave without pay, he will have to pay part, and very soon all, all of his medical premiums at almost $1,000/month.  Allen did not want to ask for help, but his brother-in-law who is also a deputy reached out to us at their Association and asked for help.  We are trying to coordinate a donation of hours, but our county requires employees to jump through almost insurmountable hoops to get there.  Therefore, we need to reach out and ask for any assistance you can give.  The family is under a tremendous amount of stress coupled with the unknown as Christy continues to rapidly deteriorate with no diagnosis.    Every penny donated will go directly to Allen to help defray any costs and pay the bills.  He is tremendously worried about feeding his children over the coming months and we ask you to help relieve some of that stress so that he can focus on taking care of his wife and children.  Thank you very much!Below is what I asked Allen to write up for this campaign.  I am so touched by their love story and hope that you are also.  From Allen:  Christy and I met when she moved in across the street from me.  I was 17 and she was 16 at the time in 1988.  We started dating and dated for six years before deciding to marry in 1994.  We had our first child Bradley in 2003, Second child Tyler 2006, and third child Ian 2010.  We purchased our first house in 1998 and are still there to this date.  Our son Bradley started having medical issues around 2014 which created numerous trips to several different doctors, time off work, and extra medical expenses.  Bradley was diagnosed with Systemic Lupus almost a year later.  In July 2017, we started to notice Christy having difficulty performing routine daily tasks.  Christy started seeing doctors about her condition in July 2017 and was then sent to the specialists at USC for further evaluation.  It has been determined Christy has a brain disorder that has yet to be diagnosed.  At this point in time Christy cannot walk without assistance, care for our three boys, and cannot be left alone due to her high fall risk.  I have depleted my vacation / comp banks to tend to the needs of my wife and son and expect there to be large medical bills soon.  Any money donated will be used only for medical and household necessities.",414,1.2k,3,416,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

As many of you know Ann Marie has received quite a tough diagnosis and needs our help. On June 18, on her birthday no less, she was given a diagnosis of a rare aggressive throat cancer.Because of the severity and aggressiveness of the cancer, laryngectomy surgery is scheduled next week (July 3, 2018) at Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston. In order to get all of the cancer, they will completely remove her larynx (voice box), and lymphnodes; she will loose her ability to speak. She will need to learn how to breathe, talk and eat in a new way. Post surgery she will be in the ICU for 48 hours and then will remain in the hospital for 7 - 10 days. She won’t be able to eat through her mouth and will use a feeding tube until while her throat heals. She will learn to use a temporary device to communicate (Electrolarynx) in a new way and begin the long process of recovery. Once discharged from the hospital she will require homecare support and nursing to help with the healing process. She will be home 4-6 weeks attending to the care of her stoma, other medical issues and medical appointments. Once the site has healed a Voice Prosthesis (TE- Tracheoesophageal) will be placed at that time which is the gold standard in voice restoration. At that time she will learn esophageal speech. When recommended by her Dr’s, she will receive 35 days of Radiation along with a combination of Chemotherapy.  She needs our help with funding: ·       Purchasing and maintenance of laryngectomy equipment which is not covered by insurance -remember this is for the rest of her life. ·       Purchasing ongoing Voice Assistive technology speaking equipment so she can communicate with health care workers, family, friends, colleagues, clients and patients. Her goal is to return to her private practice when she is strong enough. ·        She will need extensive speech rehabilitation, medication and additional therapies to help her stay strong. All of these services will be capped by insurance and will require out of pocket monies to cover. Again, this is for the rest of her life. ·       Home services not covered by insurance for ongoing care (Private Nursing, Speech, etc.)·       Deductibles from insurance·       Loss of income – which covers her health insurance, medical expenses, and ongoing home expenses, and private practice expenses.  Any monies not used in this process will be donated to Dana Faber Cancer Institute for helping larynjectomy patients.  It breaks my heart that Ann Marie will have to go through this.  For those of us who have had the pleasure to work with her, we know what a caring and talented woman she is. Her generosity of spirit, combined with her expertise and wisdom are a rare gift - she is a rare find! As a colleague, she has a wealth of experience to draw upon that has enhanced my knowledge.

It was a Monday and like most Monday’s Brianna didn’t want to get up and go to school. Even 8-year-olds can have a case of the Monday’s now and then, or so my sister had hoped. This Monday turned out to be very different. It was life-altering, heart-stopping, and heartbreaking.My sister is a critical care RN and has had a gut-wrenching feeling for years (6 to be exact) that something was medically going on with Brianna. She, like any good parent, took her daughter Brianna to doctor after doctor looking for answers. She went to a total of 27 specialists over 6 years, each one explaining away Brianna’s weird symptoms and unexplained weight gain. My sister kept thinking all along that Brianna may have a tumor in her pituitary gland and asked for CT scans and MRI's from many physicians over the years. All of the doctors just said the same thing, ""she is just overweight"" blaming her symptoms on her weight. Refusing to do CT scan because “we don’t like to expose children to that much radiation” or ""the insurance is never going to approve an MRI"". All of the doctors were telling her that her daughter's raspy voice, paralysis of the vocal cord, swelling of her head, dizzy spells with nausea were just symptoms of weight gain. Finally, on April 9, 2018, Brianna had another rough morning of dizzy spells and couldn’t get up. My sister took her back to the ER who again, blamed her weight. They told my sister that her dizzy spells were because she is an anxious child, she needs to lose weight and to see a psychologist. My sister refused to leave the ER without a CT scan. Our worst possible nightmare was now a reality. Brianna, in fact, does have a brain tumor.... and because so many years had passed and so many health care providers let my family down, the tumor has had years to grow and spread into her spinal cord. These same doctors, including the ER doctor that day, are calling my family almost daily to tell them how sorry they are and to check on Brianna. We are not trying to put down the health care system, Brianna’s mom is an RN. We want all parents out there to know that frequent hiccups, hoarse voice, body odor at a young age, and dizzy spells are some of her symptoms that are definitely directly related to her tumor. Please do not simply pass them off as no big deal. Brianna is in for the fight of her life and needs her parents and brother to be with her as much as possible. Her mother and father both had to stop working in order to take her to Memphis, TN to Bonheur Children’s Hospital for tumor resection. Here was her best chance to get as much of the tumor out based on size/location and the fact that it spread. Her first 15-hour surgery on April 16, 2018, had complications of blood clots throughout her brain. Then on April 27, 2018, she had to go back to surgery because of fever, leaking of Cerebral Spinal Fluid and intense pain. She now has a brain drain (EVD) and may need a ventricular shunt in the coming weeks. Both her parents were everyday hardworking people, an RN and Journeymen Linemen, just getting by day to day and trying to do the best for their family. Now they both need to be with Brianna as she is extremely ill and as any 8-year-old would need, she needs her parents by her side. So, if you are able to help them in a monetary way in their desperate and darkest time of need, then Thank You from the bottom of our hearts. If you are unable to help monetarily, then please lift up our family in prayer because we need all the thoughts, prayers and love we can get for our family at this time. We pray that you will never have to hear the words the ER doctor told my sister, “I’m sorry, you were right... She has a brain tumor and we have failed her all these years”",888,556,11,923,4 months,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,19,Seth Christmas ,https://www.gofundme.com/sethchristmas,"BRATTLEBORO, VT","April 11, 2018","$50,000","$52,871","Our brother, Seth Christmas, was recently diagnosed with stage four adenocarcinoma. His symptoms started just after Christmas but really triggered around the beginning of March.  Thinking it was just a bad ulcer, his pain began to get progressively worse forcing him to visit a doctor.  After visiting with a gastroenterologist, some blood tests and eventually a CT scan were performed, the tests showed masses in both his chest and abdomen as well as a high white blood cell count.From there, Seth went to Dartmouth Hitchcock for an endoscopy to perform biopsies to see if the masses were in fact cancerous. Having had to wait three weeks to get these results, Courtney took matters into her own hands and got him two appointments at Dana Farber and Brigham and Women's in Boston.    Results from Dartmouth were sent to Boston and it was confirmed yesterday at Dana Farber that all sites tested during the endoscopy are positive.  He has a tumor at the end of his esophagus, spots on his liver as well as enlarged lymph nodes in the chest/abdomen area which are all cancerous.  The thoracic surgeon we met with at Brigham said as of yesterday surgery if off the table and most likely radiation as well, because it was found in multiple locations. After meeting with the oncologists at both Dana and Dartmouth his first form of defense is going to be chemo therapy.  He needs to attack the whole body, not just one concentrated area.  What kind of chemo treatment he will receive is still being determined. Seth is currently working with oncologists at both at Dana Farber and Dartmouth Hitchcock.  With as many experts' minds pooled together, they are going to coordinate and hopefully develop the best treatment plan possible for him.  Chemo will just be the first of many to come!Due to the extreme amount of pain he has been in he has not been able to work.  Once he started receiving medications (which he is still finding the right combination to work for him) he could not return to his place of employment while taking these medications.  He is considered not ""fit for duty"" as they call it in the Nuclear Power Plant world.  So he's had to step down or resign at this point from his job.  With no steady income at the moment and a number of expenses coming in, we are asking for the help of our family and friends.  We can't ease his physical or emotional pains,  but our hope is to relieve some of the financial burdens of this illness.  His focus needs to be on getting himself better and taking care of his adorable three year old son Carter.

We are in such a state of shock. We don’t even know how to fully process this. While on his way home early in the morning, Nate’s car skidded on ice, crashed, and ejected him head first through the windshield.Nate was in the snow for five hours, and his body temperature dropped to 81 degrees before the emergency workers were able to find him. He was life-flighted almost immediately to a hospital in Sioux Falls, where our family rushed to be with him. He has swelling in the brain, but no bleeding as of now. He has broken bones in the lower region of his back, and severely bad road rash across his back. The doctors decided to put Nate in a medically induced coma and hook him up to a ventilator in order to reduce the brain’s swelling and body’s trauma. He is still unable to gain full consciousness as of now, and hasn’t opened his eyes yet, but we are patient for his recovery. Thanks be to God there is hope. Nate’s hands, feet, eyes, and brain are all responsive and moving. His doctors are stunned that he is even alive, but we know how big our God is and what great miracles He gives to us. Now though, we are forced to play an excruciating waiting game while Nate’s body works to heal. We are plagued by doubts and fears, and almost consumed with an anxiousness that ranges from a numbing worry to all-out panic.  We say almost because, although this event is one of the worst kinds of pain for a family, while there is life there is hope. We are surrounded by an unbelievable support system that is praying for us minute by minute. We are so incredibly blessed by all of you, and will be thankful for everyone’s thoughts, prayers, and love forever.Our next step is to make a plan to get Nate home when he wakes up. This means flying him from South Dakota to California while trying to keep him with all the necessary medical care. Our family needs $30,000 to do this. If anyone feels like they are able to donate, even just $5, we would be forever grateful. And if not, we ask from the deepest part of our hearts to please send up a few prayers for Nate, that he would be able to wake up soon. Again, We are so thankful for every one of you, for even taking the time out of your day to read this post. Believe me, your prayers and love are felt every second of the day. We wish all the happiness to you and yours, and hopefully will be able to send a miracle update any hour now.

He has flown with jetBlue for over 14 years. He had opportunities to advance to captain, but he decided to wait for our daughter to finish high school before we relocated.  Craig was instrumental in being a role model to our daughter Rylee, who is currently a student in the Aviation program at Utah Valley University following in his footsteps.   Hurricane Irma welcomed us to Fort Lauderdale when we relocated in September 2017. We took an emergency flight out to Puerto Rico between the two storms. We are so grateful for jetBlue’s compassion and generosity of capping all flights at $99 during that desperate time. Every work flight, I look forward to my love Craig returning home safely. On his last return flight home, the day before father’s day, Craig told me that he had pains in his stomach. When he arrived home, his eyes looked a little yellow.  In the morning, they were bright yellow and his skin was orangish yellow.  On our way to the beach, we made a quick stop at instacare, and surprisingly we were rerouted to the ER.  He was there for 6 days and they found a cancerous tumor in his upper GI tract.  Whipple surgery was scheduled for July 16 to remove the tumor. The surgeons felt this intense surgery would be effective and that his cancer was curable because it was so small. During the three week wait for the surgery, Craig had the most positive, strongest attitude that he would beat this. We enjoyed being together each day, working out, walking on the beach, snorkeling and kayaking to keep his mind off the upcoming surgery.    July 16, 2018 had dual meaning for our family. Our daughter, Rylee, was getting her multi-engine certification and Craig was having major whipple surgery.  At the same time, Rylee was in the air, successfully taking her skills test, and Craig was in a long 8 hour intense surgery. In Craig’s critical surgery parts  of his intestinal tract, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, and the gallbladder were removed.  After surgery, he was not sent to the ICU to be carefully monitored. After 4 short days and still spitting up black bile the hospital still released him to go home. Less than 24 hours later, he became violently ill. I called 911 because he was non responsive and his skin was gray. They rushed him to ER where he aspirated feces bile into his lungs. His heartbeat flatlined. They revived him and put him on  a ventilator - oxygen life support. He has been in critical care ICU for 5 weeks. His perfectly healthy lungs were destroyed, before his body even had time to heal from the surgery. Several chest tubes are in his lungs to drain the excessive fluid. The doctors informed me he needs a lung transplant. The hospital has been contacting hospitals all over the country.  Craig is not qualified as a recipient because his cancer needs to be in remission for 5 years before they would accept him as a transplant recipient. We are searching for other options.  After several brain and body scans, all other organs are fully functioning.  He is fully conscious and aware. He has a strong heart, mind, and soul.  He is loving, kind, young, physically fit and positive.  He is a true friend to everyone!   Currently, I, along with family and friends, are praying for his every breath, literally.  Everyday my time is spent with him. I am reaching out to others, who want to show their love and support for Craig Hellmers needs.   Much Love Tricia  Craig Hellmers, I love you more, we are going to grow old together.",431,589,4,440,12 days,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Eric has been struggling with chronic Lyme disease and other tick-borne infections for the past ten years.Lyme disease is no joke. Symptoms include severe fatigue, brain fog, neurological and arthritic pain, insomnia, and depression.

The longer it goes misdiagnosed, the more difficult it becomes to treat.Eric has been able to work through the discomfort of this debilitating disease until recently. If you know him even a little bit, you know how much he likes to work! Treatment for advanced Lyme is quite expensive and the majority is not covered by his health insurance. Sadly, the Office of Workers Compensation Program (OWCP) is a cumbersome, contentious, and unresolving system that leaves many wildland firefighters with overwhelming medical bills to cover.Erics wife Celine has been elected as the sole beneficiary for funds gathered during the campaign.

There is currently no cure for this dreadful disease, and the standard treatment is radiotherapy simply to extend the child's life. You can read more about DIPG here Over the last 8 weeks, Georgia has undergone 4 MRI's, a brain biopsy and 6 weeks of radiotherapy. At this time, this is all that conventional medicine can do for us. However, there ARE therapies out there. They're experimental in nature, but we've researched them endlessly and identified the ones that show promise. We feel very strongly that we owe it to our little girl to try them. Her quality of life is forefront of our mind, so we won't put her through endless treatments if she is clearly deteriorating. But right now, she's improving, and has such a will to live and a love of life, that we are determined to try and save her. Without trying these treatments, she has just months to live. The first, and perhaps most costly procedure, is she is being fitted with a Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) system. This is a relatively new technique which allows cancer fighting drugs to pass across the 'Blood Brain Barrier', the impenetrable wall that makes treating brain stem cancer so difficult. You can read more about CED here  This procedure is estimated to cost around £60,000.Once fitted, Georgia can receive transfusions of the chemotherapy drugs that show some promise, as well as using immunotherapy treatments to fight the cancer. These infusions will involve travelling every few weeks to Europe, and are estimated to cost between £6,000 and £20,000 per infusion. Our total estimated costs are in the region of £200,000 to £300,000 and are all Out of Pocket. We are draining our savings to fund as much as we can, but still have a shortfall. People have been so kind and generous already but if you can spare anything at all to help Georgia, we would be so incredibly grateful.

I was measuring for a new refrigerator at my house. I remember my right side collapsing, causing me to fall to the floor. It took a half hour to drag myself to my phone. I texted my childhood friend, Anne Tressler, who luckily lives around the corner. Of course she thought I was kidding. I wasn't; I'm not that kind of comic. Once I convinced her I was in real trouble, she sprang into action.


Thanks to the wonderful people at Mercy Hospital, who literally saved my life, I'm able to write this letter.

Medical,20,Help Katie Fight MS,https://www.gofundme.com/help-katie-fight-ms,"BOSTON, MA","May 6, 2018","$60,000","$57,300","This is a long story and I hope you don’t mind, because my family needs your help!      My daughter, Katie Kelly O’Donnell was diagnosed with MS in February of 2016. At the time of this diagnosis, Katie was a mom, a wife, a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a niece, a cousin, a friend, a teacher, an active runner and a traveler.  Katie’s daughter, Áine, was 15 months old.  Shortly after Áine’s birth, Katie started to notice some difficulty with her balance, her memory and word retrieval.  She thought these symptoms were postpartum related or stress after going back to work with a baby.     Fortunately, her primary care doctor listened to her concerns and ordered blood tests and an MRI.  Two days later Katie was told she had pernicious anemia, which is serious low vitamin B levels and often has similar symptoms to MS. This was a big relief for someone who thought she might have brain cancer! Her primary doctor encouraged her to go ahead with the MRI scheduled for 2 days later.  As soon as the radiologist read the report, Katie was sent to the emergency room and was admitted to the MGH neurology floor.       After several more tests, including a lumbar puncture and consultation with many doctors Katie was told the MRI results showed 70 – 90 active liaisons on her brain and her spine.  She had Relapsing Remitting MS (RRMS).  RRMS is consider the best form of MS (if there is such a thing) and many people who have RRMS live full and happy lives.  RRMS is a chronic, disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and the body.       That weekend Katie started to imagine her brain full of crawling snakes like Medusa!     After 4 days of treatment with steroids, Katie went home believing that she would be back to her students the next week.  Her family and doctors kept suggesting she needed more time to allow her brain to recover.     Six weeks later I was with Katie when I noticed her acting strangely and she admitted that she was seeing double.  The ride from Weymouth to MGH was stressful as Katie saw 2 cars instead of 1 and 2 people when I only saw 1!   At the hospital Katie saw disjointed body parts of people walking the hallways.  How do you explain this without sounding crazy?  She was admitted for observation and the new MRI showed more MS activity.  We were in a nice room with a great view of the moon on the Charles River. Katie asked us why the moon was moving, kind of dancing around. We looked at each other with concern and explained that the moon was not moving, it was just hanging in the sky.     Katie is a fighter, she did not give up and she ran a 5K road race the next week with a friend.     At this point, she realized she was not going back to work for a long time.  This was a tough realization.  With this relapse we all realized that this disease was much worse than we originally thought and her doctors told her she had a much more aggressive form of RRMS than they originally thought. This relapse meant Katie was not able to work, take care of her daughter, run by herself, sing the alphabet song, read a book, drive or get out of bed on some days.  She had severe headaches from her forehead to her tailbone.     The doctors started Katie on a new drug, Tysabri.  Tysabri is administered intravenously every 4 weeks at the hospital. This drug seemed to prevent flare ups for a time being, however, the fatigue and pain has never gone away.     In October of 2016, about 7 months after her diagnosis, in pouring rain, Katie and her friend, Kara, ran the BAA ½ marathon and finished without stopping. They promised each other they would not cry along the way.  I was on the side lines with my sister and we cried! When they finished, Katie and Kara allowed themselves to cry.     Katie stayed hopeful and with the help of family and friends who drove her to and from work, prepared meals and looked after Áine, she was able to return to work full time in February of 2017, 1 year after her diagnosis.  She was happy to be working again, but it was exhausting.  Every day when she went home from work, she gave Áine as much attention as she could and went to bed crying, before sun had set. She finished the school year and with the help of her principal, she was able to secure a 3 day a week position for the fall of 2017.      Last month Katie was excited to spend a rare Saturday evening out with friends, playing bingo at the church all.  She sat down and even before taking a sip of a drink, she knew that something was happening in her brain. Two friends helped her out to the car and they drove her to my house because it was closest. One look at her and I knew we had to go the MGH immediately! This was another scary ride to through Boston because Katie could not hold a bottle of water in her hands, she was shaking all over and her jaw started to droop. At the hospital, they originally thought she was having a stroke or a brain aneurysm and she got plenty of attention.  These were quickly ruled out we breathed a sigh of relief, but it was MS. She was admitted again, was given high doses of steroids, was released the next day and missed 1 week of work.  Since this relapse, the fatigue is worse, her memory is worse, her word retrieval is worse and her debilitating headaches are worse.       We decided to look for other treatments. The only treatment shown in clinical trials to be effective at halting the progression of RRMS is hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). In addition to halting MS progression, some patients experience reversal of symptoms. This treatment uses high doses of chemotherapy to wipe out the immune system, and then the patient’s own bone marrow stem cells are transplanted back in the body to help rebuild an immune system with no memory of MS. Without HSCT, there is a 100% probability that Katie’s RRMS will continue to progress. At this point, this is the best option to halt the progression of this disease and maybe erase some of the systems. This is not a cure, but it is hope.        Since HSCT is very limited in the States, Katie and I will travel to Mexico so that she can receive HSCT.  Insurance will not cover the cost of the procedure. We are seeking donations to offset the cost of HSCT and follow-up care, which is approximately $60,000.      Katie wants to have this procedure because she is tried of living a half a live.  She beats herself up because she worries that she is not a good enough mother.  In her words, “Áine deserves better.”  Doctors consider Katie “stable” but she goes to work every day with debilitating headaches and exhaustion.        We are grateful for the wonderful care Katie has received at MGH, for our large, loving family and a great community of friends.  We will be holding a fundraiser sometime early this summer.  We hope you will join us or consider donating thru this site.       Fear has two meanings: Forget Everything and Run or Face Everything and Rise!  Katie has chosen to Rise!",226,373,4,256,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is now undergoing chemo and radiation therapies to manage the multiple brain tumors and we are praying for a positive outcome. Laura has been the family’s source of income for the last two years, since Markus has been diagnosed with Neuropathy, which is preventing him from being able to work.  Struggling with these life challenges has been hard enough, and now the cancer is back! With two kids at home, 12-year-old Nina and 17-year-old Stefan, we are concerned about their day-to-day family needs, let alone the new (and recurring) medical bills, home and transportation costs, and other basic needs.  Markus, Laura, Nina and Stefan are such an amazing family who are generous at giving back to the community through their church, friends, and neighborhood and are always the first family in line to offer support for others in need. This is our time to give back. Laura’s positive attitude never ceases to amaze, even in her darkest hours. Please make a donation today to help this family survive through this difficult and challenging time and we ask that you pass on this link to others who would be able to give. If you cannot donate monetarily, maybe you have another resource that could help the family in another capacity, that would be just as valuable.

While Andrew and Giana are devastated at the news, they are steadfast in their resolve to fight this battle lockstep with and for their eldest son. This is not the first battle that Henry has had to wage. Born 10 weeks premature, Henry spent the first 5 weeks of his life in the NICU at Cottage Hospital weighing just 3 pounds. Andrew and Giana hardly ever left his side and brought him home a healthy, albeit small, baby boy. Since then, Henry has grown to be a big boy, full of life and always ready to play and have fun. Even now, admitted into the ICU at Cottage Hospital, Henry is continuing to find joy in his surroundings and looking for the next opportunity to get up and play. At this point, we don't yet know the severity of the cancer. Tomorrow Henry will undergo surgery where a port will be inserted in order to push chemotherapy and other drugs. He'll have bone marrow pulled to determine the type of Cancer. He'll also have a spinal tap to determine if the Cancer has spread to his spinal cord. His stay in the Hospital could be limited to 10 days, or as long as 4 months. We just don't know yet. He's facing at least a three year battle of serious steroid and chemotherapy treatments at this point.Our family is rallying behind Andrew, Giana, Henry and Hudson. We will fight this fight together utilizing every resource available to us. Andrew and Giana will be focusing 100% of their time to healing Henry and making his physical and mental state as comfortable as possible. During this time, neither will be able to work.

Landon has been diagnosed with Stage IV Glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer there is, in his frontal lobe. Landon is only 39 years old. After experiencing severe headaches and slight personality changes, Landon received a brain scan on February 28, 2018. The MRI revealed a massive tumor in the 7 cm range (the size of an orange). With no time to waste, he and his family packed their bags and immediately flew to the island of O'ahu to undergo surgery to remove the brain tumor.Surgery went well, with 98-100% of the tumor successfully removed! Landon did experience several strokes during surgery, resulting in some of the deeper parts of his brain dying. However, their beloved surgeon, Dr. Kumar, believes that other parts of his brain can compensate for that and expects Landon to be able to make a full recovery (in terms of brain damage).  Now, Landon requires extensive treatment. Dr. Kumar recommends the ""gold standard"" of treatment, which includes both chemotherapy and radiation. Another treatment option would be Optune; a wearable device and fairly new & successful method. After the ""gold standard"" treatment, it is suggested to pursue a clinical trial for immunotherapy at one of the nations leading cancer facilities.  In conjunction with the conventional treatments, the Johnson family will be attacking the cancer from many other angles, including; nutrition (keto diet- to starve any remaining cells from their glucose food source), exercise, stress reduction, supplements, medical marijuana, infrared sauna, and so much more. The average survival time with Glioblastoma (grade 4) with regular treatment is 12-18 months - only 20% of glioblastoma patients survive more than one year, and only 3% of patients survive more than three years. With the radical treatments, clinical trials, and age on our side, his chances can be greatly increased- with a 20% chance of surviving 5+ years. In some cases, patients can live up to 20+ years!! With that said- the Johnson famliy NEEDS funds to be able to pursue radical treatments and give Landon his best chance at living a long, fulfilling life.Landon has touched and continues to impact the lives of countless people: as a social worker, small business owner, son, husband, and now father. He lives on the island of Maui and loves to surf, travel, be in the ocean, and of course, spend time with his new son & beautiful wife. We humbly request assistance in restoring hope for the Johnson family. Your contribution will help cover the astronomical costs of treatment, travel costs, loss of income, rehabilitation, and quality of life for the Johnson famliy during this unimaginably difficult time.",344,1.1k,18,342,5 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Among many things, SJS attacks the mucus membranes and left his lungs severely damaged. He went from being a successful multisport athlete and student, to one that struggled aerobically on the field. Not willing to quit, he trained to become a Goal Keeper hoping he could reduce the cardiovascular demands on his body and hoping he could continue to play the game he loved. Dylan adjusted to his new base line of 50% lung capacity and still competed at some of the highest club and high school soccer levels. His teammates will remember him as the player who finished the runs long after the rest of the team, but he always finished. His determination and commitment to everything he did was admirable. Over the past 4 years his lungs declined further from a MRSSA infection and then Pneumonia. At 18%, he had to make the hardest call of his life to the college coach he had committed to play soccer for in Minnesota; his primary concern was not himself, but for the teammates that he knew would depend on him. Evaluation began in September 2017 at University of Washington Medical Center for potential Bilateral Lung Transplant. On Saturday, July 14th Dylan received the incredible gift of new Lungs from a donor, something he can only repay by making the same commitment to life he always has. This type of organ transplant is a very intensive surgery that comes with life-long requirements for medications and treatments.

My husband’s name is Stephen Boulanger and he has been struggling with brain cancer since November 2008. If any of you know Steve personally then you would know what a fun, amazing person he is. He has always been really smart and witty. He is a loving husband and father to two young children and a great friend to many. I think one of my favorite things about Steve is that he can always make me laugh. I mean really laugh like until your sides start to hurt laugh. I love this about him! Steve has gone through so much in his young life and it really hasn’t been fair, but he has still found hope despite the challenges.   I honestly don’t know how he has managed to stay so upbeat and positive. He keeps fighting and I admire him greatly for this.  I will never forget when Steve was first diagnosed with a brain tumor. I was actually with him when he had a sudden grand mal seizure in a coffee shop. He was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance and we later discovered that the seizure was caused by a golf ball sized grade 2 oligoastrocytoma. This discovery would change our lives forever. Steve had an awake craniotomy (brain surgery) in December 2008 to have the tumor removed.  The surgery was successful, but the tumor began to return a few years later in October 2011, at which time Steve wasrequired to undergo six weeks of radiation treatment. I have to brag and say how strong my husband was during the radiation treatment. He received radiation every morning before work and then worked a full day of work without skipping a beat. It really amazes me how he did this without complaint.  You would never have known that he was receiving radiation treatment.   After a few stable years, the tumor began to grow again, and Steve underwent a second awake brain surgery in  September 2016.   A portion of the tumor was removed, but they couldn’t get it all without risking paralyzing him.  Unfortunately, the tumor started to grow again and Steve underwent another series of radiation treatments. This was followed by chemotherapy.  Unfortunately, the first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful.  The tumor was growing. Steve started experiencing alarming symptoms that were caused by the tumor. His right arm and right leg became very weak.  He began a new chemotherapy but again the tumor was spreading. Steve had to stop working and continues to be unable to work.  He has lost mobility in his right arm and right leg.  He is also experiencing short term memory issues. We are waiting to see if we are eligible to receive an experimental chemotherapy drug that is very expensive. We may be able to receive this drug as a charitable donation through the company.  Please pray that we do.  Steve has also started eating a Keto diet.  There have been some successful studies and testimonials that show that the Keto diet can help people with brain tumors and we are praying that Steve’s tumor shrinks while on this new way of eating.  Right now, I am Steve’s primary care giver.   I am unable to work because Steve needs daily care.  It has been heartbreaking to watch the person you love the most go through so many struggles.   My children are also watching their Daddy struggle and this is tough as well.  We are asking for donations, however big or small, to help with medical expenses, food for his new diet, and living expenses.  We feel so blessed to have supportive family and friends.   Please consider donating to this fund and if not, then please pray for Steve.   We are praying for a miracle.

Backstory:  As many of you know, 6 months ago, our Dad (Dan Frost), was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. His particular type of cancer is rare and more complex than the majority of prostate cancer cases. Because of this, choosing the right treatment has taken time. The last 6 months we have watched our parents spend countless hours researching, meeting with multiple oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and looked at almost every alternative medicine path available. After much prayer and seeking wisdom in an extremely difficult decision process, our Dad has finally felt peace and made a decision to move forward with 7 weeks of radiation treatment at UCLA Medical Center. He will have two different kinds of radiation that will both target the tumors on his prostate and the area surrounding the prostate, where cancer cells may have migrated.We are a family that believes in the power of prayer and a God who is more than able to heal cancer completely! While we cry out daily to see our Dad healed in this way, we know that he is faithfully walking out the course the Lord has him on for now. Plot Twist: One week away from his scheduled treatment, Dad and Mom received a 30 day notice to leave their home of seven years. Their landlord is selling the property they have been renting in Redding, CA. Because they need to be in LA for 2 months of treatment for Dad, they now only have two weeks to be out of their house. They are quickly packing up their home and placing all their belongings in storage. A few of us kids are taking some time off work to fly out to help them pack and take care of the heavy lifting. They will head to LA with just their suitcases and car, but expectant for God to show them the next steps toward a home. Strongest people we know need help:If you know our story, you know that 17 years ago our parents were called into full time ministry working with political leaders on Capitol Hill. They’ve poured out their life and finances to serve the kingdom. They haven’t skipped a beat in spite of cancer and are continuing to serve. Through this season so many of you have asked us how you can help. As their family we would love if you joined with us in covering them in this process.Prayers:We first and foremost need your prayers. Will you join us as we cover our Dad in the following areas: - Seeking God with us in seeing our Dad’s body completely healed. - Pray for God’s presence and wisdom to guide every doctor in this complicated treatment. - Pray that treatment attacks cancer in every location of our Dad’s body and that it won’t return. - Pray for both our parents to have supernatural strength and that the stress of all the details won’t take a toll on their spirits or bodies.Finances:Cancer not only comes with a heavy burden health wise, but also with a hefty price tag. We are watching our parents bills grow with medical expenses, scans/treatments that are not covered by insurance, cost of travel to appointments out of state, lodging, prescriptions and now the expenses of moving and finding a new home. It is our hearts to go above and beyond to help cover all the extra costs associated with this journey. We would love if you considered joining us by helping them financially. Every little bit helps and will give them one less thing they have to worry about during this incredibly difficult time. Thank you:We also want to recognize and thank all of you who have showed up for our parents in the most profound ways.  Your prayers, notes, phone calls, texts, financial support, houses, helping hands and so much more has so deeply touched the hearts of our parents. We often receive phone calls with our parents in tears from the kindness and generosity that has been shown to them from so many. We can confidently say they have felt so surrounded and loved in this process.

Medical,22,Healing Hendrix,https://www.gofundme.com/HendrixTorres,"SAN DIEGO, CA","May 20, 2018","$50,000","$49,491","Dear Friends & Family, Most of you are aware that our son Hendrix has been having a pretty rough time the last couple of months. We now think everything began this past November when he was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. Soon after that diagnosis, we noticed he started having motor tics and began complaining of neck pain, nausea and stomachaches. About that same time he started having difficulty at school, pulling away from friends, sports and all of the things he normally loved to do. Unfortunately, that was just the beginning of our story. On February 13th, with no previous warning, Hendrix began shaking uncontrollably, slurring his words and making jerky, uncoordinated movements. His eyes were dilated and he was exhibiting the signs and symptoms of a stroke, brain tumor, or a seizure disorder. As you can imagine, even though Jalayne is an RN, we were very scared, especially since Hendrix himself asked to go to the hospital because he could not control his own body. We drove him to the ER, but on the way Hendrix became extremely confused and did not remember where we were going or why. By the time we saw a doctor, Hendrix returned to normal and after a short assessment, he was discharged. Unfortunately, over the next week, Hendrix deteriorated rapidly and was unable to attend school and both of us were unable to go to work.  On the night of the 22nd, Hendrix became so unhinged that we called 911 and left for the ER in restraints in an ambulance. Two hours later, he returned to normal and the hospital discharged him again with nothing more than another basic exam. The next morning, we took Hendrix back to his pediatrician’s office and begged for help and for them to admit him to the hospital for further testing. Finally, Hendrix was admitted to the hospital for three days. After his tests showed relatively normal/benign results, we were told that our son was medically cleared and that we had a behavior issue on our hands and he was discharged. Three hours after that discharge, we had to call 911 again because Hendrix became worse than ever before.  Once again we arrived to the hospital via ambulance with Hendrix on a stretcher. We requested readmission to the medical floor for further testing, but our request was denied since Hendrix had just been medically cleared. We were then advised that the best place for him was the psychiatric unit. We spent three days and two nights in the ER with him waiting for a room to open up on the psychiatric unit. As you might imagine, there are no words to explain the stress, confusion, despair and guilt we felt during that time. Knowing this was a medical issue, we agonized over the best thing to do for our son and ultimately decided to follow our instincts and asked to be discharged immediately.  We returned home and at this point were now in the middle of a full-blown crisis. Our family was completely overwhelmed. It has been devastating for us to helplessly watch the Hendrix we know and love decline and deteriorate physically, mentally, and emotionally right before our eyes. There are no words to describe the nightmare our family has been living. We just wanted our little boy back. After months of dealing with non-responsive caregivers here in California we chose to get on a plane and take Hendrix to the East Coast to see specialists at NYU and St. Peter’s Hospital at Rutgers. So many wonderful souls went out of their way to help us with this complicated, expensive and risky journey traveling across the country with a very sick child. Thankfully the trip was the right decision because Hendrix has finally been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis (along with PANS and Neuropathy) and received his first treatment infusion of IVIG on May 11th just in time for his 10th birthday.  Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare disease that causes inflammation (swelling) of the brain. The doctors believe that the walking pneumonia infection triggered Hendrix’s body to attack his brain causing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as cognitive, memory and movement dysfunction. Hendrix has been plagued with a wax and wane of debilitating symptoms including memory loss, confusion, severe separation anxiety, hallucinations, altered personality and behavior, psychosis, movements that he cannot control, clumsiness, difficulty walking, talking, chewing and swallowing, auditory/sensory issues and sleep disturbances. Basically, his brain is on fire, resulting in a sickness that is nearly impossible to describe. Because of this, we have not been able to leave Hendrix’s side, he has not been able to return to school and we both have been unable to return to work. The positive news is that many children have recovered from encephalitis and the brain has an amazing potential to heal. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment greatly improves his chances of improving. That said, we have a very long and difficult road ahead for all of us. Hendrix needs multiple infusions and extensive cognitive, physical and psychological therapy and at this point we do not know when we will be able to return to work. It's a very scary situation to face.  We continue to live day-by-day and sometimes minute-by-minute. Some days we see more of Hendrix and other days we wonder if we will ever have our son back. We remain positive and are ever hopeful that Hendrix will recover and we will not rest until we have tried everything to save him. We have come to realize that this is more than we can handle alone and are now reaching out to our friends and family asking for help in regards to Hendrix’s medical care and expenses.  We will be grateful for any donation but we completely understand if you are unable to contribute. Prayers for Hendrix and for our family are needed as well.  Thank you!  Beau & Jalayne",359,1.9k,15,367,3 months,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have a wonderful family, a wife, two daughters, 3 and 6 years old, good job. Life was going great until suddenly in August of 2017, a terrible diagnosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Stage 3 cancer was made which they deemed inoperable. Here also began, various medical tests, sleepless nights, bad thoughts which simply can’t get rid of. I think I am understood by those who have ever faced this ailment.Doctors at first said that I needed an operation to remove the pancreas that would prolong life, but needed to go through a couple of chemotherapy courses to reduce size of the tumors. At that point there were two of them. Two months of chemotherapy and the prognosis was positive in which the tumors reduced in size. After the prior session the Doctors recommended another two months of continuous chemotherapy which after unfortunately proved to not end up working.  The original size of the tumors returned and the physicians once again recommended further radiation and treatment. Even before I made it to my appointment I ended up in the ER with an abundance of pain. Tests, CT Scans were done in which they found that the tumors grew and spread into the liver attributing to Stage 4 Liver cancer as well. In my gut I felt that due to the intense radiation and chemotherapy instead of it helping in actuality it only increased the size of the tumors and helped them to spread. Until this point the doctors and I had hope that a surgery would be an option but at this given time that is no longer an option. The doctors pretty much gave up on my case and told me nothing else can be done and to wait it out. No one can really imagine how difficult it was the next step I had to go through when I had to inform my family of this prognosis, pretty much telling them I have limited amount of time to live. There are other treatments that give hope to patients like myself but of course require additional funding. In life, every person at one moment reaches a point in which they have to ask for help. I hoped that I had enough strength and money to fight this battle by myself but unfortunately my health is disintegrating and further funds are needed for new treatment that provided more hope for recovery. I have my wife and kids to live for and can’t imagine giving up on them. Thank you very much.Dmitry.",429,1.2k,8,435,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Duodenal Atresia is the congenital absence or complete closure of a portion of the lumen of the duodenum (in the small intestine). It causes increased levels of amniotic fluid during pregnancy and intestinal obstruction in newborn babies. At one day old, Billy had emergency surgery to correct the “kink” in his small intestine. The surgery was successful though Billy spent 5 weeks recovering in the NICU.Fast forward 30 years later, Billy has been able to live life to the fullest. He graduated Dickinson College with a degree in English. Pursued his passion by attending and graduating Tribeca Film Academy in Chicago. Got his dream job at Cutters Studio working his butt off to become Editor, which he achieved January 2018. He met his best friend and the love of this life, Briggs. Not only did he convince his Southern Belle to move from Atlanta to Chicago but he quickly knew to never let her go and married her on March 28th, 2015. I know Billy would still say that was the best day of his life. Until this year. On March 21st, 2018, Briggs and Billy welcomed their beautiful daughter Ann (Annie) Maynard Montross, named in honor of Annie’s grandmothers. If you asked anyone who knows Billy, they would say he is the nicest, kindest, most thoughtful and patient man they know. An accomplished film editor, golfer, hockey player, baseball player, artist, drummer, food enthusiast. I think my grandmother said it best when we were growing up, Billy is the angel in our family. And he is the rock for his two girls, Briggs and Annie. On Thursday, May 24th, Billy admitted himself into New York Presbyterian Hospital suffering from severe stomach pains, soon to be discover it was stemming from his small intestine. Over the next week, Billy underwent 4 surgeries on his small intestine. The initial surgery was to remove the buildup of scar tissue; however, as his condition evolved and his body attempted to recover, his small intestine did not survive his surgeries. Billy is now left with approximately 2 inches remaining of his small intestine (for size reference, the small intestine can range from 9 feet to 35 feet). He is being administered TPN (total parenteral nutrition) through an IV to provide his body the essential nutrients, as he cannot eat or drink, and has a G tube connected to a colostomy bag to continually drain his stomach.He is still in the hospital in NYC. He is making progress with regaining his strength and we hope to have him home within the next week or so.  Billy, Briggs, Annie and the Montross family has been so appreciative of people’s love, support, thoughts and prayers over the past month.

He was released there after two weeks at the hospital. He is expected to return home for continued therapy there  on April 20th. From there it is expected he will have months of therapy before there is hope of a full recovery.Many of you know Doug as a long-standing Aspen Valley resident and manager of Rustique. Anyone who knows Doug knows him as a generous and kind person. My sister and I are so lucky to have him as our brother, he's always there for support and encouragement. He selflessly offered his time and energy to take care of our mother after her medical problems, taking her into his home. Recently he has had such happiness come into his life- a beautiful fiancé named Nok, a growing family (four kids), a new house, a new baby and an exciting new job as a Director of Food and Beverage for a hotel in the Snowmass area.  This stroke can be devastating for Doug and his family.

He was 24 and newly married to his wife, Amanda. By the grace of our loving Lord, he enjoyed almost three years of clear scans. As of November 2017, Matt has been in another intense treatment phase. The tumor has regrown and for the moment, continues to grow. BUT GOD. He is making ways in the wilderness, streams in the wasteland. (Isaiah 43:19). We serve a miracle-working God who has already payed the price for our salvation and our healing. (1 Peter 2:24) The unconventional treatment that Matt is in now offers a lot of hope. It is a 12-hour a day job for both he and Amanda, but it is where God has led them, and that is all they need to know to stay on the path He has directed. He is currently into the newest protocol which includes 140+ pills a day, 96 ounces of fresh-pressed juice, multiple doctor’s appointments each week, ongoing consults with doctors across the southeast and outside of the country. The treatments being pursued are not covered by insurance and the costs are staggering. But God always provides. “Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.” - Matthew 10:29-31 Be steadfast in prayer. We believe we are weeks, days, even minutes away from seeing complete healing in Matt’s body. And that may sound crazy, BUT we know He has already commanded it. He is able and willing. God doesn’t change. He is the same God he was in the Bible. His love for Lazarus, the leper, the blind man, is the same as His love for Matt. He doesn’t deny help or any good thing to those who walk uprightly. (Psalm 84:11) Matt and Amanda do not view the costs of his treatment as anyone else's responsibility but our their own and should people choose to bless us financially, any amount is seen as the greatest gift.

Whether it be his podcast The Shoot, his YouTube channel, or his Instagram, Matt has been promoting, educating, and sharing his love of photography for years. He’s given so much to the photographic community at large, and now it’s time we showed our appreciation and gave back to him.I could try and explain what’s going on, but I think it’s best if it came from Matt’s wife Molly herself:“As many of you know, Matt has had a rough few weeks. I just wanted to get the full story out there to fill in the gaps:Last Friday (6/29/18), he told me he had a migraine. When I got home from work Sunday morning, he apparently had been vomiting all night and couldn't tolerate loud sounds or any light, so I took him to the ER for some fluids and a migraine cocktail. This helped for a while, but that night he started to have fevers. By Tuesday, the headache was worse and he had been consistently vomiting and not voiding, so he went back to the ER where he was treated for dehydration and they considered a lumbar puncture, but decided against it at that time and sent him home. He continued to have high fevers at home, and on Wednesday afternoon, he came out of our room and was covered in a rash and confused. I took him back to the ER and he ended up being admitted. All night his vitals were off. He received lots of fluids to bring his blood pressure up and his heart rate down. He had to be placed on a cooling blanket to bring down his fever. He was eventually moved to the ICU stepdown unit where he has been ever since to closely monitor him. Infectious disease is confident that this is a result from either a tick-borne illness or West Nile virus. He has received doxycycline for the tick illnesses. He is experiencing quite a few complications. He now has pneumonia, a UTI, and inflammation in his brain. His vitals are better now, but today he is experiencing some neurological symptoms that are concerning, so he will be transferred to Riverside. He is stable and talking, he just needs a higher level of care at this point. Thank you so much to all of my wonderful coworkers who have given him THE BEST care. Thank you to all of our friends and family for your help with kids and animals. Thank you for all of your prayers and good vibes sent. He certainly needs them right now. ❤️”Thoughts and prayers are certainly appreciated, but I know we can do more for the Day family right now.

So donate knowing that all money will go right to the Day family.Any size donation/contribution will be appreciated. And if you can’t donate, please spread the word!

Joslyn has wanted to be a mommy forever. Joslyn and Jeremy had their first child on Monday 6/18/2018, but it was not the fairytale birth and celebration that every parent hopes for. Joslyn had to be induced early (about a month) and during the preparation for induction, Joslyn began having severe breathing issues. She lost consciousness and she flatlined for 15 minutes. They were able to get the baby out within five minutes of Joslyn flat-lining. Both mom and baby are fighting hard for their lives. Joslyn remains in an induced coma to allow her brain and body to heal from all the trauma. Baby is also in an induced coma. Both mom and baby are stable at this time, but the prognosis is still completely up in the air at this point. Staying in the hospital in ICU and NICU for a day is insanely costly and both Joslyn and baby have been in the hospital about five days now.

(lol) She made a comment in the car that day that I didn't pick up on.... About 4 hours later in the operating room during a c-section it hit me! I looked over and said ""Franny get over here! Are you pregnant!??"" And of course Fran gave a goofy look and laughed saying ""how did you know?""(lol)Then, a few months later, I secretly came to find out at work one night that not only were they expecting but it was TWINS! I was SO EXCITED! And of course probably due to my over excitement, Francesca honored me with the pleasure of helping with her gender reveal.  My husband and I stuffed 2 giant balloons with confetti, painted them, POPPED them, freaked out, ran to the store, bought new giant balloons, stuffed those, and then tried to hide all the confetti evidence before Fran & Dave showed up for these balloons.  The Webster's could not have been blessed with more perfect girls.  Emma & Zoe have their own individual personalities, but are both sweet and loving, funny, and you can easily see that special ""Twin"" bond they have.  This past week has been every mother's nightmare.... Monday night I sat with Fran, talking about Emma's behavior which we both summed up to her turning 2 and having molar's coming in.  However, Francesca being the most amazing mother that she is, knew something wasn't right.  The next day She took Emma to the Pediatrician and ended up having to take her down to Johns Hopkins Hospital.Emma was found to have an enlarged liver and spleen. After tests and a biopsy, it was found that sweet Emma has high risk neuroblastoma - cancer in her lymph nodes & abdomen.  This next year is going to be long, stressful, and painful.    I am asking for love and prayers for all the Webter's as well as the DeFranco's.  I am also asking for generosity.

It was determined the bacteria entered her system through an ear infection she had been battling.  As of today, August 9th, she remains in a coma.  My sister Kristen is the loving mother of two young children Rylie age 9 & Grayson age 5. Together with her husband James, they lived a simple life in the hills surrounding Waynesville, North Carolina. With simple means, they lived in a rental house they’ve made their own.

Medical,23,Help Matt Cremen,https://www.gofundme.com/help-matt-cremen,"Bronxville,","July 18, 2018","$45,000","$48,585","Back in June of 2016, little did Matt know that life as he knew it would change forever. Now, Matt needs an Intestinal Transplant.Matt has been diagnosed with a condition called myopathic pseudo-obstruction .  This means that the smooth muscles that move food along in his digestive tract, have stopped working.  As a result, he can no longer eat and has daily episodes of extreme vomiting.  Since he cannot eat, he needs to be fed intravenously with TPN (Total Parental Nutrition) .  Each night he is hooked up to his TPN and it runs over the course of 12 hours, in order for him to live.While TPN is a lifesaver, it comes with some serious long term complications.  TPN is extremely hard on the liver and many people that are on TPN for an extended amount of time will go into liver failure.  In addition, line infections are quite common (Matt has already had two) and can lead to sepsis.  Other health issues associated with long term TPN are developing osteoporosis, cholecystitis and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.The only “cure” for myopathic pseudo-obstruction, is an intestinal transplant.   An intestinal transplant  is the most complex and rare of all the organ transplants.  To give you an idea, last year there were only 109 intestinal transplants compared to 19,850 kidney transplants in the United States.  Due to it rarity and complexity, it is also the most expensive single medical procedure in the U.S., costing a whopping $1.2 million dollars.While Matt has health insurance that will cover the bulk of the medical expenses, there are many additional financial aspects of care and recovery, which are not covered by insurance.  He will spend the first five days in the ICU and is expected to be in the hospital anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks.  During this time his wife will need to take unpaid time off from work, especially in the very beginning.  Dana will be able to stay at a “transplant house” for the first few days after his surgery that is just blocks from hospital, but it is not free.  Once Matt is stable and moved from the ICU, Dana will return home to get back to work and be there for their two girls, Madison and Alexis.During the remainder of his hospital stay Dana and their daughters will commute into the city as often as possible to visit Matt.  Whether it’s by car or mass transit, the costs of going into the city will quickly add up.  Once Matt is finally discharged, he will be coming home on approximately 20 medications, which will cost around $1250 - $1,500 a month out of pocket.  He may also need in home nursing care, which is only partially covered by insurance.  Matt will also need to make weekly trips back into the city to ensure he is progressing and not having an issues with rejection or graft vs. host disease.  With intestinal transplants, there can be many ups and downs over the course of the first year and additional hospital stays are not uncommon.  In addition to the upcoming expenses, his existing medical bills are just under $8,000.  Thank you for considering donating, it's greatly appreciated!

Steve is an inspiration to me and I’m sure to many of you as well. As many of you are aware, Steve and his wonderful family find themselves battling cancer for the third time. He’s been receiving monthly chemo/immunotherapy treatments at the Mayo Clinic since August 2017. While the treatments have stopped cancer growth in some areas, other areas continue to grow. As a result of genomic testing of the cancer, it was discovered that his cancer is most likely being driven by a specific mutation in the BRAF Gene. While there is no FDA approved targeted therapy for this specific BRAF mutation, MD Anderson is running a Phase 1 clinical trial with a drug that they believe has a chance to work on his cancer. Steve and Wendy traveled to Houston this week where he has been going through 3 days of multiple tests and a biopsy of one of the tumors. Fortunately, Steve has passed the screening and has been accepted into the trial that is testing the drug LXH254. This drug was developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. His first day on the trial will be Monday, April 16th. Steve and his family are grateful to his team of doctors at Mayo Clinic, who referred him to MD Anderson.While these treatments provide Steve with hope, they also bring forth tremendous costs, and I am hoping as a community we can assist the Rogers family in this battle against this awful disease. All funds raised will help with the living, travel, and out of pocket treatment costs the Rogers family will incur on this journey to defeat cancer for the final time!We will be updating the Post Hope website many of you are familiar with during Steve’s previous fight.  https://posthope.org/steve-rogers",172,158,4,171,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The Poulsen family received news that Chris had two masses in his brain and one in his lungs. After a biopsy and imaging, Chris was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic melanoma and has since began radiation treatment. Chris and Jenny have four beautiful children: Riley (16), Ashton (14), Aiden (11), and Anders (7).

My wife Jules and I are shocked and saddened utterly devastated to announce that our lives have been completely upended by the discovery of what looks to be stage 4 neuroblastoma in our amazing 15 month old daughter Karin Quinn aka “Kiki.”Whether you call her Karin, Quinn, Kiki or Baby Q, the fact remains- she is amazing and uniquely fun, smart, and beautiful- our only daughter and the center of our world. On June 14, Jules and Barbara Dockery took Quinn to her pediatrician to check out whether Baby’s cute pot belly was anything to worry about.  He recommended an ultrasound to be sure. She immediately underwent an ultrasound procedure at Tarzana Children’s Hospital which revealed a large mass on her liver. Julie and Quinn were transported via ambulance to UCLA for admission. Here we remain. An MRI and CT scan revealed that Quinn has what appears to be a rare, aggressive and particularly lethal form of cancer known as neuroblastoma, an evil disease that lurks in healthy babies and then strikes. In diagnosing this disease, Kiki underwent two biopsies, one on the mass itself (about the size of potato, located next to her liver), and another sample from her pelvic bone. They are anticipating that the cancer has spread to her bones.  It will take more time to confirm this, but what is being discussed now is the reality of stage four neuroblastoma. This is as bad as it gets. In our future is the entire spectrum of aggressive cancer treatments. Our precious baby will be subjected to Chemo, radiation, surgery, stem cells, and possibly be brought to the brink of death in order to heal from this terrible disease.  No less than 3 lives are on the line. The outpouring of support we’ve received from our friends and family is incredible.  Many have asked what, if anything can be done to help. First, hug your loved ones and be kind to them. Second, donate blood, if you can. Third, send healing thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to baby Quinn. We really really need to catch a lucky break. Without prompting, Julie’s sister Crystal initiated this gofundme page in support of Kiki.  We are NOT expecting donations but we understand that for many, donating to be a part of Quinn’s fund will feel like a concrete step on the road to recovery, and we are grateful for the support.

He was rushed to the University of Maryland’s Shock Trauma Center and underwent surgery for his injury.  The surgery involved procedures on two separate days that removed the shattered vertebra and fused part of his cervical spine.  He subsequently underwent three additional surgeries and spent one month in the ICU.   He will require more surgeries during his clinical course.  Currently, Stephen retains complete mental capacity as well as the use of his shoulders and biceps but unfortunately, has not regained movement of his hands and lower extremities.Stephen has a long road ahead of him.  He was recently transferred to Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia where he will work with physical and occupational therapists for the next several months.  He is finally off the ventilator and now has a tracheostomy.  He will need cough assistance until he can strengthen his own coughing.In addition to the five surgeries and one month in the ICU, upcoming expenses will be immense and ongoing. The expenses include outpatient rehabilitation that will extend over the next year, electronic wheelchair and other home assistive devices, vehicles that can accommodate his limitations and allow him to drive and ongoing daily nursing assistance.With the support of his mother, father, brother, and girlfriend, Kate, he has remained the same upbeat, positive person we all know and love.  He is determined to return to his initial ambition of completing medical school.  He is a fighter.  It is not easy to ask for help, but any contribution would be greatly appreciated and allow Stephen to focus on his recovery and care.Whether or not you are able to make a donation, please consider sharing this fundraiser and story on social media to spread awareness.  Stephen has been such a great friend to all of us.  Please feel free to let him know you are thinking about him by writing a comment on this page.  Also please follow his CaringBridge site:   www.caringbridge.org/visit/stephenharrison.“Don’t pray for an easy life.  Pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.” – Bruce Lee“Believe in a way Back”—Magee Rehabilitation Hospital“Once you choose hope, anything is possible”—Christopher ReevesPlease keep Stephen in your thoughts and prayers.-Casey Tang",461,1.1k,14,458,21 days,2 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

After numerous operations attempting to relieve the pressure in his brain, we find ourselves on the edge of our seats in the ICU. Because his pressures (both brain and blood) are still too high, the doctors have had him sedated throughout the process, and we have no idea as to what type of damage has been done to his brain and body. For those that don’t know, my dad has operated his own family run, small business for the last 20+ years as a Chiropractor, earnestly seeking to improve the quality of life of everyone he comes into contact with. Famous for providing more care for less money, dad did whatever it took to leave his patients better than he found them, while still providing for his family.

As we continue to pray for a miracle, my mother has not left his side, and my brothers and I continue to do all we can to ease the pressures of this situation. Though the amount may seem high, the cost of care is already enormous, and even the most optimistic of outcomes leads to at least another 2-3 weeks of 24/7 care in the ICU.

We live in The Colony, TX and decided to start his cancer treatment in Dallas, Texas in hopes that a few rounds of chemo would be the answer. After 3 rounds of BEP we thought we had the “all clear” but, just before Jan 2018, we found out that the cancer was back and had started to spread. We decided to seek a second opinion and made the drive to MD Anderson in Houston, TX for further treatment. They started Michael on an aggressive treatment of TIP chemo in hopes they could slow the cancer from spreading. After a week-long stay in the hospital we were discharged with the news that the TIP chemo was not effective. The doctors at MD Anderson suggested an RPLND surgery to physically remove all traces of the tumor.The RPLND surgery occurred on 4/13/18 and Michael recovered well. His blood work seemed to show we were cancer free. Towards the middle of May, Michael was having severe back pain accompanied with abdominal bloating. We traveled down to MD Anderson for the post-op appointments and found out Michael’s cancer was back and more aggressive than ever. They started Michael on chemo right away to try and slow down the cancer’s progression.Michael’s doctors at MD Anderson have told us that traditional cancer therapy (chemo, radiation, etc.) will not cure his cancer and that we should seek alternative therapy.

Medical,25,Juniper's Journey,https://www.gofundme.com/juniper039s-journey,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN","June 23, 2018","$15,000","$47,035","Juniper’s Journey:After meeting in college (CSB/SJU!), Colin and I became best friends and fell in love. From the early stages of our relationship, it became clear that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. We got engaged in Alaska and had an amazing wedding nearly five years ago. We’ve been together for over ten years now. We’ve always dreamt that our life together would include children, and over two years ago, we started trying for our first child. That was a journey of its own...as many can attest to, we (naively) did not anticipate difficulty in conceiving a child. The morning after Thanksgiving in 2017, I was brushing my teeth and decided to take a pregnancy test. It was positive. Have you ever felt a joy so electric that it completely takes over every fiber of your being? This was that feeling, and that feeling continued to grow as baby grew too. At our 21-week anatomy scan, we found out that it’s a girl! Luckily, we had already agreed on the perfect name for our sweet summer daughter - Juniper.The days following that scan turned our happiness and excitement into what can only be described as primal fear. We received a very unexpected call that we would need to have a follow-up appointment with the maternal fetal medicine clinic for a level 2 ultrasound, as they were not able to get images of all four chambers of her heart at the anatomy scan. (Cue panic.) What resulted from the level 2 ultrasound raised more specific concerns regarding June’s heart, including a suspected diagnosis of heterotaxy. (Cue confusion and more panic.) We were then referred to the pediatric cardiology team at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, where a fetal echocardiogram revealed yet more details on Juniper’s congenital heart defects and provided us with a clearer pathway to treatment. The incredibly high quality of care we’ve been receiving at the University of Minnesota has helped bring some relief back into our lives; we know we are in great hands there. From what Juniper’s care team can currently determine (in utero), she has several congenital heart defects specific to her condition including HLHS/single ventricle, VSD, ASD, malposition of the great arteries and pulmonary atresia, in addition to her stomach being on the right side of her body. Essentially, this means that she will need a series of surgeries in order to maintain function of her heart and other organs to be able to live out her life like she very much deserves to do. Currently, she is projected to have four heart surgeries throughout her life...the first of which will happen soon after she is born. Since success of the first surgery will be dependent on a multitude of assessments made at birth, we are looking at a lengthy first stay in the hospital for recovery time before we can take our daughter home.The time we will both be able to spend with our new baby while she is in the NICU/CICU will be so important for many reasons; being present to make important medical decisions regarding her recovery and future outlook, gaining knowledge and skills to be able to care for her special needs in and out of the hospital, and of course, loving on her as much as is humanly possible.We’ve wanted this beautiful baby for so long and we have been saving up the best we can, though we could never have anticipated our version of parenthood to look quite like this. Though I am fortunate enough to have qualified for 12 weeks of FMLA leave and can use what little sick time I’ve accrued in my first year of teaching, the remainder is all unpaid. Colin can use some hours he’s saved up to take some paid time off, but he has recently been informed of an unexpected transition in position which has resulted in a reduction of pay. I had intended to teach summer school, but following the advice of our care team, I will instead take these last few weeks of pregnancy to focus on my health. Colin will be working overtime as he can in the weeks left leading up to June’s birth to help supplement our sudden change in income. We are navigating it all the best we can given the cards we have been dealt, but we anticipate that being in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time will prove challenging in more ways than one. During the months of my maternity leave following Juniper’s birth, we will undoubtedly face financial difficulty with bills coming in from all angles, month-to-month expenses on a single, reduced income, medical supplies and medications we will need when we make the transition home, hospital life (meals, parking, etc.), and very importantly, saving up for all of the above when we go through this yet again for future surgeries. We are being reminded, over and over again, that life never stops, even when you’re in desperate need of a pause button. If we could alleviate at least one of the difficulties our family will face in the uncertain times ahead, it could really help us adjust to our new normal in the long run, whenever that may be. If you know us, you know that we’ve put off setting up this GoFundMe for quite some time. (Turns out it is really difficult to ask for help when you’d much rather give it than put yourself out there to receive it...especially when it involves financial support.) But, after a lot of encouragement and strong suggestion from our loved ones in light of recent events, we decided to open it up and accept any and all assistance offered to us.

As you all know, Ivan is facing difficult medical challenges that are very costly and the road ahead will not be easy. This is a time where we can come together to help one of our own and his family. We would like to ask for all of us to (1) give what you can, no amount is too small (2) leverage your network to get the word out and get us to our goal of raising $30k to help cover the medical bills.  Ivan is a product of our community in Weston and just 1 year ago, at age 16 he was chasing a dream of playing professional soccer in Mexico, he was doing very well, gaining strength and experience. He now finds himself bedridden, weak and having a difficult time putting sentences together as doctors are still trying to identify the root cause of what is happening to him. Ivan's family is optimistic and is always by his side every step of the way but they do need our help as they go through this difficult journey. Thank you all in advance and let’s get this done!

Nathaniel set off to hike and climb Forbidden Peak, a famous climbing destination in the North Cascades. During his climb, he fell over 150 feet and sustained a severe spinal cord injury. Due to the actions of his climbing partner and another pair of climbers, Nathaniel was safely airlifted off the mountain to Harborview Medical Center. He underwent a successful surgery to stabilize his injuries, but the current prognosis is still dire - due to the damage on his C2-C7 vertebrae, he initially had no sensation or mobility below his neck.  But we’ve been witnessing small miracles this week, as he is now able to move his left arm, so we’re still hopeful for more improvements. He is currently still in the ICU, and is unable to breathe on his own at this time. Nathaniel had just completed his first year at the Dental School at the University of Washington, and he was passionate about many subjects and his thirst for exploration pushed him to pursue a life in the outdoors. He spent many hours in the calmness and beauty of Washington’s wilderness and climbing areas. Our hopes and dreams as a family is that he may one day return to the great outdoors. What Nathaniel Needs From UsNathaniel has positively impacted so many lives. We would like to acknowledge the overwhelming support from Nathaniel's friends, classmates, family and church. Please help us with Nathaniel’s long journey to recovery by aiding his family during this time of tragedy. Any amount is helpful, and please continue to pray for him. We will keep people informed of his progress moving forward through his Caring Bridge site, linked below.Modifications to his home, medical equipment, adaptive equipment, and assisting with the daunting amount of all the medical bills are a few of the many things this account is designed to help with. All funds will go directly to Nathaniel and his family. With love and gratitude,David, Rebecca, Chris, and Karisa",293,503,2,290,24 days,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

These blockages were being removed and coming back within 24 hours and blocking her entire airway.  They immediately took her for her SECOND surgery and put her into the hospital to be monitored 24 hours a day.  They gave her high doses of steroids hoping that might help but by Friday morning these blockages were back and Colleen was going in for her THIRD surgery in THREE days.At this point, we were devastated by this news.  We needed help.  Her doctors at Memorial Hospital and her doctor at Barnes were working together to find out as much as possible regarding Wegener's and what could be done to help her.  Her doctor at Barnes was able to contact doctors at Harvard and Cleveland to find out some good information on treatment. By Saturday morning, Colleen had her FOURTH surgery in FOUR days to remove yet ANOTHER blockage.  After a lot of discussions by the doctors at Memorial, Barnes, Harvard, and Cleveland they removed the blockage and also injected steroids and topical chemotherapy into the trachea.  They also started Colleen on a chemotherapy drug, which will be given once a week for four weeks to try and help her.  She will continue to be in the hospital so that they can monitor her 24 hours a day and be sure she has a clear airway daily and hope that the chemotherapy treatment along with the steroid injections all work together to put her Wegener's in remission.  Colleen's husband Joe has been out of work for over a month now and will continue to have to stay with her until the doctors give the okay for her to go home.  They are going to need to add a system to their two home heating and air systems that adds moisture into their house.  The stress alone of being in the hospital away from your kids would make it hard on any family and then add in regular bills, the doctors bills and the continued physical therapy Colleen will still need when she does come home, and the heating/air system that is essential for her to have that this family just needs some help from family, friends, and maybe even the kindness of strangers.  So many of you have reached out to help, so I think this would be a great way to help alleviate some of the stress that the Stevens family  has due to this horrific disease that has turned this family's world upside down. Thank you to all those willing to help them during their time of need.",451,925,5,455,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

The most devastating was to see that all of the cancer was sitting on her aorta which made the procedure life-threatening if they continued. With top experts on the phone from all over the county, and those in the operating room, the collective decision was to not proceed and leave everything as is. Onto the next treatment plan she went which included more chemo as soon as her body was able to handle it.One can only imagine how strong the fight is, and has been. And if you know anything about the Torosyan family, you know what a unit they are.

I have been suffering debilitating motor symptoms including tremors, rigidity, stiffness, slowed movement, and walking problems as a result of Early Onset Parkinson’s Disease for many years. During this time I have continued to work full time to provide for my son John's care and multiple therapies as he grows up with autism.  Just recently, I have taken advantage of a small window of opportunity to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure for Parkinson's patients that requires several steps, each with mounting medical expenses.  A battery-operated device is implanted in the chest (similar to a pacemaker) to deliver electrical stimulation to the areas of the brain that control movement. The hope is that ultimately, I can continue to be an active participant in John’s life.   On June 19, 2018, the first surgery was successfully performed where a thin, insulated wire was inserted into my skull and implanted in the brain. On July 3, an implantable pulse generator (IPG) will be implanted in my chest.

It was VERY big, so big I was a few days away from it crushing my heart and causing it to stop.I need to get radiotherapy to ensure the cancer doesn´t return BUT, radiation to the chest (mediastinum) has a high probability of causing heart disease and secondary tumors--cancers caused by radiation that pop up 10-20 years after receiving the radiotherapy. I discovered that the most advanced form of radiotherapy is called ""Proton Therapy"" which reduces exposure to radiation of healthy tissue, almost eliminating the toxicity of traditional radiotherapy and it´s side-effects. There are very few places around the planet that offer it (less than 50 as far as I can tell) which makes it extremely expensive. I´ve found a place in northeastern Italy which does it for a fraction of what it costs in the US and other places.I need the funds ASAP so I can secure my spot, since I need to start treatment on August 16th, 2018.  I am 48 years YOUNG! and a father to a sweet, loving and smart 3 year old boy and husband to my beautiful and wise wife, and I NEED TO BE AROUND FOR MANY DECADES MORE!I´ve spent the last 32 years of my life doing my best to help people learn how to have more fulfilling lives, and I feel like I´ve just gotten started.

Lily says it was the best day of her life, filled with constant smiling and dancing. Like all aspects of his life, Greg worked hard to create their future together.

With no warning signs or previous symptoms, everyone was shaken to their core. Greg was rushed to the hospital, and immediately underwent surgery. After diagnostic tests, an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was determined to have caused a clot in his brain and a subsequent stroke.  After over a week in the ICU, sedation was lifted and intubation removed, allowing for the first glimpses of Greg’s spirit.

However, she is still struggling to pay for her daughter’s medical care, while also having to pay for her regular bills in the U.S. Elena had to leave her daughter behind to come to the United States and provide for her. Now she’s had to leave her all over again, at the most difficult time in her life, to do the same.We are asking everyone to donate what they can to help cover the cost of care for Elena’s daughter and to help Elena visit Guatemala more often.

In Connor's 10 short years on this earth, he touched more lives than most of us will in the 7 or 8 decades we are given. Connor suffered a ruptured AVM (brain) three weeks ago. In true Connor form, he miraculously was recovering from what most people die from. His mother, Alaina, used her fast-acting mom and nurse skills to contribute to the early interventions that gave him a fighting chance. Unfortunately, Connor developed a fast-acting pneumonia while hospitalized which spread to his bloodstream (sepsis).   Connor was re-intubated and once again fighting for his life. The NJ hospital recognized the critical nature of this illness and accepted they could no longer care for a child this ill. Connor was helicoptered to CHOP where they did everything they could to save his life. Due to lack of oxygen from multisystem organ failure (to make a long story short), Connor's brain suffered. Alaina and Dan made the hardest decision of their lives which was to end Connor's suffering and chose to save the lives of other children by donating Connor's organs. Heroes....an understatement. All of them. As my best friend and hero-mom is preparing to bury her only son, this go-fund-me has been established to help her with Connor's medical bills (3 weeks in the ICU at various hospitals not to mention a helicopter transfer), help with funeral costs (which no mother should have to endure), and help get her and her daughter, Brianna, back on their feet after enduring every mother's worst nightmare. Alaina, a single mother, has been out of work this whole time, and quite frankly deserves time with her daughter to heal and find a ""new normal"" once life calms down. Any help you can give is much appreciated. Trust me when I tell you, kindness is contagious and Alaina will surely give your kindness back to the word once her life calms down. My Baby Connor ..... you are our hero.

He also has a significant hole between the right and left ventricles as well as an enlarged pulmonary artery. Shortly after birth, Oakley had his first heart surgery where a stint was put on his artery, which was a temporary fix to give more time for his heart to grow bigger and stronger. He has now outgrown this stint and underwent his second open heart corrective surgery on May 25th at Boston Children's Hospital (a few days shy of his 1st birthday on May 31) in order to reroute the arteries and patch the hole. Early signs are that the surgery was successful and he is now beginning a long recovery process which will include an extended stay at the hospital for up to a month.  It has been an emotional and trying time for MaryEllen and her husband Shant, but they are doing their best to remain optimistic and praying for the best possible outcome. In response to the outpour of concern from many family and friends asking ""How can I help?"" knowing the amount of surgical expenses from little Oakley's first surgery still piling up and the inevitable amount of bills that will continue to come in that are not covered by insurance, we wanted to provide you all with this path to direct your love and support.

She has had at minimum 10 spinal taps to inject chemo into her spinal fluid to ensure the Leukemia can never travel to her spine and/or brain.  She has spent many a night in the hospital due to fever, dehydration, regular viruses that you and I could fight off easily and a terrible bout with c-diff. Emelina is doing amazing and has gone through all of this like a true warrior princess.  Her happiness and spunk are and always have been in full effect.  Her prognosis is wonderful and at the end of this journey she will be a happy, healthy, thriving 5 year old.  Please consider donating to her fight and to the family to aid in her hospital bills and travel expenses, as they will continue on this journey for the next two years.  No child should ever have to endure this and no parent should have to watch his or her child go through this without any control to take the pain away.  Thank you so much!!! #EmmatheBrave",388,735,20,391,1 month,6 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Doctors told his parents that this was not to be worried about but that they would do another scan in 5 years to check that it hadn't grown. About 2 months ago, Mikey asked if he could try out for football. His mom insisted that he couldn't until another MRI was done to check on his aneurysm. She had some convincing of his medical team to do because she wanted the scan done earlier than they had recommended but they got it done. What they discovered was an absolute shock... there was a new aneurysm, a fuseiform aneurysm in the basilar artery (middle of the brain stem) which was significantly larger in size than his original carotid artery aneurysm. His doctors and parents worked to figure out a plan for almost a month for this rare and difficult diagnosis. His parents were advised to come back in 3 to 6 months to do another check-up and discuss putting in a stent instead of risking surgery to remove the aneurysm from this delicate location.4 days later, on July 4th, Mikey suffered a stroke in his brain stem from a blood clot that had formed. No one could see the blood clot in CTs or an MRI until they did a CT with an angiogram and by then the damage was done. The doctors said it happened within 5 minutes and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. Mikey has been in the ICU ever since.He has now been diagnosed with Locked-In Syndrome with paralysis. This means that the damage done by the stroke in his brain stem has paralyzed him to the extent of no longer being able to move anything except his eyes, and only vertical movement and blinking at that. This is a paralysis that is rare and is unlikely to resolve. The Plan (so far) To provide him with any encouragement and support to recover any of his voluntary muscle movement that he can, (especially in his face and throat). Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy as soon as possible are a must in encouraging any of this recovery.His mom and step dad (Dezaree and Matt Corwin) are already working out the details to renovate their home so that Michael can come home and have the space and access for his supplies and comfort that he needs AFTER he has grown strong enough to be discharged from the ICU and successfully completes a stay in rehabilitation.However, there will be tremendous unforseen costs moving forward with Michael's care that include everything from communication devices, therapies, rehabilitation, etc.Can you help?Any amount of donation and/or support you can give is appreciated more than we can express. Or if you know of anyone or any treatment that we can look into to help our boy, please share your stories with us!PLEASE pass this information along to family, extended family, best friends, friends, friends of friends, charities, do-gooders, etc. in the area and beyond to put their positive vibes, prayers, experiences and donations toward this mighty feat to help our family provide the best support and comfort to him that we can in this life-changing moment.All you have to do is click the donate button above and/or share this link through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, text, etc. Thank you so much, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you.#unshakeableMikeyTrent #Mikeystrong",550,4.8k,38,534,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I started working with him, helping on bids and project management, trying to learn everything I could from him.He poured his heart and soul into his work; he cared more than anyone I have ever met. Anyone that knew Shea, knew that when he was right, he was right, and wouldn’t back down. He was warrior in his work and his life. And all the while, he lit up the room with his smile and warmed it with his kindness. As many know, Shea was diagnosed with a brain tumor in the Spring of 2012.He went through countless surgeries and chemo treatments, yet continued to work throughout it all.I’m pretty sure he had some kind of superman powers. But work was what he loved to do.This spring Shea’s cancer took a turn for the worse.He fought to continue, refusing to take rest or leave. He fought until he literally was unable to speak, until he physically could no longer work.In all his stubborn relentless commitment to his work, he cared more about contributing to the success of our division.To make matters worse, he was unable to qualify for any coverage due to his then established illness.As such, Shea and his family have had to fight this battle without any medical assistance whatsoever. Now, despite all his efforts to continue, he is no longer able to support himself or his family.Shea’s wife, Tasha, and their family need to be with him 24/7 now.With this little time Shea has left, there are medical costs accumulating. Shea is a strong, proud, hard-working man that would never ask for your assistance or support. Which is why I am. The hours we work, the heart and soul we pour in to these demanding roles, our work life is our family life, and Shea is family. I’m hoping that we all can come together as family, to help Shea, Tasha and his loved ones in covering the expenses this illness is costing them so they can focus on providing him with the love and support he deserves in his final days.I’m not asking for much, every little bit helps. All I ask is that you consider what it would be like if you were in his shoes, and show some compassion for a man that gave everything he had to help us all succeed.",189,226,0,190,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Medical,28,Kelsey and baby Maxley,https://www.gofundme.com/kelsey-and-baby-fergie,"PRIOR LAKE, MN","June 10, 2018","$100,000","$44,200","My sister, Kelsey, has been through more devastation in the last year than some people deal with in a lifetime.  First, Kelsey and Scott started trying for a baby as soon as they got married in March 2016, but after a year of negative pregnancy tests, they sought the help of a doctor who eventually put Kelsey on fertility meds.  Amazingly they helped and Kelsey was pregnant in July 2017.  Unfortunately in  August 2017, Kelsey and Scott got their first devastating news, they had lost the baby at about 9 weeks.  Kelsey went back on her meds when she was given the all clear from her doctor, and they were lucky to conceive again quickly. They announced to friends and family in November that they were expecting again, due in late July 2018.  They celebrated cautiously knowing what had happened the last time.  When they hit the 20 week mark, they felt relief having made it that far, and announced they were having a boy!  However during their 20 week ultrasound, the techs were not able to get all the images they needed, so Kelsey and Scott needed to go back in at 24 weeks for a follow up ultrasound.  It was during that appointment that their world came crashing down.  They were told that the baby had a heart defect, and that the baby was measuring almost 4 weeks behind in size.  Those 2 items are symptoms of a couple chromosomal abnormalities, and the specialist told Kelsey and Scott that it was very likely that he had an abnormality that would be fatal.  Most babies are stillborn, and if they do happen to make it to term, they dont survive long outside the womb.  Kelsey and Scott were devastated.  They both wanted nothing more than to be parents, and had been trying for 2 years at this point to make that happen. Doctors ran blood tests that day, and for a week while they waited for the results, they thought their dreams of this baby were gone.  However those results ended up coming back negative/low risk of the 5 most common abnormalities.  Kelsey and Scott's dreams were reignited.  Doctors determined Kelsey's placenta was not working like it should, so that was most likely the reason the baby was measuring small.  They then transferred her to Abbott for future tests and appointments. She was told that most growth restricted babies require extra monitoring, and that at some point she could get admitted to the hospital for constant monitoring.  It would help them determine exactly when the right time would be to take the baby out.  The longer they wait, the healthier the baby, but then if they wait too long then the baby could die from lack of blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.  Kelsey continued monitoring for several weeks.  However the weekend of June 1, at 32 weeks, Kelsey wasnt feeling the babies movement as much, so doctors gave her a shot of steriods and told her she will most likely have the baby by 34 weeks. On Monday June 4, doctors decided that it was time Kelsey be admitted to the hospital.  Scott helped get her checked in, and went home that night.  At this point, Scott had been dealing with multiple symptoms over the last several weeks, cough, body aches, fever, joint pain, etc.  He had seen a couple doctors, and had tried a few meds, but nothing had helped, and no one seemed to be sure exactly what was going on.  They thought he had rheumatoid arthritis, all the symptoms fit, and he had an appointment set up for that Wednesday to start treatment.  After Scott left Kelsey on Monday night though, he went home and he was having a hard time breathing, he could not stop coughing, and he even started coughing up blood. He drove himself the the ER in Shakopee, and they did Xrays and thought it was pneumonia.  They decided to transfer him to another hospital to see a lung specialist, they gave him a choice of Methodist or Abbott, and since Kelsey was at Abbott, they transferred him up there.Once he got checked in there, doctors determined he had a rare autoimmune disease called Vasculitis or Wegeners, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels. They started his treatment and on Wednesday he felt so much better.  Kelsey was able to visit him a few times a day on Tuesday and Wednesday.  On Thursday however, Scott was still not able to get his oxygen levels up and was still having difficulty breathing.  They wanted to try a few procedures to help, including putting him on lung bypass to help give his lungs a break.  Unfortunately during that procedure, Scott suffered cardiac arrest.  They were able to resuscitate him after 45 min, and after a long while they were able to transfer him up to the Cardiac ICU.  Kelsey was able to be with him, but doctors told her they were not able to stop the bleeding into his lungs, and there wasn't anything else they could do.  Scott passed away just after midnight on June 8th, at just 30 years old.Kelsey was still in the hospital for her high risk pregnancy, and after regular monitoring 3 times a day over the weekend, on Tuesday June 12, doctors determined it was time for her baby to meet the world, just 4 days after his daddy had passed away.  Maxley Russell Ferguson was born via csection at 11:56am on June 12, 2018 and he weighed just 2 pounds 4 ounces.  They had warned Scott and Kelsey that the baby would most likely need to be resuscitated after birth and intubated to help him breath, but little Maxley came out crying and never needed anything to help him breath. He is thriving in the NICU and is just cute as a button.  He will be in the NICU for several weeks as he learns to grow and regulate his own temperature, and once he learns to eat consistently, he will be able to go home, though doctors think that will still be closer to his due date at the end of July.  He will still require heart surgery for his heart defect (which they had learned was an AV canal defect) but doctors anticipate that surgery will be when Maxley is about 4-6 months old.What Kelsey is having to deal with right now, no one should have to go through that.  The birth of your child should be the best time of your life, instead, she is having to mourn the loss of her husband, plan a funeral, and care for her preemie baby in the NICU.  That is a lot for any one person to have to deal with. And obviously with the death of a spouse and parent, several financial burdens come with that.  This campaign is here to help my sister with all that comes with raising a child on her own, daycare costs, bills, not to mention the funeral costs that will come, and a new mortgage as Scott and Kelsey had JUST bought a new house in March after renting an apartment for several years, they wanted a home to raise a family in.Please consider donating what you can to help Kelsey and baby Maxley.  We cant take Kelsey's pain away, but we can help prevent additional burdens by helping her financially.Please visit both caring bridge pages for more detailed information for both Scott and baby Maxley. https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/scottrussellferguson https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/babyfergie",656,3.6k,7,616,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

This cancer does not yet have a cure and is very rare(only 200,000 cases per year). As everyone knows, Eric is just shy of 31 years old, looks like he is in the best health, always has a smile on his face, and has an energy about him that leaves an impression on everyone he meets. At the beginning of the year, Eric started developing pains in his abdomen and back. He started feeling tired and then caught a cold. They called/met with their doctor and got a z-pac for his symptoms. The cold went away. A week later, the pain started again and nausea developed. We thought it was his pancreas or gallbladder. After going to the ER they ran tests and said everything was fine, except a small mass that appeared in his liver that was  about 4 cms. They then met with a liver doctor and decided it would be best to get a biopsy and proceed with a liver resection if in fact it was a tumor while operating. During his surgery, the mass was found to be cancerous and when the doctor went in further he discovered multiple tumors and was diagnosed with Cholangiocarcinoma. The doctor could not resect the tumors due to the severity of it spreading. Eric and Danielle have been married just under 4 years and thought that IVF was their journey, however, God had other plans. While in the hospital recovering from his major surgery; Eric and Danielle found out for the first time in 3 years, that they were going to be parents. This was his first sign of hope to motivate him through his journey!Currently, Danielle and Eric are meeting with a team of doctors to determine the best treatment plan.  Eric needs to begin chemotherapy immediately in hopes to shrink the tumors to give the doctors an opportunity to go back in and resect areas of his liver. To begin treatment his jaundice levels need to reduce as well as clearance from his surgery he intially went under. It is expected that Eric will need multiple treatments, and WHEN the tumors cooperate, he can become a candidate for a liver transplant.We appreciate all the help we can get for our medical needs as Eric's fights this.  Thank you and God Bless!To get updates on Eric please follow the link below:Eric's Facebook GroupOther details about this Go Fund Me campaign:This campaign was created by Melissa Riegler, (Anaheim Hills, Ca) who is the sister of Danielle Augustine (Eric's wife) and sister in law of Eric Augustine.Danielle Augustine is the beneficiary for all funds raised for this campaign and is the only person who has the ability to withdraw any of the funds.All funds will go towards medical expenses for Eric.",373,1.9k,4,358,5 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,28,Jean Millington GO,https://www.gofundme.com/jean-millington-go,"GOSHEN, MA","March 16, 2018","$50,000","$44,160","My sister Jean has had a stroke, and needs our help. As most of you know, she is a bass player extraordinaire/singer and we started actually by playing ukeleles together as kids in the Philippines, and singing our hearts out (we are Philippine-Amercan). We moved to acoustic guitars, and then electric instruments with a band in high school (Sacramento, the 60's!). That morphed into the band Fanny, and although our paths diverged a few times, neither of us ever stopped playing. I just need to say that Jean is a national treasure in my opinion - few people can play as she does. And sing, while playing bass!When she had her stroke, it was also discovered that she has diabetes (runs in the family). So her care is complicated - she's home now, but needs continued care and physical therapy. The house has needed to be retrofitted ... and so on. Please give when and as you can and let other people know. You might be surprised at who might already know of Jean Millington through her rich musical history - and/or will be delighted to know of how she's already contributed so much to our joy and happiness by playing with so many - both live and on recordings.A new album has just been released with bandmate (and high school pal from our band the Svelts!), Fanny Walked the Earth: that's Jean, me, and Brie Darling - we need to all go out there and play together again!With endless thanks,June Millington*A note to all our friends: Jean's daughter Marita is the stated beneficiary to make it easier to manage the funds you are so gracously and lovingly donating - it's a joint account, to be clear, and all the funds are directed in such a way that Jean is fully involved. So much thanks!*Photo of Jean during a Svelts (our high school all-girl band) photoshoot at Santa Cruz around Spring of 1968. We were living in a band house in Los Altos at the time, playing as much as possible and learning all the time. Some of the songs on our setlist? ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and ""Spooky."" We did it all! (oh, yes, ""the Letter"" and ""Funky Broadway,"" too - not bad, to cut your teeth on! We loved every minute of our wild, musical freedom.The house where it all started, Portola Way in Sacramento, CA - photo courtesy Tamara Reynolds.At first, we had a bedroom on the first floor with 2 single, metal beds. When we got a transistor radio in there, we started to learn songs on acoustic guitars - those hits of the day were fantastic! (""We'll Sing In the Sunshine"" and ""End of the World"" come to mind). Then, the attic was renovated just enough for me and Jean to move up and into, and with that our world changed - we had privacy! (it had a trapdoor you could pull up ...). We even had full-on band rehearsals up there, with drums! One of the songs? ""Do You Believe in Magic?"" SURE  we did - we were living it! Later, Fanny did gigs with John Sebastian - we're in touch still. Now, THAT's magic.By 1965, we had started our first all-girl band, the Svelts, with drummer Kathie and fellow folksinger (we switched to electric guitars and bass pretty quickly!) Cathy. SO fun and exciting ... from left: Jean, drummer Kathie Terry, June, and singer-guitarist- Cathy Carter.Several personnel changes later, the Svelts included Brie Darling (née Berry) - who quit a year later but kept playing with us off and on anyway! She ended up at with us in Hollywood at our band house Fanny Hill, and after I left the band in '73 played on the very last Fanny album that had Fanny's biggest hit: Jean's song ""Butter Boy."" Talk about a Long and Winding Road! (drummer Alice de Buhr left shortly after I did, and both Brie and guitarist Patti Quatro joined the band - it was with a different producer and record company, but the band definitely, as the saying goes,  played on). 49 years later we were recording as Fanny Walked the Earth at IMA, a non-profit organizaton for women and girls in Goshen, MA! Here, Jean is shown entering the Control Room where her son, Lee, was working as one of the engineers. We were doing vocals for ""Girls on the Road,""  a sort of song diary of the early Svelts days:""Let's go back to where it all began: 17, then we started a band. Lugging our gear up and down the stairs, making so much noise, we didn' really care! Girls on the road, Girls on the Go, doing what we knew was gonna save our souls ... Riding the wave, coming 'round the bend, onece you feel the beat you got to do it again."" That's absolutely ALL true, and I love those lyrics - they're true to the soul and spirit of our times.We had done so many gigs between '65 and '68 that we felt seasoned and confident, ready for anything that came along. After all, we could back up a trailer and set up a PA ourselves! In top photo left: Brie, June, Cathy and Jean pose as the Svelts just after a personnel change - our manager Dick pasted Brie'a head over Kathie's; the band had to go on and we had no money for promo!We always wanted to play!During out first ""International"" tour - the Svelts, that is. We were kind of having a hard time as Brie quit the band just before we were to set off, and we had no real drummer - here, in Winnipeg, we followed a topless band called ""8 of a Kind,"" who had four band members. I think everyone was so excited at the thought of another topless band (we were not:)) that they barely noticed we were missing a drummer - Jean and Addie Clement, who was also in the Svelts for years (she tore it up on lead guitar and vocals) in their hotel room, in the doldrums. What was gonna happen? This was around July 1967.The Svelts, late Spring 1968 - our house in Los Altos. A nice moment, from left: Wendy Haas (keyboards/vocal), Jean, Brie, and June. Photo by Steve Griffith, thank you.The Svelts, late summer 1968 - nothing would stop us! By now, we'd magically  morphed into the group Wild Honey. In tree,  from left: Alice de Buhr, drums; Jean, bass/vocals ; Wendy, keyboards/vocals; June, rhythm guitar/vocals; and Addie Clement, lead guitar/vocals.Hollywood, finally! We got our record deal in the Fall of '68 with Richard Perry, producer/Reprise Records, and loved our house just above Sunset Strip (dig the landlord's castle, just beyond, complete with courtyard). Who cared about the smog? We promptly scoured the floors, cleaned the basement, installed lava lamps and candles down there with our equipment as a rehearsal lair, and named the house Fanny Hill - as soon as we re-named the band Fanny, which didn't take long. It was a girl's name, and we were gonna conquer the world!

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoLvdnToHMgA portion from my audiobook ""Land of a Thousand bridges,"" my autobiography. Here, I'm going to UC Davis'66-'67, in a band and learning theory for the first time.Ah well, for some reason I can't get that clip to play, but you got the link! Here's our very first busness card, created by the boy who sat in front of me in biology class at McClatchy High in Sacramento, where we'd moved from Manila in 1961. I wish I remembered his name!p.s. the best compliment we got back in those days was ""Not bad for chicks!"" We just smiled and dug in harder ...I love this shot - we literally climbed outside the back windows at Fanny Hill (it had been Hedy Lamar's house - believe me, electric! (look her up as an inventor) ...One of our very early rehearsals in the Fanny Hill living room - Jean bass, Alice de Buhr drums, June guitar. The doors behind us opened up to the porch that overlooked Sunset Strip just beyond. (this would be circa 1969).We would play our hearts out, anytime day or night. Here, we're tightening up an arrangement before heading down to the Whiskey a Go-go (not far from Fanny Hill, maybe 15 blocks down the strip) to play that night. From left: Nicky, Jean, Alice and June.When Nicky Barclay joined the band, pretty soon we were joined by piano and a B-3 organ. Our sound just kept getting bigger and bigger!As we hit the road in 1971, press was as important as people hearing us on records. Next: for them to hear and see us LIVE. Promotion was handled by Derek Taylor,  press officer to the Beatles who was at the time on leave and mostly in LA. He was for a time known as the ""Fifth Beatle,"" and I wouldn't argue with that. Truly one of the most iconic and magical people I ever met. (June)We did it all! Look Magazine, and ironic that we're looking through bars. We needed to bust through! From left: Jean, Alice, Nicky, and June.Jean practicing backstage at the BBC set for the Old Grey Whistle test, Dec 1971. We did the song ""You're the One,"" and people went crazy - even today, the reaction is off the charts. No wonder, it's starts with a closeup of Jean on her bass! We always made sure we warmed up before every appearance, whether live or on television. Playing Fanny material is not for wimps!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pukOcZ4Tjk0To hear Fanny backing Barbra live on ""Where You Lead,"" pls go to  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eGA_Abhvnc - you can hear Jean and me contibuting to the backup vocals at Verse 2: ""whoo-ooh-ooh""s. Definitely the Millington vocal sound!IN THE EARLY DAYS, THE BEST WE HEARD FROM AUDIENCES WAS ""Not bad for Chicks!"" BY THE TIME WE GOT TO PLAYING SCOTLAND, IN 1972, HORDES OF BOYS WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE STAGE CHANTING ""FAN-nny! ""FAN-nny! ""FAN-nny!"" louder & louder. WE HADN'T REALIZED THAT WORD MEANT SOMETHING COMPLETELY IN THEIR WORLD! BUT WE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY, AND LAUGHED RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.  AS LONG AS THEY WERE BUYING RECORDS ...More of that vocal sound on Ella Fitzgerald's version of ""Ooh Baby Baby""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pLTQAXx61E - 1969, and not only did we sing on this (with some earlier members of Fanny, which was called Wild Honey at the time), we watched her do the vocal. Early days LA for us, and meeting such an amazing singer, and public figure, who was so humble and real ... was a transcendent experience (we had the same producer, Richard Perry). THAT - is how you learn to record. xxJust as the first Fanny album was getting ready to be released, we did warm-up gigs to the big tours ahead, around LA. Here, at Knottsberry Farm.Jean at far left, mugging with our mom, our brother Richard and me on an outing in the Philippines, sometime in the 50's.40 years later, rehaearsal with our bad the ""Slammin' Babes,"" in Bodega California!

We spent so much time in airports, finally we just started mugging on the median strips!Jean with Danny Blakkolb, who'd popped by during a break from Vietnam. So, bopping around and going to music stores Hollywood? Heaven. Danny was the bass player in the Psy-kicks, with  whom we did a lot of gigs in Sacramento: same age, different sexes. But we got along just fine! The music was the thing ... hip, hip, Hooray for the innocent '60's! xxIt took a minute to get used to us ...When we got to London in Dec 1971 to record ""Fanny Hill"" at the Beatles' Apple Studio, they would send a limo for us every day. Our lives sure changed!While we were getting our sound and tour chops together,  Reprise/WB assigned us empty movie lot stages in which to rehearse. Here, Alice Jean and Nicky during a break. We got a lot of work done! (Fanny, circa Fall 1970, photo Linda Wolf).Our mom always remained our staunchest supporter!

This has been the recurring question we all want to know. While the Heines have greatly appreciated everyone’s prayers, meals, cards, and healing thoughts, it is now time to move to the next step of helping them financially.Brian, husband to Julie, and father to Mackenzie and Maddie, has always been a vibrant, quick-witted,  full of life, fun man. He knows no strangers.  In mid-January, Brian was leaving for a business trip and slipped on a patch of ice in the airport parking lot. He landed on his back, but luckily was wearing a backpack which broke his fall. Immediately after, Brian started having neck pain and thought it was from the whiplash of his neck during the fall.  Two weeks passed. Brian woke up on a Saturday morning and noticed his walking gait was different.  A quick trip to the Urgent Care showed scans and bloodwork were clear.  The Urgent Care told Brian to call his physician to schedule an MRI.  The next day, Brian's walk didn't improve, so he went to the E.R.at Missouri Baptist. After a 3-hour MRI, the radiologist misdiagnosed the results as cancer that metastasized . Brian was admitted to the hospital.  Brian and Julie were devastated.  Luckily, Brian's sister found information online about how cavernomas (lesions that several of his family members have) are often incorrectly diagnosed as cancer. They immediately informed Brian's nurse of this information and she consulted the doctors. After reviewing the MRI scans again, Brian was correctly diagnosed with familial cavernous malformations. They found 2 cavernous hemagiomas/lesions attached to his spinal cord at C3 and C4 near the brainstem. In order to receive the best care, Brian was transferred to Barnes where the amazing neurosurgeon, Dr. Chicoine, performed surgery. Dr. Chicoine removed 80% of the C4 lesion, but didn’t feel it was safe to operate on the C3 lesion. Unfortunately, post-surgery, the C3 lesion bled and created many challenges for Brian.  He has remained in the ICU since January 29th and has since had several procedures following surgery including a pacemaker, breathing tube, tracheostomy, and feeding tube.  Currently, Julie is on a leave of absence from her teaching job to be by Brian’s side. She is Brian’s biggest cheerleader and advocate. Between the two of them, Brian and Julie have always been there for others organizing benefit trivia nights, securing silent auction donations, and emceeing the events. It is now our turn to give back to them as a family. Brian, the ultimate life of the party, is currently immobile and can only silently mouth words to communicate. They just received word that Brian will begin rehabilitation at Craig Hospital in Denver, which specializes in helping spinal cord patients..  Any gift you can give will greatly help to defer the cost of current and future medical bills, and living expenses. Thank you all in advance, and Let’s Cover Their “Heine”!Follow Brian's journey at:  https://brianheinerecovery.blogspot.com Add your comments on the blog and I will be sure to read them to Brian.  He will love hearing from all of his supporters!",324,952,3,327,5 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

This is the only option left to Anna, after 19 years of living with Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). PH is a progressive and terminal illness that impacts both the lungs and the heart, growing more severe with time. Despite a daunting prognosis at the age of four, Anna was responsive to intravenous therapies, which are delivered directly to her heart through a central line 24/7. Although her health has instilled many significant limits upon her life, Anna’s days have been filled with faith, wonder, and community. After finishing high school, Anna’s illness continued to progress, and it became clear that her medications would no longer be enough to sustain her long term. At this time, she was accepted as a candidate for heart-lung transplant at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Without knowing what would come next, Anna began college and continued to push forward. Through four years of hard work and frequent doctor’s visits with her transplant team, Anna was able to graduate in 2017 with a nursing degree from Bethel University. Since finishing college last year, Anna’s health has continued to decline. After a full year spent developing a plan of care with her transplant team, Anna and her family have decided that her best chance for organs is at Stanford Medical center, in California. Now that Anna is listed at Stanford, it is unknown how long she will have to wait for the right match. In this time before surgery, Anna and her family are facing months of many overwhelming financial burdens, including rent and medical costs associated with care prior to transplant. After surgery, the financial pressure will only increase as they face the cost of hospital bills, many new medications, flights for family members so that relief support can be provided, and additional assistance for Anna so that she may lead an independent and productive life as she recovers in the year following transplant. ANY help during this time is incredibly appreciated. Unfortunately, transplant is not a cure-all for Anna’s condition. While she will no longer be living with PH, she will be a transplant patient for the rest of her life. This will bring forth a whole new set of risks and concerns. With that said, Anna’s new organs will allow her to live life in a new way. Her physical endurance will hopefully be greatly improved, so that Anna will be able to travel, hike, and exercise in ways that have never been an option to her in the past 19 years. Ultimately, Anna and her family are optimistic about the second chance at life that a heart-lung transplant could provide.Despite the chaos of this year, Anna’s faith in God throughout this process is unwavering, and she is fortified to know that He is walking with her always. If you are not able to contribute financially, please know that prayer is just as precious to Anna and her family in this season. Please lift her name up, and please share her story so that she can continue to be an outlet of light and hope for others. While Anna has been unable to begin pursuing a career as a nurse, she has instead chosen to push towards her calling as an artist and a writer. If you are looking for another way to support Anna, her artwork can be found for purchase on her website ( www.annalisabeth.co), or at GOLDEN RULE in Excelsior, MN.",197,1.6k,2,191,29 days,13 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

While in her early twenties, Kendra was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was in remission when she met her future husband Travis.  After 15-plus years of marriage, Kendra and Travis have a steady partnership and continue to be everyone’s favorite couple to be around whether on the ballfield cheering on one of the boys or sitting in the audience of a school play. Kendra and Travis, who served in the US Air Force, have lived in Northern Virginia since 2000. Kendra inspires many of us - not only by how bravely and fiercely she’s fighting cancer for the second time, but also for the loving, accepting Christian she is in everyday life, for the fun and playful mom she is to four active and kind boys, for the devoted and caring daughter, sister, friend and wife she is.

It was only four days ago when they finally did a lung biopsy and discovered he actually has lung cancer. Had they discovered the cancer sooner, he might not be in this life or death situation. They took a year and a half of his life, now we’re trying to give him back his future.Bo has spent the better part of his life protecting the people of Arizona and America, it’s our turn to protect him. He needs all of us to join together to help him fight this horrible disease by donating to his medical fund. Any donation helps, big or small.

On April 16 th, Rio was skiing Squaw Mountain in Lake Tahoe where he suffered a spinal cord injury, fracturing C5 and C6 vertebrae’s in his neck. Rio was transported to Renown Medical Center in Reno and underwent spinal surgery followed by 9 days in the ICU. Through donations and many helping hands, Rio was medically transported to Craig Rehab Hospital in Denver, CO for intense rehabilitation. At this point Rio has movement in his right arm, limited in his left arm and is working on weaning off the ventilator. Because the injury is new, we’re praying for great strides to be made during his rehabilitation. Prior to Rio’s accident he was working as a travel nurse. Rio was not content performing required nursing duties and strived to raise the bar. Outside of work he often helped the less fortunate in the community. The stories of his kindness have been overwhelming. Although he would deny it, his kind heart has touched many people.We are now asking for your generosity to allow Rio continued care at Craig Hospital. During his rehabilitation, Craig will aggressively work with himphysically and psychologically. He does have insurance, but as most know, that only goes so far. Rio’s greatest chance at regaining physical function and generalhealth is to stay at Craig Hospital for one year. Rio’s insurance will cover only minimal physical and occupational therapy.

He tries with everything he has to get his body moving. Today they will do a swallow evaluation. We need his nasal tube out so he can be transported. That tube is feeding him now. We give him full body massage 2 x’s a day, pray around him and do a lot of energy work. He loves to read his email & text msgs. He’s on top of his care - he knows every med he’s given (the 5 rights- nursing language). He’s requested a lot of alternative treatments and herbs to reduce inflammation, promote stomach health and nerve pain - of course he gets turned down. No problem if he wants oxycodone or morphine, but god forbid if he wants B12. He cried and cried when he saw gofundme. He said “people are good”. The most amazing thing is that it will get him transported to Denver! Thank you, thank you! We’ll know more tomorrow when that will happen. Please, please keep praying for Rios lungs to start breathing on their own and we’ll set our goal higher after that one! #Riostrong. We love you all!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------Update #2 from Saturday, April 21st,I just got off the phone with Tawni, and my good friend Rio. How encouraging that was. Today hasn't been easy, but they're staying incredibly strong during the ""push through,"" and pushing through, they are. Rio has very much enjoyed the text messages that everyone has been sending him. He has his phone propped up in an area where he is able to read them. Please continue to send him your love and text messages. It helps to get him through.Rio's phone number is 208-899-9312. Please share it with his friends.---------------------------------------------------------Update from GoFundMe, Saturday April 21st.(Please see Tawni's latest update from Yesterday below this update)

This is amazing.  Rio's campaign has been noticed and is now under verification review by GoFundMe. This doesn't affect anything, they're just working on some details on the backend for verification purposes.

The verification review comes because of the tremendous love, support, and backing you have shown towards Rio.  There are many thousands of GoFundMe's that get created everyday, however they don't typically get this kind massive notice. GoFundMe has specifically recognized this.  Rio, and the Peterson Family have clearly made a massive impact on us all.

As part of the verification process GoFundMe has asked me to clarify a few things.

First, my name is Tony Agenbroad from Nampa, ID.  I still drive by the Peterson's old Nampa house everyday.  The house is looking great guys.I'm Radley's age, and grew up with the boys, and the Peterson family.  From elementary school, church, 4H pigs, ski trips, camping trips, college and beyond, I've been blessed to have been able to spend so much quality time with the Peterson Family.The funds from this campaign will be used to medically transfer Rio from Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV, to Craig Institute in Denver, CO.  Craig specializes in spinal chord trauma and rehabilitation.  It's where the magic happens.  Tawni has said that it is vital that we get him there. Denver is over 1,000 miles away from Reno. 

We will work with Hobie and Tawni, Rio's parents, as a part of securing the funds.  Words cannot thank everyone so much for your love and support.  Please stay strong. We know you will.Let's get Rio to Denver.

#RioStrong

-----------------------------------------------------Update from Tawni, Friday, April 20thHere we are on day 4. A bit of a roller coaster with more ups then downs. The High 5 foundation that supports injured athletes came in and met with Rio/us yesterday. It gave us the boost we needed. Rio’s intubation tube was removed and he was given a Trach for ventilation breathing. That’s given him tons of comfort plus we’re becoming good at lip reading. Tuesday he acquired ventilator pneumonia so he’s currently fighting that. A representative from Craig Rehab hospital is flying in Monday to meet with us. Because of the gofundme donations Rio has received, he’s got some money to be medically transported. It’s incredible to think this is becoming a reality. He could be transported as early as next week to their vent unit. Please pray that Rio comes off the vent and his lungs start working on their own. We’ll move on from there— baby steps! In the meantime, every person that comes to his room has to hug him, he thanks everyone and often will mouth, “you the man”. Continue to send the positive thoughts and prayers. We need them more now than ever.------------------------------------------------------------Update from Thursday, April 19th.Thank you SO very much to all of you, and the incredible amount of support EVERYONE has shown.  The Petersons can feel it, and it's positive energy like this that will make all the difference. Right now a priority is to get Rio to Craig Institute in Denver, CO. Craig Institute specializes in Spinal Chord injury.  It is the place Where the Magic Happens. It will not be easy to get Rio to Craig.Rio has some movement and sensation in his upper body.  He has some ability to move his arms, and we hope and pray that this will continue to improve. This is amazing progress so far.He is aware of the love of his family and friends that surround him, even from many miles away.  He is in good spirits, even sharing some ""brotherly love"" with Radley and Rabon, who have both made it down to Reno.Rio's accident happened on Monday, at Squaw Valley Ski Resort.  He was then transported to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, NV. Right now, Rio's mailing address is: Renown Medical Center, C/O Rio Peterson1155 Mill St. Reno, NV 89502 Rio PetersonSierra Intensive Care Unit Rm 110Throughout this week I (Tony), was approached by many different people talking about this campaign.  Everyone approached me saying the same thing. Everyone is saying ""It's crazy that the campaign is getting this kind of traction! With that though, I'm not surprised because Rio and The Peterson's are such great people."" I too am not surprised by the overwhelming support.  You all have been great.Please continue to share what you can and send your positive thoughts.  Let's get him to Denver, and let this Magic Happen.With much love, on behalf of The Peterson's -- thank you, everyone.-----------------------------------------------------------------Post from Monday, April 16thStarting a GoFundMe with some bad, yet hopeful news.

Our good friend Rio Peterson was in a skiing accident today, and has a spinal injury.  He fractured his C5-6 vertebrae, and what happens this  next week will be crucial to his healing.

The Peterson family is the most humble, and positive, family I know.  I've always felt their support, and I know there are a lot of us who can say the same.

We are raising funds for the Peterson family to be with Rio.  Please contribute what you can, and please always keep your thoughts positive.  Prayers for Rio",406,1.5k,0,422,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The newlyweds planned to enjoy their honeymoon in Spain a few days after their vows; however, their plans were interrupted due to an unexplainable and excruciating pain in Yelena’s left leg. Instead of a honeymoon, the couple visited the hospital several times with an unsuccessful diagnosis of her condition. Six days after her wedding, Yelena was unable to move her left leg, so Alfredo and Yelena’s mother drove her to the emergency room. Within hours of arriving at the emergency room, doctors discovered Necrotizing Fasciitis a flesh eating bacteria rapidly advancing through her leg.  An amputation was the only option to rid her body of the infection. This infection can be deadly, so immediate action had to be taken to save Yelena’s life. Newlyweds, Yelena and Alfredo, were not prepared for a tragedy like this. Yelena will need a prosthetic leg and intensive rehabilitative therapy, so she can live her life like she did before this tragedy. A marriage should not start with such a tragic experience and unexpected medical bills.  Yelena loves to dance, so we are hoping she can go straight to dancing soon after her recovery. Yelena is disciplined, dedicated, and determined. When she wants something, she goes after it.

The bills have begun rolling in and the family will be financially responsible for  long-term care within a week or so. (Fun fact: private helicopter rides are billed at $30,000!!!)  Any donations received will assist in the payment for treatment, any related costs incurred, and the upkeep of the Lichtenberger household.  Our family greatly appreciates any help you are able to give.  Keep praying for Carol, please, and we wish everyone peace and love.",193,290,0,198,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Needless to say, it has the possibility of affecting every organ in his body at any moment.  The care plan includes immediate and aggressive treatment with chemotherapy starting this Thursday, March 15th, 2018.  Art is presently battling high fevers and feeling very physically weak, not to mention emotionally and mentally drained about how his life has just been turned upside down.  He is overwhelmed beyond anything any of us can imagine after receiving such a devastating diagnosis.  If you know Art, you know him to be strong, funny, caring, and one of the most generous people you have ever met.  He is a doting dad to his twin daughters, Alyssa and Kalynn.  He is the eldest son of Auntie Rose and Uncle Art, protective older brother to Ryan and Lisa, and a great cousin and friend to so many people.  If you have ever heard of, or eaten at GrubShack in San Jose, you have most likely run into or spoken to him. To help Art during his time of need, we have set up this GoFundMe fundraising page and ask all those who know and care about Art to please pray hard for him, and if you are able, please donate any amount, big or small.  It will help greatly with enormous medical care and treatment costs not covered by insurance, living expenses, and various bills while Art's ability to work is indefinitely put on hold.We thank you all very much for taking the time to read about Art's situation.  Our ""Doctolero Ohana"" will continue to do our best to care for him, and with your help, it will certainly alleviate his mental anguish due to anticipated financial costs.   Your help and support will allow him to focus on getting through the chemo treatments, healing quickly, staying positive, and fighting his cancer to get back to a normal, healthy life.Thank you very much in advance.  We hope your generosity will come back to you tenfold!Warmest Regards,The Doctolero FamilyArt has authorized his aunt, Lita Doctolero-Tang, to manage the donation withdrawals from this fundraising campaign into a beneficiary bank account especially set up for Art.",245,1.2k,4,207,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Scoliosis is a disorder that causes an abnormal curve of the spine, or backbone and Ava’s curve was measured at 65 degrees. Because she is only 10 years old, there is great concern that the curve will continue to advance as she goes through puberty, resulting in alifelong disfigurement in her spine, discomfort and potential impacts on her lungs.Since being diagnosed, Ava has undergone a series of weekly                      non-surgical treatments, including a 2 week intensive care program in Orlando Florida over her Christmas Break. She has also been outfitted with a corrective brace that she currently wears 22 hours each day. Ava has traveled to the Shriners Hospital in Philadelphia, PA, as well as,several medical facilities in Georgia and Florida in search of the best treatment options going forward. To this point, health insurance hasnot covered any of Ava’s treatments and all expenses for treatment and travel have been paid out of pocket, creating a financial burden for the family.Looking ahead, Nemours Childrens Hospital in Jacksonville Florida offers a surgical procedure known a Vertebral Body Tethering that helps correct Scoliosis while still allowing for normal growth andflexibility of her spine. She has been scheduled for surgery May 9th.At this time the family is unsure how much their financial responsibilities will be for surgery and recovery but the current out of pocket costs for her treatments and pre-operative care are $25,000.Thank you in advance for your donations to help cover these costs and get Ava Grace on the road to recovery.Added by Jennifer to update for gofundme to be used correctly:

Your contributions will go directly to ensuring that Orrin receives the care he needs to recover from a series of spinal infections that have caused him to lose the ability to walk, and for my Mom to be able to provide for his care while she undergoes chemotherapy for Stage 3 colon cancer. Mom and OrrinMom and Orrin met while they were both students at USC in the early 1970s. Orrin was a baseball player, and Mom was a musical theater actress in the theater program. While at USC, Orrin helped the team to 4 national championships, and is currently in the USC sports program hall of fame. Mom performed in numerous productions while at USC, including the West Coast premiere of The Who’s rock opera Tommy. After college, Orrin became a baseball coach. He coached at UC Santa Barbara, San Francisco State, and Sonoma State, before becoming a scout for the MLB. Orrin joined the Florida Marlins as a scout at the team’s inception in 1991 and has been with the team ever since. In his 27 years as a member of the Marlin’s franchise, he has helped the team win two world series titles and, in 2014, was awarded both Scout of the Year by Major League Baseball and received a lifetime achievement award from the Major League Baseball Scouting Association.After college, Mom graduated from law school and earned her Masters degree in Education and School Administration. She taught elementary school for 25 years in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and also became a Vice Principal and Principal at several schools before retiring in 2007. She continued to act and sing, performing with the Riverside Master Chorale, the Redlands Footlighters, the Riverside Community Theater, and many other productions.30 years after dating while at USC, Mom and Orrin reconnected, and were married in 2007.OrrinIn January of 2018, mom found Orrin incapacitated in his armchair. A lifelong diabetic, Orrin’s blood pressure had spiked and metastasized into a bacterial infection in his spine. He was hospitalized and intubated into a medical coma. Doctor’s found that he was too ill to receive an operation that would have given him a good chance of walking again, and in the meantime his insurance kept moving him from facility to facility. He can only be transported via medical transport (ambulance), and has been moved between the hospital, Skilled Nursing Facilities, and Assisted Living Facilities since January. His insurance also had him discharged from his Skilled Nursing Facility, determining that he was not making sufficient progress towards recovery due to “a possible problem with his brain”.Additionally, Orrin faces a difficult decision: he can undergo a full back reconstructive surgery due to the extensive damage done to his back by infection.  This is incredibly risky, but, if successful, would give him a much better change of walking again. If it fails, it would leave him in extensive pain without regaining the ability to walk. The other option is a spinal fusion procedure, which would potentially greatly reduce the amount of pain he is in, but would likely confine him to a wheelchair. Because of his condition, we are unsure whether or not Orrin will be able to return to work. Though he has been in Major League Baseball since 1982 and is entitled to a pension upon retirement, he must work until he is 70 to receive his full pension. He is currently 68 and a half, and may never work again, so while he is able to draw from his pension, he must do so at -48% what he would have received if he’d worked until the retirement age of 70. MomMy mom, Penny Freeman, has been Orrin’s caregiver and advocate since the day he entered the hospital. She’s there nearly every day, making arrangements, ensuring he’s attended to, and arranging his transportation to and from doctor’s appointments and various facilities via ambulance. In March 2018, that all changed.In March 2018, Mom was hospitalized in need of a blood transfusion. Though the transfusion initially helped, a couple weeks later she was hospitalized a second time. A diagnostic revealed that she had Stage 3 Colon Cancer, and though she had surgery to remove the cancerous growth in the colon, a biopsy revealed that the cancer had spread and she would need to undergo chemotherapy. She starts chemo on June 5th, and will have to be infused every two weeks until November. While her oncologist is confident that the chemotherapy will eradicate her cancer, the chemo itself will weaken her body and seriously lower her ability to fight off sickness and infection during the 5 months of treatment.While doctors had initially thought they had the infection under control, a recent test revealed that Orrin has a resurgence of infection in his spine. Because chemotherapy will drastically compromise her immune system, she is not allowed to be near Orrin until the infection is under control, meaning she cannot accompany him to doctor’s appointments.The NeedOrrin has exhausted his skilled nursing benefit through his insurance plan, so last month they had to pay $13,000 cash for him to be cared for. Because Mom is not allowed to be near Orrin while her immune system is compromised, he has been moved to an assisted living facility at a rate of nearly $6,000 a month. Because he is not able to ambulate or walk, or even sit up without intense pain, he has to be transported to and from doctor's appointments via ambulance, and since mom cannot accompany him, they must also pay someone to accompany him to and from doctor's appointments, all of this also out of pocket. This arrangement will have to continue for the foreseeable future. They are trying to keep their heads above water, while navigating the treatment and hopeful recovery process of their respective ailments.It has been a year marked by personal catastrophe after personal catastrophe. With both Mom and Orrin suffering serious, life-threatening health complications in the same year, compounded by a serious change in financial circumstances, has made their plan to “weather the storm” not exactly go to plan. Life, as they knew it, has changed drastically in such a short period of time, and at the moment they are in survival mode, trying to get both of them the care they need while ensuring they have the proper environment for recovery.

Medical,29,Help Teresa with brain cancer ,https://www.gofundme.com/help-7-year-old-teresa-beat-cancer,"SELLERSVILLE, PA","March 5, 2018","$50,000","$43,124","Teresa Sensinger of Perkasie, PA, daughter of Andrew and Michelle Sensinger is battling brain cancer. The family is requesting donations to help with mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses. Please read Teresa’s story below:Early in May of 2017, Teresa Sensinger was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. She underwent surgery but due to the tumor’s location, total removal was not possible. From there, Teresa underwent vigorous physical therapy along with high dose chemo and radiation therapies. Her surgery had left her with some physical deficits, but her positive spirit was unwavering. By August, Teresa was able to come home from the hospital just in time to celebrate her seventh birthday with family and friends. Through the summer and fall, her doctors continued with the most aggressive treatment options possible to prevent the reoccurrence and spread of the cancer cells. Unfortunately, by fall of 2017, the doctors found that the tumors had returned. Through the help of the “Make-A- Wish Foundation”, Teresa was able to walk the beautiful beaches of Florida, visit Sea World, Disney, the Kennedy Space Center, and visit with family in Georgia.After returning home from her trip, Teresa continued with her chemo treatments. In January, a follow up scan revealed several new tumors extending down her spine. Her doctors determined that as aggressive as the chemo was, it just wasn’t working. The medical team decided to discontinue the chemo, and began a palliative course of radiation. Teresa completed this last course of treatment on February 20th, but was readmitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) just two days later with nausea and uncontrollable headaches. Her doctors have worked tirelessly searching for treatment options to give her relief. At that time, Teresa was experiencing severe balance deficits and had lost most of her hearing, and later her ability to speak, but the hope was that these were side effects of the radiation and would subside with time.This past Friday, Teresa’s parents, Andrew and Michelle, sat down with their team of doctors and received the worst news any parent could imagine. The latest scan showed the tumor had now wrapped around Teresa’s brain stem and there was nothing more they could do. This coming Tuesday, the hospital will be transporting her back home under hospice care, where she can be surrounded by her family and loved ones. Due to mounting medical bills and out of pocket expenses not all covered by insurance, the family is requesting donations to alleviate the financial burden on Andrew and Michelle. Remember, every little bit helps and no contribution is too small as we read in Mark 12: 41-44.The family also requests your prayers during this difficult time. All donations will be given to the Sensinger family, Michelle and Andrew.￼￼￼￼￼￼",652,3.0k,17,673,6 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have Secondary Progressive MS, which is an aggressive form of the disease where I am able to enjoy some periods of relief and partial recoveries. Five years ago my friends got together to raise money for an alternative oxygenation treatment in Guayaquil.  I  was blown away by the love and support that I received from friends all across the globe that in many cases I hadn’t spoken to in years.  It was so uplifting and a huge motivation for me and I am forever grateful.  I will never be able to express how truly therapeutic the support and love was for me in that very dark time of my life.The oxygenation treatment was initially a success. I experienced an incredible improvement in mobility of my limbs, especially in my left side which is the side most affected by the disease.   A short time after the treatment was complete, however, I suffered a very strong relapse.  The journey since has been a difficult one.  I have alternated between alternative and traditional medicine and treatments. Although I have experienced some improvements from time to time, generally they were always followed by strong relapses and eventually I have ended up primarily in a wheel chair with very little mobility in my legs.  This past September it became increasingly difficult to do things on my own, it got to a point where I needed help doing everything including going to the bathroom.  I’ve learned how horrible it is to have to depend completely on people to help me even in the simplest of tasks.  At the beginning of this year I started seeing a Bio Energetic doctor.  Through his treatments, which include neural therapy, homeopathy, acupuncture, magnetic therapy as well as brain training we have managed to not only stabilize my regression but I have also regained a lot of energy and mobility to the point where I am once again able to restore some of my independence and do things on my own.  For the first time in a long time I have hope again.  I believe God has given me a second chance of life.I would like to continue the treatments with my current doctor which are helping me so much.  Unfortunately the situation in Ecuador is very difficult and health insurance doesn’t cover alternative treatments .  So I am here humbly asking for your support again.   Anything you can give will be greatly appreciated and if you cannot help, please don’t feel bad.  I appreciate your love and support just as much.  I am hoping as I get better that I will be able to make it to Miami and even NY and hope to see you all soon. With love,Reg",114,269,2,115,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

Thank you. It means so much.Others have asked if they can still assist. Because things happened so quickly they didn't have time to respond. All I can say is we are walking a road we've never traveled and costs may exceed what we might have imagined. This surgery will cost over a million dollars.  We are thankful for insurance, however he will need to meet deductables, co-pays, etc, not covered by insurance. My father's post surgery meds may range from 5-9k a month (insurance covers up to 70%).  Whatever he receives in donations will be helping out immensely.______________David, has had a persistent cough. In the fall of 2016 it worsened noticeably. Justifiably concerned, he took his concern to a litany of doctors to ascertain the issue. The search came to an end in late November with a difficult diagnosis. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis was the cause. This condition is terminable. The only hope for survival, with any quality of life was to qualify for and undergo surgery for a lung transplant. Our family was, and is, stunned.With this devastating news,  we began to research in order to determine the best place to receive the transplant. The answer was the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. David began the work of getting on the list. Without going into detail suffice it to say this is an arduous task. The encouraging news is that he has now finally been put on the transplant list for both the Cleveland Clinic and the University of Pittsburg Hospital.And that is what leads to my request for your help.You see our family lives in Coral Springs, Florida and while insurance pays for much of the medical costs many of our needs are formidable and out of pocket. We will need to establish a temporary residence near these cities. We hope to be able to travel from our full-time home to spend time as caregivers for our dad. Someone must be with him 24 hours a day. He is now on oxygen around the clock. Medication costs that are not covered by insurance are beginning to add up. Even after the procedure is completed it is required to stay close to the hospital in case of complications. He will be enrolled in a pulmonary rehab for two months following the surgery. This cost, too, is not covered by any insurance. We will live near the hospital part time and commute to our home part time. Obviously, this has altered our existence and placed extensive hardship on our family. But with grace we will survive. Together,  we will have it covered, will get it done, and pour our best into this as one family team.Would you be willing to help us through this medical crisis by providing a financial contribution to assist us with lodging and transportation during this season? When all is said and done we estimate it will cost somewhere around $26,000 to meet these expenses. It seems formidable, but we hold onto hope for the future.  Any gift would be greatly appreciated. Join our team. With many on the team, we are confident we can pull through. Thank you so much for your consideration. We will keep you posted about the progress as we move forward.This page was created by Ericka Underwood, the eldest daughter of David Underwood. Donations will cover:1.

He was having a lovely day with family at the beach in Florida, playing with his nephew in the water, when he was rolled by an unexpectedly large wave. He must have hit his head extremely hard and lost consciousness, we are not sure for how long. His nephew pulled him from the water and his father gave him CPR to pump seawater and sand from his lungs. He has been unable to breathe unassisted since then and we’re uncertain if he gained consciousness although it’s possible he did open his eyes at some point before going to the ER. He was rushed to the ER as a near-drowning victim where they discovered he had several fractured vertebrae. He is currently in a medically induced coma and has been in surgery for 8 hours. Information we have:His C1 and C7 vertebrae are fractured, C4 broke into the spinal cord, C2 is shattered, there may be skull fractures, and the spinal cord is severed. The surgery (expected to be over 8 hours long) is intended to prevent further damage and Don will be kept in a medically induced coma for an undetermined amount of time to try to promote as much healing as possible. Doctors are not yet sure of brain activity or possible damage, partly because they do not know how long he was unconscious underwater. They think maybe as long as 4 minutes. The prognosis is that the spinal cord cannot be mended so the best-case scenario has Don being a quadriplegic which would be irreversible. The next challenge for him to overcome will be to see if he can breathe on his own, which is unknown at this time. It could be as long as several weeks while Don is in a coma before anyone knows whether or not he can breathe without a ventilator.As you can imagine this is a devastating time for both Donald and Kelly, she’s a warrior for sure but the scenario is taxing all of her resources emotionally and financially. She has just left for Florida to be with Don and his family.

For those of you who know both Krist and Tasha, know that this time has been very challenging for them. They need our help. Krist was diagnosed in  April 2017 with a rare type of cancer; Ampula Of Vater. A tumor growing on his ampula blocked the common bile duct. Krist went in for a Whipple Procedure 3 weeks after his diagnosis to remove the tumor and then started a very difficult chemotherapy treatment from June 2017 through September. In September, Krist got very sick from a blood infection so the doctors decided to stop the chemotherapy as they knew it would be too hard on his body during that time. While Krist had been battling this blood infection, Tasha went in for an MRI that month upon finding a lump in her breast. Tasha was diagnosed with Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. The doctors opted for a double mastectomy, 8 chemo treatments and 28 radiation treatments. Just 5 months later, in Feb 2018, it was found that Krist’s cancer had metastasized to his liver. He went through more chemotherapy that went through the end of June 2018. The doctors said at that point that they have exhausted chemotherapy options at the facility. They suggested that he be a part of a trial at the University of Chicago of Medicine. During that same week they went to the Block Center for another opinion for treatment for both hormone replacement therapy for Tasha and other medical options for Krist. The day after the appointment at the Block Center, Krist ended up in the hospital with jaundice. He needs to get his bilirubin numbers down and figure out what the next steps are. 

Over the last year combined, Tasha and Krist have been indebted with medical bills. Please help this beautiful family. There is no amount too small. Every little bit will help take the financial stress off their plates while they continue to get treatment. Please keep this beautiful family in your prayers.

I was living the best year of my life.  Suddenly, at the beginning of June, I had an excruciating onset of abdominal pain and swelling.  I was rushed to the emergency room where a CT scan revealed I had tumor in my pancreas, enlarged ovaries, and fluid in my abdomen. I was immediately admitted to the hospital, and after 10 days of evaluation, a biopsy of my pancreas revealed that I had a neuroendocrine carcinoma, an advanced and extremely aggressive form of cancer that almost never affects people my age. I was transferred to M.D. Anderson so I get could the best care for my type of cancer.  I was told I would need 6 cycles of chemotherapy over the next four months.  My insurance will only cover approximately half of the medical costs of chemotherapy, bloodwork, imaging, and medical follow-up. Adding to the challenge of this financial burden, the treatment must be paid for up-front.  I need your help to meet the additional $200,000 of uncovered medical costs.  I personally paid for my first round of chemotherapy/ imaging, and will have another payment due August 1, 2018.

Not only did he have leukemia, but he learned at just 23 years old, that he had two types of leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Since that day he has beaten all odds to be here with us today. He has had a bone marrow transplant, hip replacement, neurological issues and countless other trials. Any complication and side effect that could come from the transplant, chemo, medications, etc., it seemed like Tripp would fall victim. Today is no different. His current battle is due to Graft vs. Host Disease of the lungs.  Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD) of the lungs is caused by the new blood cells in his body, from the bone marrow transplant (the graft), attacking his lungs (the host).  GVHD can usually be controlled with different medicines, but in his case, the damage to his lungs was too severe before it was brought under control.   This caused irreparable damage to his lungs.  Despite many treatment plans, he is now at the point of requiring a double lung transplant.  Due to Tripp’s medical history caused by the leukemia and complications related to treating that disease, there are a limited number of facilities that would even consider him for transplant.  Duke University Hospital is the largest lung transplant program in the Southeast taking on more difficult cases like Tripp’s.  

Over 4 and half years ago, I saw my dad cry for the first time. I am starting this GoFundMe page to help four of the most important people in my life: my brother, my mother, my father, and my brother’s fiancé, Christine. In just a few weeks, my brother, mother (as his required caretaker), and Christine are temporarily relocating to Durham, North Carolina so Tripp can start the lung transplant program at Duke University Hospital. They will be in Durham for up to one year while Tripp receives and then heals from his lung transplant.  Although Tripp does have medical insurance, it doesn’t cover all the medical attention and therapy he will require pre-transplant and post-transplant. They will also have relocation, rent and living expenses for up to one year – none of which are covered by insurance.  This next year will be a very trying time for him, my mother, Christine and my father - as he will have to stay in Florida.

I am asking for your support to help my brother through this difficult time and to reduce the financial stress on my family. Any little bit helps, and we are beyond grateful for any generosity you are willing to give. In addition to any financial generosity, we ask for your prayers. God has already delivered Tripp through more complications than you could imagine. God is faithful and we are trusting in Him.",374,1.2k,0,368,9 days,7 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Back Story 

I had been having chest and back pain for quite a while. In October 2017, I was admitted to the hospital and tests showed a mass in my right lung. 

A biopsy in November showed it was benign. Since it wasn't cancer and surgery to remove it would mean months out of work, we decided to try to shrink the mass with medication. Unfortunately, the pain didn't get better. As the months went by, it got worse and worse. It got to the point where I couldn't sleep and I was coughing up blood. 

In June of this year, I went to St. Luke's emergency room and was admitted for many, many tests. My pet scan showed ""activity"" in two different areas of my lung, plus a muscle under my ribcage. Alarmingly, the original mass had grown a great deal in a short time. Doctors performed multiple biopsies. 

Diagnosis 

On July 9, my wife and I were given news that shocked us to our core: I have cancer. Spindle cell sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects bone, muscle, and connective tissue. Sarcoma is difficult to treat under the best of circumstances, but when it has spread like mine has, the prognosis is much worse. 

Treatment 

Conventional doctors are recommending chemotherapy to try to shrink the largest mass before removing it and a large portion of my right lung, and then possibly radiation. All of these treatments are expensive and painful. Worse, their success rate against cancer like mine is low. 

A Safer Alternative

I have researched and found a clinic in Mexico that has successfully treated sarcoma using nutritional therapy and other treatments, such as: 
*Oxygen therapy 
*Rife therapy 
*Biomagnetic therapy 
*Regenerative cell therapy 
*Low-dose chemotherapy 
*Hyperthermia 

Costs 

A 3-week treatment plan at the clinic costs $22,000. However, difficult cases may take 6 weeks or longer to treat. In addition, I won't be able to work during that time. Since I'm self-employed, I won't be getting sick pay or vacation pay, and I'll still have all of the usual household expenses to pay. 

What Your Donation Is Doing (8/21/18)

I have already stayed the initial 3 weeks ($22,000), plus an extra week ($7,300). I was unexpectedly hospitalized for a week (versus the usual outpatient care), which was an additional $2,800. After learning that one of the tumors had grown, we decided to fight it with stem cell/bone marrow treatment, which costs $3,500. Now we are seeing signs that my tumor is dying, but it looks like I will need at least one more week of treatment ($7,300).

How You Can Help 

My journey with this disease has just begun, but with the grace of God and your generosity, I'm determined to beat it. Please donate whatever you can. I understand times are tough for a lot of people, but even $5 will help me get the treatment that can save my life. I'm grateful for every penny. Please help me see my daughters reach adulthood. Help me see my 4 children get married. Help me one day see my grandchildren. 

Help me fight. Help me live. Please share my link  with your family and friends:  https://www.gofundme.com/SamFightsCancer Feel free to post it to Facebook or Twitter.

This was written by her husband Brian and he has graciously allowed me to share it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Moana has had normal allergy type symptoms for several years. She lost her hearing several months ago and eventually was not able to breath out of one of her nostrils. We figured that it was some type of a chronic sinus infection. After receiving antibiotics and it didn't improve Moana's provider sent her in to get a CT scan. After the results came back they asked her to do a biopsy. When the results came back we found out that she has NPC. It is a rare form of cancer here in the United States but is more common in other countries and seem to show up a lot in people that are Chinese. The Dr. put a tube in her ear and now she can hear but still can't breath out of her nostril. But she is so positive that she has been celebrating her hearing returning. We found a few places across the US that perform surgery to remove these tumors. We decided that Stanford would be the right fit for Moana. Once we sent in all of the imaging, we found out that she was not a candidate for surgery because the tumor was too big. However, after going through the process we felt like Stanford was still the right place for her to receive chemotherapy and radiation. We will be meeting with the specialists that will be doing her chemotherapy and radiation next week and will have a much more clear understanding of how long the treatments will last. Based on other patients and estimates, it will most likely be roughly six weeks of radiation everyday Mon-Fri but I'm not sure yet how often and when she will receive the chemotherapy treatments. Stanford will be a little far from home and it isn't the most convenient place to get in and out of but after the research that we did we felt like it was the right place. Logistically, we will figure out how it is all going to come together. Moana has been very upbeat and positive and is really an inspiration to me. She has taken the news well but I know that she is a little scared. The love and support that we have received has been life changing. It completely changes the way that I look at the world.

She had to have so many tests that the doctors had to insert a PICC line that goes from the veins in her arm to her heart to make blood draws and medicine easier to administer.After a few more days, the doctors had some answers for us. They diagnosed Indigo with Moyamoya, which is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder. She is at Stage 4, whereas other children diagnosed at her age are generally Stage 1 or 2. Moyamoya causes the  arteries at the base of her brain grow narrower and narrower over time, leading to strokes, muscular weakness, seizures, and, without medical intervention, death. The pediatric neurosurgeons at UCLA recommended bilateral revascularization surgery, which bypasses her blocked arteries,  as the only way to  save Indigo's life.Last week, Indigo underwent the surgery. While the plan was to work on both sides of her brain, the neurosurgeons realized mid-surgery that Indigo's brain was hemorrhaging, and so she was too weak to have the operation on both sides. They spent 6 hours working on the left side of her brain, and they will have to repeat the surgery on the right side of her brain in another 6 months. She woke up from the surgery in extreme pain, and her little face was swollen and bruised.Although the surgery was nerve-wracking for everyone, especially Megan and Rob, we thought that maybe the worst was over. It wasn't. During the night after the surgery, Indigo suffered another stroke. The following night, she started having seizures, one of which lasted more than three hours. That seizure caused Indigo to again lose all her mobility, and also took away her ability to speak.From the time this nightmare began until today, Indigo has had 5 strokes, and 16 seizures.She can't move or talk the way she used to,  and she is scared and bewildered by what is happening to her. She suffers from night terrors, hallucinations from her anti-seizure medications, vomiting, and overwhelming exhaustion. Her little body has been through so much. Megan and Rob cannot bear to leave her side. They are in agony watching their little one suffer as she is. Her life is hanging in the balance.Indigo has been hospitalized in the ICU for nearly a month now.  As a result of this medical catastrophe, their medical bills are piling up. Current estimates put Indigo's medical bills in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. They need as much help as they can get to help Indigo get well enough to go home, and then to return to the ICU for the second half of her surgery. This beautiful, strong, sweet little girl has been through so much, and she is fighting so hard to live and thrive. Please help as much as you can.",497,2.9k,9,496,3 months,24 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,32,Stroke Rehab for Jacquie Marumoto,https://www.gofundme.com/stroke-rehab-for-jacquie-marumoto,"WESTPORT, CT","May 16, 2018","$100,000","$42,433","Dear Friends & Family of Jacquie Marumoto,As most of you know, a little over a year ago in February of 2017 Jacquie suffered a massive, debilitating hemorrhagic stroke. Those early days and weeks were very medically challenging and it was unclear how or IF Jacquie would ultimately recover. After 6 arduous weeks of fighting for her life in the Yale Neurological Intensive Care Unit, Jacquie was transitioned to Gaylord Rehabilitation for 4 months of intensive therapies where she made significant progress towards gaining independence: improvement in swallowing, feeding, speech therapy etc.. Following this challenging therapeutic rehab experience she was discharged to a rehab center in Fairfield. Jacquie returned home eight months ago. While she has continued to progress, recovery is slower and it is unclear how complete the recovery will be. She is still in a wheelchair and fully dependent on her husband, Larry, sister in-law, Jill, family from California, and many other care providers. Life at home has it’s own set of challenges from the vantage point of a wheelchair: narrow interior doorways, lack of a wheelchair accessible ramp for entering & exiting the home, and limited access to the kitchen only to name a few.Before her stroke Jacquie had an 11 year career with Oracle most recently serving as Senior Director in the health sciences group. She took a very active role in raising their daughter, Avery now 10. Accompanying Avery to her activities, birthday events, and school commitments was something Jacquie always took pride in doing. She enjoyed Yoga classes and was an avid golfer. In short, she was like all of us: multidimensional and enjoying a full work, family, and recreational life.Recently Jacquie was admitted into an outpatient program in Norwalk. However, upon starting the out-patient program her home health aide support was cut off. Now, Larry and young Avery must be responsible for attending to all her daily living needs. This understandably has resulted in an inability for Larry to resume full employment, which in turn has amplified the healthcare cost burden on the family. A prideful man, Larry has resisted overtures for financial help for many months. He chose to draw down the family's savings rather than ask for help. Unfortunately, the costs have now become overwhelming. Jacquie’s projected healthcare costs for the next two years are projected to be over $100k - Insurance, deductibles, therapy equipment, home modifications needed for wheelchair accessibility ….. the list of financial demands is nearly endless !We are fortunate to live in an affluent community, and most of us are lucky enough to have successful careers. Until two years ago, Jacquie and Larry were as fortunate as we are. It is sobering and sad to realize how quickly this can be lost, and how precarious our seemingly stable lives can actually be.While Jacquie has made significant progress and now is, in very general terms, able to:-- speak -- though volume, word recall, and breath control are still issues-- walk using a walker with assistance-- sit upright and maintain balance with some prompting-- transfer from a wheelchair to bed and more with assistance-- accomplish most ADLs (activities of daily living) at a wheelchair level with minimal assistancePlease join us in our goal to ease their burden. We are starting this “Go Fund Me” page in an effort to raise  $100K to help support our friends in need. With our help, Jacquie can continue to progress with her rehab and her home can be made more comfortable and accessible. Our small contributions will go a long way, and Jacquie (and Larry) will be eternally grateful for your generosity of spirit.With love & gratitude, Team JacquieCindy Reejhsinghani, Jill Perlstein, & Sabrina Maurer",199,444,15,206,3 months,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Due to recommendations from her doctor at the center, she is going to be receiving a low dose chemo treatment twice a week. This is not a traditional form of chemo and it is administered with insulin. The side-affects are minimal and the results have been very promising with other recipients. However, it is very expensive, well over the cost of the initial treatment plan. Each treatment is $5000 and her treatment calls for 2 infusions per week. In addition to the new cost of treatment, we're looking at an extended stay in California.  We have exhausted every financial avenue available to us and  without your generosity our funds will run out before the end of this week. That is how urgent this request is. We appreciate everything that you have all already given and we humbly ask you to continue to give what you can. Please share with everyone that you can and ask them to share it as well. Hi, We’re Tim and Kaitlyn Yant.. Thanks for taking a few minutes to read our story. We first met when we were just kids in our church youth group but started dating when we ended up going to the same college years later. We got married in November of 2009. We finished school, got real adult jobs, and bought our first house. Everything a young couple usually does. Five years after getting married we decided to start trying to have babies. After years of trying doctors diagnosed Kaitlyn with uterine fibroids but said there didn’t seem to be any other complications other than the fibroids. But, there definitely was... On May 12, 2017 we went out to dinner with Kaitlyn’s family - a normal family dinner on a Friday night. After getting home that evening Kaitlyn began experiencing a lot of stomach pain. After being in pain all night we decided to head to the emergency room on Saturday May 13th. Expecting it to be a common gall bladder issue or something like that, we couldn’t have ever prepared ourselves for the news we were going to get... A CT scan revealed a very large malignant mass in Kaitlyn’s uterus. Kaitlyn was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, low grade serous carcinoma. A punch to the gut. Our world stopped spinning as every plan for our future came crashing down around us. We broke the life altering news to our families that Mother’s Day weekend 2017. Then began the whirlwind of doctors appointments and treatments. Kaitlyn endured surgery after surgery and unsuccessful treatments. We were told that she would have a maximum of 1 year to live. Kaitlyn’s oncologist said that the cancer she has does not usually respond to chemo so if we wanted to pursue having traditional chemo treatments there is a very high chance that it would not work or if it did work, then the chance of the cancer coming back a few years later and being more aggressive is extremely high. BUT, the fight is NOT over yet. Kaitlyn has beat the odds and is now living day by day past the one year original prognosis. Because of the grim outcome of traditional treatments we have chosen for Kaitlyn to seek non-traditional treatments at Cancer Center for Healing in Irvine, CA where they have seen success in stopping and reversing cancer! Cancer has stolen a lot from us - Our ability to have children, our money, and our time. But it can’t take the things that truly matter - our joy, our faith, and our hope. Please warrior on with us in prayer as we cry out for Kaitlyn’s complete healing. Also, please consider donating to help pay for the numerous medical bills, medical supplies, and further treatments that Kaitlyn needs.",301,1.9k,11,346,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

I feel like I could write an entire book. This has been a long difficult road filled with many sad tears, happy tears, big decisions, and everything in between. I’ll stick with a short version for now and write the entire story at another time. During our 20 week ultrasound, which led to several others and a MRI quickly following, the doctors discovered that our baby was missing most of his/her brain. And instead of a brain, it was replaced with cerebral spinal fluid. The fluid was going to continue to expand the head of our baby. The head size was measuring about 3 weeks ahead of normal. We were told our baby wouldn’t live past several days, if not hours, or die before birth. The diagnosis given was semilobar holoprosencephaly, and the prognosis for these cases are very bleak. Essentially since half way through our pregnancy, we have been preparing to bury our precious little one, and spend as much time as possible with him or her as we could. While still pregnant, we tried to do as many memory-making things along the way like: baby’s first motorcycle ride, baby’s first vacation, and other fun things to fill our hearts with happiness instead of focusing purely on the sadness that would inevitably come. Speeding this story up to week 37 with our last ultrasound on Friday, July 27 our perinatologist looked at the ultrasound and said that if we wanted any chance of a normal birth without c-section, we needed to get induced immediately. Baby’s head size has grown to 4-5 weeks ahead of schedule. We were admitted to Mercy without issue within a couple hours and began the birth and induction process. After 2 full days of induction with nothing like our birth plan (more of that story to come later), we gave birth to Matthew James Corpstein at 11:21am, 7 pounds 14 oz, 21 inches. He was breathing and regulated his heartbeat on his own. We were told that these were things he would do, but the doctors weren’t sure he would be able to feed. We were told he likely wouldn’t see, hear, or feel pain. After he was born, he was able to latch and nurse right away. He responded to lights, voices, and touch. These were things that he supposedly wouldn’t do. We decided to do a follow up MRI to determine if the original diagnosis was right. The results came back, and then suddenly we were talking with a pediatric neurosurgeon who said that he definitely DOES NOT have semilobar holoprosencephaly. That there is much more brain tissue than originally thought, and instead he has hydrocephalus. This new diagnosis still means Matthew has extra fluid in his brain, but the difference is that the fluid is pushing the brain tissue to the side of the head, making it appear as if there’s no tissue, when in fact there is. The new MRI showed that they could see all or almost all of the front and right brain tissues, and most of the back side. The left side was difficult to tell because that area had the most fluid that was pushing into all the other sides of his brain. The neurosurgeon told us it’s possible he could lead a completely normal life. Many hydrocephalus babies live with no abnormalities. Many also have some developmental delays or disabilities. We simply couldn’t believe what we were hearing! We had prepared for the last 4 to 5 months of not bringing a baby home, of using hospice and end of life care, and now suddenly Matthew’s chances of survival are high and having a fully functioning life could be possible! It’s like buying a lottery ticket and actually winning the jackpot! We were overjoyed, and I just still can’t put into words how we feel about the amazing news. We know God was protecting us and our beautiful baby boy, and we had put our faith in His hands, come whatever may. So where are we now with all of this?Matthew needed to do emergency brain surgery to drain the fluid from his brain, which would allow his brain tissues to expand back. The surgery happened when he was just two days old, on Tuesday, July 31. This required putting a shunt in his brain, that would drain down into his abdomen. He will have this for the rest of his life, and likely will have other surgeries, tests, and MRIs down the road to make sure it is functioning properly as he grows. Surgery went well, and he is recovering like a champ. The neurology nurses told us this was a very severe case of hydrocephalus, but he is doing remarkably well. A good friend called him Matthew The Great for being such a miracle, and that’s exactly what he is. He is our little miracle. A boy who wasn’t supposed to be born alive, much less do anything else, has showed us that God is protecting us and blessing us beyond anything we can imagine. Matthew means ""Gift from God""!We ask for prayers and well wishes during Matthew’s initial healing and what the future holds. Thank you from the bottoms of our hearts for those of you who are praying, sending messages, and donating money.",796,1.2k,29,741,1 month,2 days ago,1 day,2018-09-03

Through a meeting with his daughter Kassy and friends, they convinced him that his health was a major concern and the drug usage was possibly causing behavioral and physical problems. While hospitalized, they found that his heart was severely thickened, causing heart failure which he will have to be monitored closely and take medication for the rest of his life. Neurologically he has suffered multiple strokes that have affected his entire brain. There are certain parts that will no longer function properly, causing severe behavioral changes and some physical ones. The damage is permanent and irreversible. He will be going to physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and speech therapy to rewire the brain. He will also be going to a rehab center for drug usage when medically better. Currently this is what we know, and these are the conditions he has been diagnosed with: Leukoencephalopathy Intracranial atherosclerosisHypertrophic cardiomyopathyScott is in the care of his Daughter Kassy, his Mother, his sister Coleen, and his brothers.

He is an incredible band director, a friend to all, a mentor to countless students, a devoted family man and a loyal follower of Christ. In January of 2018, John was told due to a  heredity condition, he would need heart surgery. It didn’t seem fair to any of us because John is an incredibly healthy person. However, he chose to follow his doctor’s advice and have the surgery. Within three days of his surgery, and while still in recovery at the hospital, we were told that John had three massive strokes. He was airlifted to another hospital in Charlotte and after a procedure to stop the strokes, was put in the neurological ICU. When he first started to wake up, John was paralyzed on the entire right side of his body. He couldn’t speak, eat, stand, sit up, or even keep his eyes open for longer than a few seconds. Since then, almost 4 months has passed. John has made incredible progress that seemed impossible by many doctors. He has full physical function of his body. He is actually very physically fit considering what he has gone through. Cognitively though, he still has a long road ahead of him. We have discovered through an incredible amount of research, that there is a facility that can help John with his specific needs in Atlanta. His doctors do not think there is any other facility that can help him in the way that he desperately needs. Insurance will not help John pay for the rehabilitation in Atlanta. As a family, we have decided we have to help him get there regardless. We are now at a point that we have exhausted all financial means possible. We are so greatful for the hundreds of people who have already helped John with donations, food, cards, gifts, and keeping his house maintained. We are asking now that anyone out there who knows John personally or through the grapevine, to please donate what you can to his cause.  The rate for care at the facility in Atlanta is over $1000 per day. With an average length of stay of 90 - 120 days we would ultimately need to sell John's home to cover the expense. We are desperately trying to keep his life waiting for him exactly as he left it but we also know we have to get him back first. Any and all help you can give is greatly appreciated by all of us. If you can’t give financially, please add John in your thoughts and prayers. His army of prayer warriors has gotten him through countless hurdles already. Now he just needs to get through a few more.

Occasionally I am asked- ‘what do you like to do when you’re not traveling for work’?  My reply?  “Travel for fun”!But in May 2014, I was diagnosed w “Mumford and Sons”. Ok its MS, or “Multiple Sclerosis”, but I just try to make a very uncool disease sound a little bit cooler to take my mind off the tragic, senseless loss of functions, and mobility, notwithstanding the constant pain and fatigue. Many advances have been made in the medical field for MS that slow the progression of the disease, but there is no cure and there is no stopping the inevitable outcome of permanent disability. In the course of 4 years, I have been on two different treatments, the latest and strongest available- Tecfidera and then Ocrevus, which have been very costly. This has been a great hardship on us, to say the least. The real challenge has been however, that my condition has continued to deteriorate with walking and doing most physical activities extremely hard. Even more challenging is the stress brought from fatigue/exhaustion, extreme sensitivities to heat and the “cog-fog”, or simply the ability to think and to concentrate.MS is a cruel disease, taking most of the things I enjoy in my life away from me and my family. Yes, they have suffered along with me and made countless sacrifices for me along this journey.But there is one and only One treatment to permanently STOP MS, and it is HSCT. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.HSCT                                        Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, blood cell-producing stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body. The person remains in the hospital for an additional period of time while the immune system begins to rebuild itself. The immune system gradually rebuilds itself anywhere from 3 months to a year.NEXT STEPSI have been accepted to Pirigov Hospital in Moscow with Dr. Denis Fedoreno, a world-renowned Miracle Man in this field.I begin treatment on October 22, 2018, so some very short 5 months away! This is terribly exciting and at the same time terribly stressful.  Stressful in the sense of how much preparation is involved, providing care for Lynn as she accompanies me, taking care of my business activities for a period of time, and most of all, for the cost of the treatment. It is $50,000 USD for treatment, including the hospital stay in Russia, and then another estimated $10k for travel and logistics (including lodging for Lynn). Treatment will take approximately 30+ days, so we will be away for some time. And unfortunately, insurance does not cover any of the cost. My goal is to raise $40,000.Despite the difficulties, I have maintained a full-time work schedule, including travel of 100k to 150k miles of flying every year, convention schedules, customer meetings, board meetings, and various other work activities. I have done everything in my power to hold on to a career and job that I love and support my family while doing so. I like to say- “I don’t quit when I’m tired, I quit when I’m finished!” But this dedication has come with a price. A steep price, both physically and mentally.But with a glad heart, I have been Blessed with receiving a “Golden Ticket” (Willy Wonka reference, but you got that, right??) It is worth more than all the Gold in the world, but it also comes with the price of Gold! So far, I have never asked for any help along my journey, but honestly, I am at the point where I must humbly call upon friends and colleagues to consider “investing” in me to help me get my life back! This is a matter of My Life, or a Life left of diminished probabilities and possibilities.I miss taking walks, I miss being able to go out for dinners, to see friends, to make plans and NOT having to cancel, to travel to see the balance of our bucket list, and mostly to be able to practice my violin without excruciating pain in my hands and arms. The list of “I miss” is long, but the chance of doing these things again is Great. Great is His Faithfulness……I do not do this or ask this lightly, it has come from prayerful consideration and a great deal of humility. The fact is, there is a solution, I can see it, I can almost touch it, but I need your help.If would consider playing a part in ‘Reclaiming My Life- 2018”, I would deeply appreciate your help.

Medical,33,Help with Sophie’s hospital bills,https://www.gofundme.com/help-with-sophies-hospital-bills,"CAVE CREEK, AZ","March 29, 2018","$50,000","$40,737","Hello All, Many of you may know Sophie- my beautiful, intelligent and happy four year old niece. Recently she went for her routine four year check up and had very high blood pressure (about 160/100). The doctor told her mom (Ana) to come back and they would check it again. Her blood pressure was high again when they went back. After cat scans and MRI’s they saw a narrowing in her aorta in a few places, a smaller kidney and a enlarged heart. All of this made no sense to any of us, she was always so happy and full of life. Sophie didn’t seem sick at all. Ana and Scott flew Sophie to Cinnicinati children’s hospital to get a procedure done to help with the narrowing. There they discovered that her insides were inflamed so they could not continue with the procedure. At this point we heard the first possible diagnosis of takayasu- an extremely rare auto immune disorder. Sophie was emmited to Phoenix Children’s for 16 days while they tried to treat her inflammation and high blood pressure. She left the hospital recently on seven different types of blood pressure medications, steroids and chemo with the hope that we would continue her treatment at home and get another MRI in 3 months to see the progression. Unfortunatly, that was not the way it worked out. Sophie started crying in pain because her foot was hurting. Ana noticed that it was colder than the other foot and discolored. Worried she rushed her to the hospital. They did more testing on her and found out that she had a massive old and hardened blood clot near her hip and another blood clot in her toe. After two failed procedures to get the blood clot to move, Sophie’s lungs colapased yesterday and she is currently on breathing tubes. Ana and Scott plan to fly her to Boston children’s hospital in a medical emergency plane where they have doctors who have treated this horrible disease takayasu and can help her with her blood clotting. This is the most traumatic event my family has ever been through. Sophie is our little angel and was a happy four year old girl with so much life in her. This experience has drained her and her beautiful parents who are doing everything they can to save their little girls life. The last thing I would want is for them to worry about money and hospital bills. I know that currently they are in a lot of debt with everything that has happened. The debt is the last thing on their mind, but if we can help make their lives easier while they continue this hard and long battle then it would mean the world to them and to me. I appreciate you taking the time to read about Sophie’s story. If you are unable to help financially, just sharing this message and getting the word out there is more than enough. I will also be posting updates of how Sophie is doing periodically. Thank you for your support! We are #sophiestrong! ***Please note: at the moment Ana and Scott are not in a place to discuss Sophie’s state. They are focused on getting her the best care and being a strong support for Sophie in the hospital. Please respect their privacy right now as this is all very new. If you have questions, you can direct them to me. Warmly, Kelsey",399,1.4k,9,391,5 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

Her life was turned upside down one year ago when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.Treatment So Far:  Kat had surgery in March 2017 to remove tumors from her colon and appendix. Since then she has undergone 18 rounds of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the chemo is not working and the tumors continue to spread and grow, threatening vital body functions.Life-Saving Surgery:The latest colonoscopy revealed that Kat has another extremely large tumor that is fast growing and aggressive. Kat will be flying from Santa Rosa, California to Washington DC for a life-saving cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) in March 2018. This surgery will remove the tumor, part of her bowel, spleen, uterus, part of the abdomen and all discovered areas where cancerous cells are found. Immediately after, she will get a high dose, high temperature chemotherapy bath applied directly into the abdomen to attack microscopic cancer cells. Kat will be in the ICU for two days minimum following surgery and in the hospital for at least 14 days. She will probably not be able to walk when released from the hospital.Hope & Your Help:Kat is extremely fortunate that the surgeon who invented this procedure, Dr. Paul Sugarbaker, will be performing the surgery. While Kaiser has agreed to pay for most of the medical expenses, your donations will help towards expenses in Washington DC and with the long recovery back home. Kat has not worked in her full-time job at Santa Rosa Junior College since she was admitted to the hospital one year ago. Thanks:Kat believes this surgery will save her life and give her many additional years with her family. She and her family would like to thank you in advance from the bottom of their hearts for your generosity!

She spent her entire adult life caring for other people’s kiddos, feeding the elderly, and volunteering to cook for kids in the community.  She and her husband, VG, have hosted Danish exchange students and have a rescue Beagle. They open their home to family and friends in need, always offer healthy food, and a sense of community. Monica cares deeply about supporting local businesses and eating the healthiest food available (her instagram is @allmymoneyisforfood). She spreads her love throughout the community with food deliveries, babysitting, and care-taking for local families (many of whom have also been touched by cancer).How Monica Learned She Had Adrenocortical Carcinoma - 1 in a Million chances.Monica finally met the love of her life in 2010. She and her husband were eager to have children but unfortunately this was not possible. This was devastating for such a loving couple who care so much about children. Then in 2015 and 2 miscarriages later, they were both hit by more stunning news. Monica had to have her right adrenal gland and tumor removed. The results came through a week later, it was Adrenocortical Carcinoma “ACC” a one in a million cancer with a very high recurrence rate.  Monica didn’t have to do treatment, as the only chemo used for adrenocortical carcinoma “ACC” is mitotane (a derivative of DDT) and the jury is still out (ongoing clinical trials) as to if it actually prevents recurrence. The only known cure for adrenal cancer is surgical removal. Alternative Diet to Prevent RecurrenceMonica had radically changed her diet to be “plant based” to hopefully prevent recurrence.  For such a rare and “orphan” cancer, where less than 600 cases are diagnosed a year, it’s largely up to the individual to decide which course of treatment is best, to be your own advocate and push for scans to find recurrence ASAP. However the Follow-up Scan found Lesions on the LiverMonica pushed for a scan in the spring of 2017, after coughing for a month or more and worrying that she had a lung recurrence. Fortunately, there was no recurrence in 2017. However, when the next scan came in May of 2018, they did detect liver lesions. The cancer recurrence was also wrapped around her IVC, making surgery more risky.  The head surgeon of Santa Barbara’s Ridley-Tree cancer center said that surgical resection was possible but after further imaging, decided it was impossible at the cottage hospital and too risky. Please Help Monica fight This Inoperable Metastasis Which Chemo Can’t KillBecause of this inoperable metastasis which chemo can’t kill, Monica wants to try holistic therapy in Arizona (as seen in “Cancer Can Be Killed"" documentary on Amazon). Because this approach is non-traditional medicine and is not covered under traditional insurance, the financial burden will be significant. Because this cancer is aggressive, she needs to begin this alternative approach now. Help extend Monica's life. She still has more to give and share with the community. We will continue to update you on Monica's journey in her fight against this cancer. Thanks for sharing this and for your consideration.",218,524,24,237,2 months,23 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

But it is especially difficult to comprehend when it attacks someone has spent their entire life supporting others. If you know Kevin then you know that he is a man of incredible character. He is generous of spirit, time, and resources. And he is one of the warmest and most hilarious people you will ever meet.Kevin has committed himself - and his life -  to a practice of radical empathy for others. He also has committed his life to community advocacy. He did this initially during the AIDS crisis with ACT UP from the 1980’s-1990’s. Throughout his life he has supported and mentored many friends and helped them get back on their feet. Kevin’s advocacy work continues to mature and has become more refined over the years; in 2016, days after the Pulse massacre, Kevin co-founded Gays Against Guns (GAG) a volunteer group fighting to save lives through better gun laws. His contribution to this inclusive, grassroots activist group has been integral to its success and has earned him the moniker of “Mother GAG”.  Mother has fought for us, and now we are fighting for her.  Kevin is facing immediate surgery which will be followed by extensive cancer treatments. Kevin has been self-employed as a prop and set stylist for over 20 years. As a result of working under independent contracts, he has zero access to any short or long-term disability through an employer. This means that Kevin will have no income for the entire duration of his treatment and recovery. At least six months, if not more.  And no income means no money to pay for his insurance, his rent, and all basic living expenses. As a self-employed person, he carries the full cost of his health insurance on his own. Even with this insurance, he will be faced with with the significant additional costs of expensive treatments very much needed  to defeat the cancer.  The Hertzog family and the GAG family are asking the community to come together to support Kevin through this difficult time.

The E.R. doctors at the time proceeded with a sinus drainage, the experience was painful and pointless, since it was repeated 6 times to no avail.  The infection traveled to the lungs, and quickly went from bronchitis to pneumonia. I was back at the E.R. this time, a month had elapsed and I had dropped from 180lbs to 160lbs. I stayed 2 weeks in the infectious wing of the hospital in Sweden before deciding to fly out to Paris France to see if they could find out what I had.Four days, during 4 days I went through all possible tests and biopsies. Having traveled extensively prior to getting ill, all viruses and diseases were possible. Spinal tap, kidney and lung biopsies. I was so week by then that I couldn't get out of bed, my joints inflamed and locked weighing 146 lbs. In the afternoon of the fourth day the team of doctor and the professor of the Pulmonary department announced they were pretty sure they had pinpointed the culprit, however, my condition had deteriorated so much that there would not be a second try if they were wrong. The doctors were right. It was WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS.

This was so sudden it was surreal. I had not seen any signs or better said I couldn't see them because 2017 had been one long and arduous road. The new house I had bought, the family I had, my financial situation, all I had worked so hard to achieve all fell apart. My kidneys are now oscillating between CDK 5 and CDK 4. CDK 5 stands for Chronic Kidney Disease level 5 which is kidney failure, and the need for dialysis before Renal Transplant. CDK 4 means that damage to the kidneys is now irreversible and preparations for dialysis and a kidney transplant are necessary.A donor would, short of saving my life, give me a new life, one where I can taste, feel, live fully, without my body limiting and dictating what I can or cannot do or how active I can be. I work as a tennis pro and for the past 3 months I have been working at 50% of my capacity, eating away at my savings and at my weight, I have lost 12 lbs in the last 2 months. This past week I have been meeting with the transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic in Florida. I am now on a diet to help gain some weight back. I have started weight training again all to be in the best shape for the surgery.￼￼A kidney transplant involves a heavy financial cost, costly drugs and nearly 10 to 12 weeks before I can run and swing a racket after the operation. Every donation of any amount will help tremendously.My family is far away from me, the only family I have in Florida is my 2 year old daughter, who gives me strength and courage when the going gets tough. If you are not able to make a donation, please send your good thoughts and relay my story around you. It is difficult for me to write about this publicly and ask for help, I have tried for so long to keep this quiet and only those close to me really understand how serious things had gotten. ￼",145,376,2,145,3 months,13 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

Terry, the dad, and Cheryl, the mom, have raised four wonderful kids. Sadly, their 3rd child, Nate Niekamp, a freshman at St. Henry High School, was diagnosed with Sarcoma last week. Nate loves sports; if he is not tossing a football, he is shooting a basketball. After struggling with a hamstring issue for several months, he discovered a lump shortly after basketball season ended. It was not his hamstring that was bothering him; it was a tumor leading to the pain he was feeling in his leg.

Everyone that meets Ever loves her radiant smile, winning personality and non-convincing shyness. She's warm, funny, energetic and she's just beginning to explore her skills as a painter, and her role as a big sister.  On March 17th, 2018 Ever's life was changed forever, and our family's life was turned upside down as she was diagnosed with Leukemia (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-ALL). Needless to say we were utterly devistated upon hearing this diagnosis, but there was a bit of good news in the prognosis--ALL is curable. We now consider ourselves extremely fortunate, blessed, and luckly. We have something to hold onto. We have a hope. We have a (very) good chance to save our baby's life. That right, Ever can be cured and go on the live a close to normal life, but the ride will be long and extremely hard. Indeed, the road ahead is very difficult for Ever (and her family). She will face challenges that 3 year old children should never have face, including an infusion of chemotherapy for the next 26 months, high-frequency visits to the hospital, no exposure to large gatherings of people (public transportation, airplanes, movies, etc), a plethora of chemical cocktails and pills that would scare any sane person, a restricted diet, limited and/or no schooling, and most importantly limited access to friends, family and loved ones (to ensure she is not exposed to infectious diseases, viruses, and bacteria). Still, given the encouraging odds of her survival, we are holding our breaths, crossing our fingers and saying our prayers. That said, there is still a lot we just don't know? There are a lot of expenses that our family will incur that we will likely be unable to cover. We are investing a serious amount of time into understanding this disease, its associated costs, and the best tools for fighting it. Moreover, we are looking at ways to ensure Ever can remain a positive, creative and engaged as a toddler.  Honestly, we (Ever, Mom, Dad, and Shiloh) know its a lot, but we will get it done with the support of our friends, family and loved ones.  We want to thank you in advance for any generosity you can spare for this cause. We have outlined how funds will be used below and we will be upding this page and our facebook page over the next 2 years to keep everyone updated on Ever's progress.Again, we sincerely thank you for your time and generosity. 

What we know1. March 17th diagnosed with cancer (Leukemia)2. There is a cure, but it is a lengthy and expensive process 3. Chemotherapy is at the center of this cure4. This treament will be extremely taxing on Ever's body and immune systemWhat we don't know1. If this Cure will definitely work for Ever (we believe it will, but it is not definite)2. What are all of the medical expenses for treating Leukemia 3. What we don't know (what are the other expenses, challenges, hurdles we will have to face as part of this journey)Why we need your help1.

Medical,34,Help Heal Matt Hallock and Family,https://www.gofundme.com/heal-matt-hallock-and-family,"WATSONVILLE, CA","June 16, 2018","$90,000","$40,301","Hello dear friends, family, and future friends. Thank you to all of you who have encouraged us, pushed us higher, and called out the good that God has put in us...even during times when sickness made it hard to see that any good was there.It has been a few years now since we were publicly sharing details of my health with our friends, family and network. And here's why: We don't want sickness and doctors and treatments to define our lives. God has put a lot more inside us than just that. And to be honest, most of the time we'd rather talk about other dreams and projects, things we know God put us here to do. Thinks like:   --Corrie's book    --Rebecca's dance   --Our Steadfast Marriage ministry     --My newly started Masculine Christian writing endeavors   --My new High School English teaching adventureThese are the things that drive us. They are what God has put us here to do. But friends, it's time for me to talk about my health again. This disease is serious right now, and truthfully, we could use your support.For those of you who don't know our story, it's pretty long. So in case you don't have the time to read the whole thing, here are the bullet points for you.----------------------BULLET POINTS----------------------   1) I have battled a severe, aggressive case of autoimmune arthritis all over my body for 11 years. Was bed-ridden at one point...unable to function let alone work.   2) After 9 years of searching for curative treatments, we've spent the last two years at Stanford receiving heavy duty, dangerous drugs that had been doing a great job at alleviating the symptoms...but not CURING my body.   3) Those treatments...the MOST POWERFUL ones known to our conventional medicine system are not working anymore. And my pain, inflammation, immobility, weight-loss are rushing back aggressively.   4) Leading up to May, I was teaching full time as a High School English teacher (loving it and loving being ABLE to work). This helped us be able to rent our OWN HOME for the first time in 8 years. My girls have their own yard for the first time ever.   5) But my body is getting worse quickly and Stanford is about out of ideas. I can barely get up in the morning. Can't put on socks. Can't brush my teeth. Lots of pain. If school were back in session, I wouldn't be able to work. School starts in August, and I don't know if I will be able to return to teaching at that time.   6) I am also currently stuck on a drug called Prednisone, which is a steroid with serious side effects. It is eating away my bones, skin, and other connective tissues, but it keeps my pain down.   7) This is urgent. My body is getting worse quickly and we want to do SOMEthing to help me be able to work in August.   8) HOW YOU CAN HELP           --Donate to our fund any amount you feel able to           --Sharing this GoFundMe campaign with anyone you can think of who might have the heart and resources to                invest in our family.----------------------THE FULL STORY----------------------STANFORD TREATMENTSAlmost two years ago exactly, Corrie and I decided on a huge shift. For the 9 years prior, we had gone down every route we could find looking for a way to actually cure my body. We changed our nutrition (which we are thankful for and still embrace whole-heartedly). We traveled to a doctor in Nevada...twice.We attacked Lyme Disease, mycoplasma infection, used anything we could find to make headway.But my body still got worse. And it got to the point where I was taking 40mg per day of Prednisone in order to manage my pain and inflammation.At that point, two years ago, my current doctor said I needed to go see a standard rheumatologist and get the standard rheumatology drugs. That may be the only thing that would bring relief.So I went to Stanford, met an amazing doctor, and together we decided on my starting Remicade infusions. This is the. most. powerful. treatment option in the tool belt of standard conventional rheumatology.And for eight months, it worked beautifully. I was able to decrease my Prednisone down to 2mg per day. But then suddenly my body started resisting the Remicade, and my pain and inflammation came back.So we tried many of the other drugs in their tool belt...none of which did anything. And after 2ish months, we went back to Remicade which again helped for another 8 months or so...until this last May.BUILDING A NEW LIFE FOR OUR FAMILYBut before May hit, while that treatment was working, Corrie and I and our two girls (and dog) finally started to feel like we were getting to live a normal life.Last January, I applied for and immediately received a teaching position at my old High School teaching freshmen English. This was the first real job I had been able to work in about 6 years. And I was nervous about whether I'd be able to physically handle the schedule, but we went for it.I loved it. As near as I can tell, my students loved me too. They asked if I could teach sophomore English next year. They'd say I was their favorite teacher.I shared Jesus with them daily. I prayed for them. I saw Jesus heal them. And I've been planning with the administration a chapel venue that I could lead next year aimed at discipling the young men to be strong, confident, God-on-fire men ready to bring value to their world.Also, right after my starting teaching, we were able to move out of living with family and finally rent our first own home in 8 years. This is where we are now, and we love it. It's been a dream of ours that has felt so out of reach during the times when I could hardly get out of bed.Here's the girls playing in their first ever backyard :)The feeling of finally giving my family a home is amazing. I've been working hard both teaching and running my already existing side-business coaching students on the SAT in order to get our feet under us after these many years of dealing financially with this disease.THE CURRENT STATE OF MATT'S HEALTHBut then, this past May, the treatments I'm getting at Stanford, the most powerful option they know of, started not working again. And this time, my pain and inflammation started raging back faster and harder than before.It's difficult to share with you the severity of the condition, because it doesn't carry the same tragic connotation that other diseases do. You hear arthritis and you think, ""Well, that sucks, but at least it's not cancer or something.""I currently am waking up every morning in intense pain all through my body. So much so that I can't put on socks or brush my teeth. That pain and stiffness start to subside a little bit around 3pm and then ramp back up around 8pm. My feet joints are crooked and my toes are bending over on themselves. My knees don't straighten all the way.Years ago, my right elbow had such severe arthritis that it locked in about a 90 degree angle, and is still locked today.  Also I dropped down to about 115 pounds and looked awful. Corrie thought I was going to die.That's me, weighing something-a-grown-six-foot-man-shouldn't-weigh :)Now, my left elbow and wrist are starting to go the same direction.The pain and immobility are bad enough to lead me to cancel my speaking commitment at our church tomorrow, Father's Day 2018.At the moment, if school were in session, I wouldn't be able to work. School starts early August, there's a real possibility that I won't be able to go back.All of this from something that has been called Undifferentiated Spondyloarthropothy, Lyme Disease, or (most recentlly by Stanford) Psoriatic Arthritis.MATT'S CURRENT TREATMENT SITUATIONSo, after spending 9 years pursuing alternative treatments that were somewhat financially manageable, we finally went to one of the top facilities in western medicine and now their best option for me is not working. We are trying some other less powerful options but still seeing no effect.Since that's the case, my only option at the moment is to increase my Prednisone dose to very high levels, so that I can function. The problem with that is that Prednisone causes thin, tearable skin, brittle bones, and a host of other major side effects. I have broken my back and ribs and arm because of this.Also, it gives me quite a puffy face when the dose is high!But I choose either that or the daily pain and inflammation.HOW YOU CAN HELP FINANCIALLYI tell you all of this so that you can know two things:a) We want to take ownership of our lives and take care of ourselves so that we can give to others. I work hard and want to work harder and plan to.b) Even though I work hard and want to take care of my own crap, right now this disease is a big giant to slay. And I need help.We have set our goal at $90,000...here's the breakdown:Rent and Expenses through 2018 = $35,000We JUST got blessed with moving into our own home after all this time. I'm looking at maybe not being able to work and receive my salary when August hits. I want with all my heart to keep my family in our home and to give me more time to get my body well so I can get back to work and pay our own way.This portion would allow for that very thing.I will also be investing time, energy, and resources in my existing SAT business so that, if December hits and my body still needs more time, our business will be able to sustain us better than it does right now.Treatment at the Paracelsus Clinic in Switzerland = $55,000My body needs intensive, effective treatment. The best our system has to offer isn't working. Before, we tried visiting different doctor's offices in our area but nothing so advanced, all-encompassing, and powerful as this clinic in Europe.This is an estimate of the cost of the three week, daily treatment program that I would do there, including lodging and travel. I know that looks insanely expensive, but to put it in perspective...One of my Remicade infusions costs $50,000. And I get those every six weeks. And they're not even working anymore! (Thank goodness for Medicare)It's time I get freaking serious about healing because I'm done living on borrowed time that these super powerful drugs have given me. Clearly, under the surface of alleviated symptoms, my body is still massively struggling to be healthy.I don't have time to toy around with anything less than the most powerful options out there.My family needs their husband/dad/man to be strong and able to provide. Able to lead. That's why I'm not wasting time with little office visits here and there. This is serious.URGENCYWhile there is no hard deadline on this...we have to move quickly for a couple reasons.1) I want to teach again come August. I love it and the kids need me.2) My body, when it starts to flare up, gets worse very quickly.  One week I can be playing outside with the girls, and the next I can be barely able to step out the door.3) Planning for our finances, if I don't return to work in August, we will need to pay rent and other expenses while I get my body back online.For all those factors, I want to move fast and begin action on this even within the next month.FINAL THOUGHTSWe know with all our hearts that God is our provider. We have seen him do miracles in our finances without us ever asking anyone. But right now, we are asking you, the people that he has used to bless our lives so much already, if you can help us during this fourth-quarter-half-court-shot time.If you are able to donate, you would bless our whole family. Even if you can't donate, could you please share this with your network? Social media, personal emails, calls, whatever you think of. I'm calling all hands on deck for this one, so however you are able to spread the word, we would be very thankful.Bless you all. I pray that Jesus fills you all with his goodness and hope and that he answers any places of pain in your own life and brings you victory...even that victory that you've been waiting a long time for.You were meant to conquer. Never settle for anything less. We love you.",240,636,18,250,2 months,8 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

A freshman at Central Michigan University, he began having pain in his hip that continued off and on throughout his first semester. The pain intensified around Christmas of 2017 at which point he was referred to an orthopedic doctor who suspected it was an injury from his last baseball season. ￼￼￼An MRI done in January of 2018 showed a mass on his hip at which point he was referred to an Orthopedic Oncologist that diagnosed him with Fibrous Dysplasia. With the Dysplasia diagnosis, it was recommended that he begin physical therapy. Noah went to therapy three days a week for six weeks with no resolve to his pain, in fact it had exacerbated. Undergoing another MRI, doctors discovered that the mass on his hip had enlarged to the point that it fractured his femur. Surgery was then scheduled for June 20th to clean out his joint as well as biopsy the inflamed area. ￼￼￼On June 28th his biopsy results confirmed that the mass on his pelvis was actually a Tumor, more specifically a bone Tumor named Ewing’s Sarcoma.Ewing’s Sarcoma for those who do not know, is a very rare type of cancerous tumor that grows in ones bones or the soft tissue around ones bones. Ewing’s sarcoma affects about 200 children and young adults every year in the United States. Within a week of this diagnosis, Noah underwent a PET scan, 2-D scan, multiple x-rays, an MRI, blood work and a bone marrow test. By the grace of God, his sarcoma did not metastasize and is currently contained within his pelvis. It has grown to the size of a tennis ball, pushing on his bladder. ￼￼￼Those of you who know Noah are well aware of the incredible young man he is. We have not once heard Noah complain about this diagnosis. He is an inspiration to all of us with his continued positive outlook on life. He has always been an exemplary student, graduating high school with a 4.0 GPA while maintaining his commitments to baseball and family. He has just begun his next journey pursuing a career in business at Central Michigan (again still maintaining his 4.0 GPA his freshman year). The evening of his biopsy surgery he made sure to complete an assignment that was due for an online summer course he was taking! The kid does not stop! This is why we know he will beat this with a vengeance!￼￼￼￼￼￼Noah’s treatment will require chemotherapy and radiation, along with extended hospital stays due to the intensity of his treatments over the course of the next year. He will require multiple scans, x-rays and MRI’s during and following treatment.It goes without saying that all of your continued prayers, love and support mean so much to the Holloway’s! If you are also able to offer any financial support your contribution will help to pay for Noah’s treatment for this disease which includes insurance deductibles, co-pays and any out of pocket expenses for treatments, medication and supplements not covered by insurance. Even the smallest donations will help. ￼￼￼As Noah begins his treatments, please continue to keep him in your thoughts and prayers. We know that with the support of those around him; his strength, determination and faith will guide him through this next year and kick this disease! Thank you, we are beyond grateful for all of your support!￼￼￼*This GoFundMe is organized and run by Noah Holloway's family members; Jonathan Ren, Kristyn Ren, Rich Ren & Traci Ren in the Metro-Detroit area. All contributions made to his cause go directly to the care and future of Noah Holloway including insurance deductibles, co-pays, out of pocket expenses for treatments, medication and supplements not covered by insurance.

He especially likes when he gets to snuggle with his daddy. He and Daddy have a special bond between them.  He always sleeps with three stuffed animals and one is always the same. It’s a dog called Bolt from the Disney movie. He will rotate the other animals around but he always has Bolt.  In fact, Bolt is here in the hospital with us and it’s getting pretty ragged. He will always share whatever he has without question whether it be food or toys or anything.  When he gets in trouble or does something he shouldn’t, he is always the first to want to say sorry and mean it. There is not a mean bone in this little boy’s body.  Mommy and  Mayz have  a special relationship too. He will pick flowers out of the front yard or anywhere to give to Mom almost every day. He tells Mom that she is beautiful and that he loves her all the time. He’s even says, ""You are the best mommy in the whole world.""   He always wants to help Mom bring in the groceries, make dinner or cleanup. He is the first person to give you a hug when you are feeling sad. He plays baseball and loves his video games. He is a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Star Wars. Mayz also loves the Angels and his favorite player is Mike Trout. He even picked #27 for his jersey number this year.  Early in March 2018, Mayz had a simple headache and went to the Doctor. That simple headache turned out to be every parent's worst nightmare, a malignant brain tumor. On March 12th, he had surgery to remove his tumor, which Doctors were able to completely remove. Unfortunately during that surgery, it was found that he has small spots on the backside of his brain and spine. Mayz had another surgery a few days after to put in a small tube to let fluid be released more naturally. This is an alternative to getting a permanent shunt. We are hopeful that this procedure works so that we don’t have to have another one. Pathology came back with results on the tumor. It is Medulloblastoma “metastatic” meaning it’s trying to spread.  This explains the spots the doctor saw in his brain and on his spine. He is at high-risk and will most likely need radiation and chemo therapy, maybe even at the same time. We keep praying and staying positive for our little “ Warrior”. (Thanks to the Lozano family for this title!) Mayz misses his friends, family, and teammates and hopes to soon be able to run, jump and play with everyone. He is a fighter with a never give up attitude and we all believe in his ability to make a full recovery. In the meantime, the whole process has been extremely hard on not only him but his family.

Medical,35,"Please help our baby boy, Israel.",https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-our-baby-boy-israel,"NORMAL, IL","March 21, 2018","$150,000","$39,655","My wife Monica and I were ecstatic when we found out we were pregnant while overseas in Jerusalem, but on February 2nd our situation took a turn for the worse. Specialty doctors at the Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio have informed us that our unborn son, Israel, has an obstructed bladder. This complication has in turn caused a myriad of other problems including Chronic post-renal kidney failure (the kidneys aren’t functioning), a massive urinoma (fluid filled cyst in the stomach), almost complete lack of amniotic fluid (which is crucial for lung development), and slightly underdeveloped lungs (due to the lack of amniotic fluid). To combat this, we are now driving four and half hours to Cincinnati and staying in hotels weekly in order for my wife to receive amnioinfusins (infusing artificial amniotic fluid), as well as getting extractions from the urinoma in order to drain the cyst of fluid. We have been informed that we will need to continue doing this weekly for several weeks, at which point we will have to increase the visits to twice a week. Ultimately we will have to relocate to Cincinnati for the remainder of the pregnancy for inpatient care. Because of the kidney failure, our baby will almost undoubtedly need surgery when he is born so that he can undergo Peritoneal Dialysis for the first few years of his life, until eligible for a kidney transplant. Because of this dialysis we will have to spend approximately six more months in Cincinnati until we are finally able to bring our baby home.We have been fortunate enough to have very good health insurance, but insurance doesn’t cover everything, and unfortunately, things like the weekly amnioinfusions are being charged to us personally at $950 a piece, a week. My wife will also likely need to go on short term disability at some point. As a small business owner, my business and income has taken a hit due to constant weekly travel to Cincinnati. Doctors have notified us that Dialysis can cost between $50,000 - $80,000 a year. On top of the large expense for Dialysis, copayments for medical expenses, gas, food, and hotels in Cincinnati are beginning to pile up. Additionally, financial responsibilities back at home that are still prevalent including monthly car payments, mortgage, my shop payments, and expenses related to our other three children. With less time being able to work due to increased trips to Cincinnati, we have decided to reach out to this community for financial help. We have already had to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket and the financial burden is only increasing in both frequency and amount as time goes on – Feeling overwhelmed by this, we know we need a miracle. My wife and I humbly ask that if you find it in your heart to help financially, that you donate whatever you can towards helping us, and most importantly, little Israel with his hard journey ahead.We understand that this journey will take many years, but it is a journey that we are proud to walk and just want to give our little baby all the love, help, and hope he needs in the world, so again we humbly ask you to walk this journey with us. We will be strict in using any money donated for the procedures and help for Israel and the special care required after he is born. We are committed to providing photos and videos, as updates to keep everyone informed as we go along this journey. We also ask that you keep all of us, especially Israel in your constant thoughts and prayers. We ask that you please share this and our story with everyone you know if you feel compelled to do so. We will be forever truly and genuinely grateful for any and all help provided to us and already feel convicted to help others with similar problems in the future. To read more in detail about our entire story thus far, please read below. Thank you all so much for taking the time in reading this and God bless.Our Story Thus Far:On February 2nd, 2018, my wife, mother, father, and I anxiously went to the hospital to have our scheduled sonogram, which was to definitively determine the sex of our baby. A few minutes into the sonogram, with smiles lighting up our faces, the nurse asked to excuse herself so that she could retrieve the doctor. I vividly remember a tangible chill creeping down my spine as the nurse left the room as our bright smiles turned to confused and concerned blank stares. The doctor came into the room, looked at the sonogram, and asked me and my wife if we would like to hear some updated news she was about to tell us in front of my parents, or if we preferred it privately. Privacy didn’t matter to us at this moment, we both quickly exclaimed “Just tell us what’s going on with our baby”. The doctor’s face was not that of joy, but more of concern. She proceeded to tell us that there was a massive, unknown cyst where the left kidney should be, there was almost no amniotic fluid around our baby, and she was very concerned that our baby might not make it... just like that, in a single, unforgettable moment, the words that poured from the doctors mouth immediately flooded the entirety of the room. The blow from this knowledge was the most surreal, immediate, gut wrenching hit I have personally ever experienced in my life, blindsiding us in a life changing way on a day that started out with so much happiness and hope. After hearing these crippling words, my wife broke down and started crying. I remember thinking to myself “You have to take care of this women, she is your priority, you can worry about yourself later” I gently grabbed her hair, softly kissed her on the forehead and said, “I love you Monica, everything is going to be ok...”Nobody prepares you in life for how incredibly hard it is to make someone you love believe something that you yourself, at the bottom of your own heart don’t fully know or believe. I pride myself with being an integrity driven, honest man, but in that moment I just wanted to make her emotional pain stop - I said whatever I had to in order to make that happen. The doctor informed us that we would need to be transferred to Peoria’s Children’s Hospital for further testing. We left our hometown hospital after our appointment was finished and headed straight for Peoria. The drive there was completely silent, until we almost reached Peoria. I turned on a song called Here as in Heaven performed by Elevation Worship. At the end of this particular song, the lyrics “A miracle can happen now, for the spirit of the Lord is here” rang out in my car. For the first time, tears poured from my eyes, not in a sobbing way, but more of an uncontrollable leaking of emotion and fear from my eyes, completely silent, hand in hand with my wife, finally realizing and coming to terms with the severity of our baby’s situation, understanding that more than likely we would need a miracle.Once we got to Peoria, they ran a few more tests and told us that the situation for our baby did not look good at all. They informed us that one of their big concerns was this unknown giant mass of fluid where the left kidney should be and that since there was almost no amniotic fluid around the baby, the chances that the baby could compress his umbilical cord and completely choke it off was a real possibility. This was all the news they had for us during our initial visit. We were told that they would know more in ten days at our next appointment and sent us on our way back home. Those were the longest ten days of our lives, every morning dreading the answer when I asked Monica if she had felt the baby kick each morning, fearing for the worst. Ten days slowly crept by and we finally went back to Peoria. Doctors informed us that after yet another sonogram, the mass of fluid had grown, and there was nothing that they specifically could do. They told us that if we would like, they could contact specialists at the Children’s hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio to see what they could do. We promptly agreed. On the way home from Peoria, feeling defeated, we received a call from Cincinnati saying that they could get us in to see the specialists in a weeks’ time. So we packed our bags, reserved hotel rooms, and impatiently waited for more time to pass.The time had finally come for us to drive 4 and half hours to Cincinnati, and we couldn’t get there fast enough. We arrived Monday, February 19th in the evening, anxiously awaiting our appointment Tuesday morning at 7:30am. On Tuesday, my mother had flown in from Arizona where her and my father were visiting my brother and his wife. The three of us met a social worker and Urologist first thing on Tuesday. We were informed that Israel’s right kidney (the one they could actually see) had some micro cysts that were apparent, and one prominent cyst on it, possibly showing evidence of damage to the right kidney. We left the hospital that day feeling worse than we had before when we still had hope that the right kidney was working.That Wednesday, Monica had an MRI, an echocardiogram for the baby, and we had a team meeting with six other specialist and a handful of nurses. Walking into the conference room where the team meeting was being held was a little overwhelming and also eye opening to see just how dire the situation for our baby was. Seeing all those white coats in one room just waiting to talk to us personally was unnerving to say the least. The amazingly detailed staff explained to us that the MRI had shown that this mass was a urinoma, but that they didn’t fully know what the fluid was exactly yet. They informed us that the baby needs amniotic fluid around it (which our baby had close to none) for healthy lung development prior to birth. Without this development, life simply is not possible. They also informed us that there was a bladder obstruction which is what actually caused the urinoma. Doctors explained that the kidneys at the time they were functioning, got backed up because of the pressure of not being able to be released through the bladder. The blockage and backup is ultimately what caused damage to Israel’s kidneys. The staff informed us that we had the option to do nothing, which they are obligated to say. The doctors explained that doing nothing would mean almost certain death for Israel. A second option was given, to proceed with steps to counter these problems and come up with a plan. They informed us that if we decided to move forward with this, that this would more than likely be a very hard, long road to travel. I promptly made it clear to them all that this is a child, not just any child - it’s our child. This is a human being and we are going to fight as hard as we possibly can for this little one, no matter what strains or hardships are in store for our future. The doctors looked to each other as if to all be in understanding around the room that our decision was clear. After a brief pause, one of the doctors spoke up and said that if we were planning on moving forward, the first step would be to do a procedure that involves sticking a needle into Monica’s lower abdomen to extract the fluid from the urinoma. He further explained that the procedure would involve either pulling the needle out just far enough to infuse artificial amniotic fluid, or potentially utilizing an additional needle for the amino fusion. I asked him when he could perform this thinking to myself we would have to wait another week or so, but he promptly said “I can do this for you tomorrow”. My wife and mother immediately teared up and we all sincerely and genuinely thanked the specialists numerous times before leaving the room, my wife and mother hugging most of them as we left.Early Thursday morning, around 2:30am, I woke up, not able to sleep and opened up the Bible app on my phone. The first verse that came up was Genesis 32:22, where Jacob wrestled with God, and God renames him Israel. Since we found out we were pregnant while in Jerusalem, we had already considered naming our baby Israel, but after reading this passage on that nervous, early Thursday morning, I felt like I was wrestling with God through the current situation and like this baby was wrestling for his life. After discussing my thoughts further with Monica that morning we decided our baby’s name will be Israel. That morning my wife and I met my mother at the hospital and went in for the procedure. I remember being nervous, especially for my wife, but we knew we were in very good, very capable hands. The doctor explained to us that with this procedure, there is a low risk of premature birth or miscarriage, but a risk just the same, so Monica signed the waiver and he started. Seeing a doctor insert an 8 inch needle into your wife is unpleasant, and I can only imagine the physical feeling that it gave her was even more so, but I held her hand as he started the procedure, all the while, keeping my eyes glued to the sonogram monitor. The doctor ended up draining 120mls from the urinoma, which is about a half cup of fluid from this little baby’s stomach. I remember seeing how much fluid he extracted and just wondering to myself “how?” I then saw from the sonogram monitor the doctor pull the needle out just enough to position the tube where it needed to go in order to infuse the artificial amniotic fluid, and started to infuse. I honestly can’t tell you the feeling that swept over me as I saw this amazing doctor breath hope and life back into our child, even now writing this, it brings tears to my eyes. We could physically see this fluid rush in on the monitor, and our little creation of God immediately respond by moving his arms and legs, feeling the fluid that started to surround him, playing in it... It is a sight that I will never forget as long as I live.After the procedure, the doctor informed us that they would send off the fluid for testing and would have the results back in a couple weeks. He told us that we would have to return to Cincinnati weekly for these extractions and infusions, for the next month or two and that towards the end of the pregnancy, we would have to return twice a week ultimately having to relocate to Cincinnati for the rest of her pregnancy and possibly some time afterwards. We went back to the hotel so that Monica could rest before we had to travel the four and a half hours back home the next morning. I immediately started to think about the severity of how our lives were going to change and what we could do in order to adapt the very best way possible.Since then, we have gone back to Cincinnati every week. On the third visit they received the results of the fluid from the urinoma and told us that they are abnormal, meaning that the kidneys aren’t functioning properly and Israel will more than likely need to be put on peritoneal dialysis after he is born. This also means that we will have to stay in Cincinnati for an average of six months and that baby Israel will have to be hooked up to a dialysis machine for a few years until he is eligible for a kidney transplant. Monica and I will also have to take training classes in order to understand how to do everything properly once we are able to bring him back home with us. The doctors don’t know how the lungs will develop and as of right now, they are right below the low end of normal, so there is still hope on that front.Needless to say, this is a very stressful and overwhelming time for everyone involved, but there is no other option. I can’t not love my unborn son and refuse to do anything less than fight as hard as I can for him. Throughout this entire endeavor thus far, the one constant is Israel’s strong, beating heart, it is unwavering as is ours to do everything we can to love this child. We humbly ask that you keep us in your hearts and in your prayers, and that you share our story with everyone that you know. We will continue to have faith that ultimately, this little baby’s life is in God’s hands. We have been fortunate enough to have amazing support from friends and family and will without a doubt keep everyone that donates, prays, and who has helped in any way completely informed and updated. Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our story, God bless you all.",297,2.4k,12,334,5 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Even then, God placed a guardian angel with Jeff when a relative happened to be only a few cars behind. Once he identified Jeff, he used a crow bar to gain entry and pull him from his vehicle. Jeff was then med-flighted to Roanoke Memorial Hospital.￼￼Upon his admission, it was discovered Jeff had no feeling below his chest line. He had suffered what doctors called a catastrophic injury to his spinal cord as well as other acute injuries.Jeff’s medical team was able to stabilize his condition, but after further evaluation doctor’s suggested a surgery to stabilize and decompress Jeff’s spine. Roughly 24 hours after his initial arrival Jeff’s surgical team performed a procedure to insert a series of rods and screws into his spine. What doctors found during Jeff’s surgery was a complete spinal cord injury at his T2 vertebrae. His spinal cord was extremely inflamed and his dura shredded.While Jeff’s surgery was successful, he still remains in the ICU on blood pressure stabilization meidications and doctors were clear that it was unlikely that Jeff would ever walk again. As Jeff shifts modes to recovery we must pray that he is the one in a million that can beat the odds. However, as we pray and support Jeff in his journey, the interim is sure to be full of challenges.There will be many expenses associated with Jeff’s journey to recovery: hotels, meals, babysitters, dog sitters, travel, the list is longer than any of us can fathom.A dime, a dollar, a dozen - anything you can give to remove financial burden through these trying times is going to aide in Jeff’s recovery. And more important than pennies are prayers. Find time to pray as often as possible for Jeff, Sarah, Emma and their family.Thank you for being a part of Jeff’s Journey.

Born with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a rare and ""incurable"" liver disease, this special person felt compelled to enter an important service career and found out during a physical for that career that he had PSC. He was unable to pass the physical and began using intense holistic medicine. That cleaned him up short term and allowed him to become established in his career, but soon manifested into debilitating Ulcerative Colitis. He then lost extreme weight, was bleeding consistently, ended up in the hospital multiple times and almost lost his life. He tried several modern medicine regiments for years, including a chemotherapy but the drugs did not help and in some cases deteriorated his body and liver even more. With discipline and diligence he was able to alter his diet and follow an intense holistic regimen and just limp along in his job and life. The “cure” for PSC is a liver transplant, but the medical community will not even consider putting him on the transplant list due to the Ulcerative Colitis, so there is no cure in current medical protocols. This is a young man with a wife and small child! Not willing to accept a death sentence he did infinite research and found a clinic out of the country that has a very high success rate with actually healing and correcting his diseases with stem cell infusion therapy. Your donation to this fund saves a life, and for those that know him, an incredibly important life dedicated to helping us all.My son is the beneficiary for this campaign  He will be withdrawing the funds to pay for his upcoming medical treatments.  His first treatment is scheduled in early August at which time he must have $27K to cover the first round of expenses.

God is clearly in every person who visits, hugs, prays, brings coffee, sings over Rye, etc.""         Friday, April 27, God blessed us with postponing our Saturday plans.  Rye showed an appropriate response to pain.  He moved his shoulder when his shoulder was pinched hard intentionally by the physician (instead of inappropriately moving his leg, for example).  His eyes opened.  We count those moments as God's kindness in letting us see his eyes again and in giving doctors a reason to wait things out a bit.  Again, doctors are very honest about how small a sign that is scientifically.      So, we wait.  And we pray.  And we rejoice that we have this time with Rye's physical body here so that the beautiful body of believers can join us in the grieving, hoping, waiting, praying, crying, singing, laughing, eating, hugging, holding, touching walking, talking, etc.  We thank our Father that, Rye, who has no living grandparents and no relatives in the state has the biggest family ever imagined in the brothers and sisters in Christ who internationally are going before the throne of the Creator of the Universe daily on his behalf.  We know God can heal him here completely.  We pray He will.  Regardless, we trust His character that never changes and is always good, always for us, always faithful, always loving and always righteous.",158,985,2,160,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

It’s not everyday that you find out you have cancer. My name is Michelle Jannette Barroso, born and raised in San Francisco California and I just turned 48 years old this past June. I graduated from Immaculate Conception Academy, and then from Dominican College of San Rafael with my BSN. I am a registered nurse in Labor and Delivery at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View. I’m the wife of Eduardo Barroso who is a carpenter and works for the city of San Francisco for MUNI, and the proud mother of three beautiful children; Melissa and Loreto who are both in college, and Cheree who is in high school. On June 16th I was alarmed to find 11 pea sized lumps around my neck. So that following Wednesday I scheduled a doctors appointment, just to be safe and say I had it checked out. The following week on Junes 26th, we received the results of my biopsy. They told me they had found Adenocarcinoma, I had Cancer. We conducted the necessary diagnostic tests to find out how severe my case was and where exactly in my body the cancer was. We were so convinced we had caught it early, I felt normal, no side effects, my electrolyte and metabolic panels all came back within normal range. Looking at me, you never would have guessed.On my 21st Wedding Anniversary, July 5th, my family and I went to Kaiser and received the devastating prognosis. I have stage 4 Metastatic Adenocarcinoma, and it has spread throughout my body. It is in the lymph nodes throughout my body, my mediastinum, esophageal junction, my liver, pancreas, stomach, lower hip bones, and my pelvic bones. The doctor told me that without treatment that I have 6 months, up to a year. I have always had a positive outlook on life. I’ve always promoted the whole power of intention, power of attraction, the secret, etc. So naturally I’m trying to think positive, but I have to admit, I am super scared. I don’t know what my future holds. All I know is that I am not ready to leave this world.After some research we found that in my case, chemotherapy would only increase my presumed time by 5%. So this is my plea for help. I have found that there are cures for cancer in other countries, treatments that are not made available here in the United States. Since they are treatments not offered here, my insurance will not cover it. That is where this GoFundMe comes into play. Please help me with my cause, anything helps, even a dollar, whatever you can afford. I want to help in finding the cure, make a difference, and tell my story to the world.

And it can change everything. As many as you may know our beloved Kim Klonaris was diagnosed with lymphoma this July, shortly after she was in Nassau caring for her mother who is currently battling breast cancer. It was a heavy blow. At 42, and in excellent health, no one could have ever imagined this would be a part of Kim’s journey. Naturally, the family has been completely thrown into a whirlwind. The lymphoma is Marginal zone low grade b-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and requires aggressive chemotherapy treatments - including some hospitalization. We are so grateful because the prognosis is good. However, Kim had to make the very hard decision for her to leave her precious 8 year old daughter Eleni, husband Charles, family, church and friend support system as well as her home and begin rigorous chemo and medical treatments in the US for the next two and a half months. Kim and Charles run a small airfreight business on island and now Kim is unable to work. Insurance covers some of her treatment but not all costs. Some of her cancer medicines out of hospital are not covered nor is travel, food and accommodation costs for family members who will be looking after Kim. In just over two short months, Charles and Kim have spent well over 10K out of pocket. Anyone who has faced a similar battle knows only too well how quickly it all adds up. Kim and family have been long time members of the Lucayan Presbyterian Kirk and have always generously supported charitable causes in our wonderful Freeport Community. She and her family are so kind and humble, always giving. She and her family have never asked … nor will they ever ask … for help, even though they need it. Sometimes, though, we have to stand in the gap. So, on behalf of all of Kim and Charles’ family, friends and all who have asked how they can help, I’m asking. This is going to be a very tough battle for Kim and her family. Physically, emotionally and financially. Tremendous love and support are needed. So true to the village we Grand Bahamians truly are, there have been many calls, emails, texts, prayers and messages of love and support. Many have asked how they can help and, for those in a position to do so, a donation is a tangible way to help them in the journey ahead. Every donation, in any amount, helps and is so very much appreciated. We are grateful for whatever help you can give – donation or otherwise. Most importantly, please keep the prayers coming - Kim is so strong in her faith and has found great comfort in all the prayers, love and support she has already received…thank you! The unexpected does happen. Amazingly, in the midst of the toughest battles come the most extraordinary – and unexpected - displays of faith, strength, perseverance, support and love. And, that changes everything. Please feel free to share this post to your Facebook page in an effort to get the word out. Let’s support our sweet Kim and let her focus on getting better.

As Christian brothers and sisters we have a unique way to help “Carry each other’s burdens” as they face uncertain times.On March 23, 2018 Jim was diagnosed with carcinoma in the base of his tongue over two inches wide with metastasis to nearby lymph nodes. This was after just a few weeks of some headaches, a sudden painful lump in his neck, and problems swallowing.  He is currently under the care of a team of specialists who are assessing the treatment regimens available.  He has completed a full body PET Scan and results will be forthcoming about the extent of any metastasis below his neck.  He had minor surgery March 26 to assist in the diagnosis and will again undergo surgery April 2 to install a chemotherapy port in his chest.  Daily radiation is planned for 6 to 7 weeks along with chemotherapy at various intervals.  Monday April 9th has been targeted for the beginning of radiation and chemo therapies. He has been told he will lose up to 80 pounds and it may become necessary for a feeding tube to be installed in his abdomen. Even at this point, before any treatment, he is in significant pain and is on measured amounts of morphine around-the-clock as well as hydrocodone.As you can imagine, Jim has quite a rocky road of therapy and healing ahead of him. The treatments and the side effects that go along with them dictate that he will have to cut back on much of his work during the next 6 to 8 months.  The oncologist has prepared him for a potentially longer period of adjustment as there are simply too many unknowns to be precise at this point.  Some of you are aware of Jim’s history of heart disease and heart attack and his success in overcoming of those trials.  Now he is facing the battle for his life.Between the expenses of the planned treatment and reduced capability to work, several of his friends have encouraged this GoFundMe campaign. You can imagine one of the many unrelenting stresses for Jim and Annette will be these questions: how can we go forward financially? With no disability insurance, how can we pay our bills? Can we afford the right therapies? Can we continue paying our insurance premiums?  Can we meet the ever-rising deductible? – the list is endless.Yet this is one area where we ALL can come together and help relieve some of these nagging concerns. With your donation we can let Jim & Annette focus on healing and living – and not waste precious emotional energy on finances. They have already begun steps to simplify their lives. Jim realizes this will be a defining life moment and will likely change the course of it. Simplicity will be good. So, they are making meaningful changes already:  they recognize the dire necessity of drastically cutting living expenses, including the possible sale of of their home in the future.  They have already begun to sell several possessions while at the same time assessing future work realities – all with an eye toward a healthier, less stressful, future.   Over the years they have been supportive, welcoming, friends to so many of us in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, Arkansas, and, of course, Memphis. As we all pray for the Father to bless Jim and Annette with healing, each of us also has an opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to relieve some of their concern in this most anxious time. You may support Jim & Annette with cards and well wishes sent directly to them through Facebook messenger.Thank you for supporting Jim & Annette with your continued prayers over this extended time. Scott MillsWinston-Salem, NC Blair BryanCharlotte, NC  ""Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

Your donations will immediately be used to pay for this genetic test that could determine the best course of action to treat her cancer. This will hopefully help get her back into class with her kindergarten kids, who she misses so much.  Kellie is and will be facing expensive medical bills in addition to her rent, car payments, insurance and other expenses.  She has never been one to ask for help unless it's absolutely necessary.  Any and all money received in this Go Fund Me account will be used for the current, pending, and future expenses not covered so she may continue to lead a semi-normal life while trying to get the treatment and help she needs.  In keeping with her love for kids, Kellie has determined any and all unneeded funds will be donated to St. Jude's Children's Hospital, so others even younger than she will also get the help they need and deserve.      Kellie, her family, and friends thank you in advance for all of your support.",366,1.1k,0,369,6 months,3 months ago,6 months,2018-09-03

I am a 44 year old mother of three children (JJ-5, Nyah-9, and Izzy-17). I need HELP!!! I’m trying to raise $300,000.000, half of which I  need ASAP for a deposit. I desperately need a surgery, Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, known as HIPEC. HIPEC is an up and coming surgery to treat different forms of abdominal cancers. I have a very rare and aggressive form of ADRENAL CANCER called Adrenal Cortical Carcinoma (ACC).  ACC is called a “Terrorist” cancer, an “Orphan” cancer. ACC is relentlessly aggressive and extremely rare. I have limited treatment options and very little time. I have been battling with ACC for 2 years. I am statistically approaching the end of my road. My Oncologist and I have exhausted every conventional form of treatment for my ACC. We started with surgery combined with radiation therapy and it returned in less than 2 months. After my recurrence in July of 2017, we hit it with almost a year of intense chemotherapy. A 3 chemo cocktail that has left me disabled and suffering from a pulmonary embolism. The embolism ended my remaining systemic chemo treatments. My tumors have responded well to the chemo, and there has been significant shrinkage, but the 4 tumors are still in the peritoneal lining of my abdomen. During HIPEC, what is left of my tumors will be removed, then Dr. Miller will apply heated chemo directly into my abdomen. I will be the very first ACC patient to be treated with HIPEC at the University of Michigan Cancer Center.  This treatment can give me years instead of months. Without this surgery, I will not live long enough to see my two youngest children finish grade school. I have insurance, my husband and I purchased our heath insurance through the ACA Marketplace, and I am grateful to the ACA. Without its protections for pre-existing conditions I wouldn’t have had the last 2 years with my family. Unfortunately, treatments provided out of network and out of state ARE NOT COVERED. Like I said before, my cancer is extremely rare and very aggressive, less than one in a million rare, and only three surgeons in the United States perform this surgery for ACC patients. I have started this Go Fund Me page because, like I said, my insurance won’t cover this cancer-busting procedure, and I am running out of time.With your help in funding this surgery, to be done by the ADRENAL CANCER research team at University of Michigan, HIPEC is my opportunity and small window to be with my family for hopefully many more years. I have hope, my family has hope, that I can actually beat this cancer, but soon the tumors will become too large and HIPEC will no longer be a viable option.  We are not a family to easily ask for help, but cancer changes your perspective on many things. Please help us by donating. Every little bit helps in a big way.FINANCIAL GOAL:Our financial goal is $300,000.00. A jaw dropping amount of money, but the surgery is expensive. Your donations in any amount will help cover the following:-Travel expenses between Phoenix, Arizona & Ann Arbor, Michigan-HIPEC Surgery, a 12-14 hour surgery-8 to10 days in the ICU and the hospital-Follow up visits for 2 weeks after my release from U of M, with my ACC specialist, Dr. Gary Hammer, and my surgeon, Dr. Barbra Miller. -Medication,Tests, and imaging-Accommodations for myself and my family for 4 to 5 week stay in Ann Arbor   -Paid help for me, and childcare for Nyah and JJ, as recovery is estimated at 6-9 months.",270,825,11,281,1 month,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I know, from private conversations, he truly looks at these kids and parents as extended family members.  He truly loves watching all kids succeed-not just his own.  Xiomara has opened up her home to many families throughout the year and has willingly picked up the duties at home when Fred was spending a great deal of time helping others.  Lani, Fred and Xiomara are in need of all of our help.  Many loved ones are offering support in many ways and the last week has been incredible to see in terms of how good people can be when a family is brought to their knees.   The financial cushion that we are trying to raise will allow Fred and Xiomara to focus on Lani without the stress of worrying about finances.Lani is an incredible  soccer player who has excelled on the field as well as in the classroom.  Her smile is infectious and her good natured spirit has touched many.  She will beat this illness and come back stronger than ever!!!",328,1.2k,11,326,11 days,2 days ago,9 days,2018-09-03

Subsequently, he required a lifesaving surgery where the doctors had to remove part of the skull to allow his brain to swell without causing any more damage. Currently he has limited movement on the left side of his body, but he was able to say his name and give his wife Cara a high five. He has a feeding tube but hopefully it will come out soon!!  The next step is at least 6 more weeks in the hospital, an intense couple of weeks of stroke therapy at an inpatient facility and most likely followed by an extended stay in a professional nursing facility where he will continue therapy until he is able to go home. We have a very long road ahead of us, but Jody has an AMAZING, MAGICAL, UNBELIEVEABLE group of friends and family that surrounds him.  With all that said, even with insurance medical bills can be a HUGE financial burden.

I'm here to ask you for your prayers and help as Andrew begins his brave journey to fight and BEAT Burkitt's Leukemia. Just three weeks ago, Melissa and Chris took Andrew to their pediatrician to diagnose and treat a lump on the side of his face. After two rounds of antibiotics and several stumped doctors, Andrew was admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Days later, a battery of tests confirmed that he has stage four blood cancer.  Andrew received the first of many upcoming chemo treatments on Friday, March 30. Because the cancer is aggressive, doctors have put him on a chemo treatment plan that will last six to eight months, with most of his  time being spent at CHOP. We are optimistic that at the end of Andrew's journey, he will stand tall, proud, victorious and ready to continue his life as a survivor. In order for Melissa and Chris to provide the full time care and love so critical to Andrew's healing process, they need to work reduced hours, thus immediately foregoing their full time salaries for the duration of Andrew's treatment and recovery. To help them cover the lost wages and Andrew's increasing costs of medical care, I am kindly asking for your generosity. Every thought, prayer, positive vibe, and contribution will help Andrew stay strong and WIN. On behalf of the Trouts, Branyans, Tieders, and Andrew's extended family, I sincerely thank you for your show of support and standing by Melissa, Chris and Andrew's brothers, Conner (eight) and William (five) during this trying time.

The funds will be spent for the medical bills that cannot covered by their insurance, recovery cost they need after surgery, to help with daily expenses until he is able to go back to work, to help to heal their hearts, to help to heal both physically and mentally distressed. Also, please share this with family and friends as a warning that we all must be careful and vigilant of our surroundings.  This could have happened to anyone.  Masashige was truly in the wrong place at the wrong time!ハワイ在住のShokoと申します。2018年5月28日にカカアコ地区で日本人観光客のご家族に起きた暴行事件。私は当時、たまたま子供達を連れて事件の起こった公園に入った時ちょうど事件が起きた直後でした。遠くから見て、男性1人が血まみれで座り込んでおり周りにいた3名の方もパニック状態でいるのがすぐにわかったと同時に日本人観光客とすぐにわかったので、大丈夫ですかと声をかけました。そこから、ご家族と警察、救急隊員、病院のナースなど通訳としてヘルプさせて頂きながら事件の全てそしてご家族の状況を目の当たりにしました。ご家族はハワイ滞在最終日に、最近話題になっているカカアコ地区のウォールアートを見に来ていて、お父様の正茂さんがたまたま入った公園のトイレで事件が起きました。正茂さん曰く、トイレに入って間もなく襲われたそうでその瞬間から記憶が全くありません。様子がおかしい事に気付いた奥様の美穂さんがすぐに確認しようと後を追いましたがトイレに入る直前で別の誰かに背後から首を絞められその場で気絶してしまいました。息子さんと娘さんはこの時幸いにも公園外のウォールアートの写真をとっていて、事件後に駆けつけたそうです。正茂さんと美穂さんは救急車で緊急搬送され、応急処置や検査などを受けた後、約10日間程の入院になりそうと診断されました。正茂さんの怪我の状態:頬の骨陥没おでこ左側深い切り傷歯茎から折られる頭を支える骨にヒビが入った為、髄液が流出両目とも開かない程腫れがる精神的ダメージ美穂さんの怪我の状態:唇の損傷 首、顔面のあざ顔面の痛み精神的ダメージ今すぐにでも手術が必要とされる中、不運にも海外旅行保険に加入されていなかった為に莫大な治療費となってしまい、事件翌日の飛行機で怪我を負ったまま日本へ帰るしかない状況に置かれてしまいました。幸いにも無事に日本に到着し、空港からまっすぐ病院へ向かい、正茂さんは緊急入院となりました。検査の方も進み、思った以に酷い状況であることが発覚し、次の手術予定日が6月9日と決まっています。集まった募金は私が責任を持って100%全て田村さんご家族に送ります。保険適用にならない分のハワイでかかった治療費、病院代、手術後の手当て、心の治療、お仕事に復帰できるようになるまでの日々のコストなど、そしてお見舞金として使われる予定です。私の周りのローカル達が、田村さんご家族の為にたくさんのアロハを送ってあげようと言ってくれて一緒に決めたゴール金額です。せっかくの家族ハワイ旅行でまさかこんな事件にあってしまうなんて、誰も想像すらできません。ハワイ在住の方、日本在住の方、世界中の方々、1円でも構いませんのでどうかサポートして頂けると嬉しいです！募金で集まった金額100%全て田村さんご家族に寄付されます。どうかよろしくお願いいたします。",719,7.5k,8,708,3 months,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Many of you are personal friends of Faith and are familiar with her story and love her dearly. We absolutely need a miracle for Faith in the next couple of weeks. For those of you who have or have not followed Faith’s healing journey here’s what’s happening: Faith needs your financial help! There is nothing more that her Oncologist or Surgeon can do for her, she is in the lates stages of Stage 4 Mestatic Breast Cancer. Because it has already metastasized, ( spread to her spine ) It has the potential to spread very quickly to her major organs, it’s hard to say exactly how long she has. She is in the process of phasing our out of her job, as her health is seemingly declining. We don’t know how long she has, it could be just a series of months. Needless to say she is in need of a miracle. Faith has been accepted as a patient for experimental treatment at CHIPSA Hospital. This treatment will cost $33,427.17 This will cover 3 weeks of inpatient treatment, 3 meals a day, her own room, and covers the cost of an extra room and 3 meals a day for her travel companion. CHIPSA hospital has a lot of long standing integrity with Cancer.  https://chipsahospital.org/Faith has chosen this hospital because of the many first hand reports she has heard through the years in regard to their high results with cancer. CHIPSA has much higher results with cancer treatment for individuals with compromised immune systems........Of these Therapies are two in particular: IPT and the Vallovax Vaccine. IPT is low dose chemo assisted with Insulin, because cancer cells have more insulin receptors on them than healthy cells the chemo bypasses the healthy cells and only kills the cancer cells! Yay ! No hair falling out ! The Vallovax vaccine has received a lot of media coverage lately. 80-95% of clinical trials are seeing cancer patients with late stage disease with a clean bill of health, and with no side effects?! CHIPSAs hospital is only 23 miles south of sandiego, just over the border in Tiujuana. Faith has interviewed with her agent Kim, in addition to Dr Castillo her attending Physician. They have offered her 3 week opening available immediately. She has been approved for a comprehensive late stage cancer treatment program. She is most encouraged about the Vallovax Vaccine , it is anti angiogenic in nature and it is destroying cancer by: “reducing the growth of new blood vessels needed by tumors to grow and metastasize” It basically starves the tumors from their energy source and they die! The hospital is reporting that patients aren’t needing as much IPT because the Vallovax vaccine is having so much substantial success ! Overview- ( for those who need the back story) Faith was Diagnosed in July 2017 with stage 4 Breast Cancer. Faith’s White Blood cell count was dangerously low prior to starting any treatment. Her Oncologist says she has a condition called Leukopenia. This is where your white cell count is so low that even your own bodies bacteria can become dangerous to you. This makes Faith a risky candidate for chemo, Chemo greatly reduces your white blood cell count. Many people do not realize that it’s not the chemo that kills off the entirety of the cancer, it is the immune systems job to do so. I share this to clarify why Faith was never a candidate for typical Cancer therapy. Faith also has had a 9 year history of complicated auto immune diagnoses, there were years when she was so ill she couldn’t work. So now you have a better idea of why she needs to pursue this experimental treatment. Please consider donating or becoming a fundraiser yourself . If 350 people could find a way to raise 100$ from their friends and family , we could knock this out as quickly as possible and potentially save her life ! Sadly this is a life and death situation. We ask that everyone please share this post and more specifically if you would consider being a fundraiser yourself and gathering funds from you’re circle. If we get to the $35,000 mark Faith can go immediately...let’s get it done in three days and save her life!!",268,1.3k,5,303,2 months,4 days ago,2 months,2018-09-03

There are only a few doctors and hospitals in the world that can, to this day,  perform the surgery because of its complexity.  Dr. Evan Zahn is his doctor (currently based in Cedar Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles)who together with Redmond Burke saved his life in1999. As a matter of fact, his condition was so rareback then and his odds for survival so low, that theMiami Herald published an article about him titled“A miracle of the Heart”. We gave everything forhim, not only emotionally, but also financially.Juan’s birth was supposed to be one of joy, the firstgrandson in our family. His mother was fully covered by insurance, but things changed radically when Juan was born with an undetected congenitaldisease. All of these medical procedureswere out of pocket expenses, since the insurancecompany denied coverage due to his congenitalcondition. After two open heart surgeries andseven catheterisms, plus the loss of sight in one of his eyes he needs another intervention.Two days ago we got the hospital’s quotation for his procedure. $89,000.00 We are not financially prepared for that and are turning to you to support us in finding themanner in which we might raise the necessary funds.  A child’slife, an amazing child’s life is at stake. We beg you, from our hearts,from my families’ and from our country of El Salvador’sprayers, where Juan has been an example of resilience, faithand hope, to help us. These funds will be used to paybfor his procedure  scheduled to bebon July 17 2018 Mi nombre es Adriana Hill y soy de El Salvador. Mi sobrino Juan Fernando Salaverria es un joven de 18 años que nació con Tetralogía de Fallo, ausencia de válvula pulmonar y de una arteria pulmonar. En la segunda semana de julio de este año debe de someterse a un cateterismo para poder reemplazar la válvula pulmonar que actualmente tiene. Solo hay un par de doctores en el mundo que actualmente realizan este procedimiento debido a su complejidad. El Dr. Evan Zahn es el doctor de Juan Fernando (actualmente trabaja en el Cedar Sinaí Hospital de Los Ángeles) quien junto con el Dr. Raymond Burke salvaron la vida de Juan Fernando en 1999. La condición con la que nació Juan Fernando era tan rara y su probabilidad de sobrevivir tan baja que el Miami Herald publicó un artículo sobre  llamado ""Un Milagro del Corazón"". Desde ese momento sus padres y el resto de su familia han dado todo para sacar adelante a Juan Fer no solo emocionalmente pero también  económicamente. Al momento de nacer, la mamá de Juan Fernando contaba con seguro médico, pero al ser la enfermedad de índole congénita, las cosas cambiaron drásticamente. Todos los procedimientos a los que se ha sometido Juan Fernando han sido pagados al 100% por la familia ya que la aseguradora le negó cobertura alguna. Después de dos cirugías de corazón abierto, siete cateterismos y la perdida completa de un ojo, Juan Fer necesita otra intervención. Hace unos días recibimos la cotización del hospital por el procedimiento $89,000.00.  No estamos preparados económicamente para esta situación por eso buscamos de su apoyo para encontrar la manera de poder ayudar a Juan Fernando. En nombre de nuestra familia agradecemos su apoyo, sus oraciones y su cariño para nuestro Juan Fer.

It may also serve as a platform for those to show love and support to baby Rowan and those who go above and beyond to care for him.  Those who choose to support through V E N M O: @mwhaynesOur fight with cancer: Our son, Rowan, was diagnosed with stage III Ganglioneuroblastoma at 15 months of age on March 2nd, 2018. An intermixed mass of cancerous and benign cells forming a tumor larger than a grapefruit was growing in his pelvis out toward his abdomen.  After two cycles of chemotherapy, the cancer was unresponsive and the only treatment left was surgery. On April 26th, the amazing surgical staff at Miller Children’s Hospital in Long Beach was able to perform a miracle. They took out 90% of the mass even though it was incasing his aorta and inferior vena cava. While considered overly successful, they could not safely remove the mass inside his spinal column and sacrum.Our fight isn’t over:  While the best possible outcome was achieved during surgery, our battle with cancer is far from complete. Depending on the type of tissue that still remains in his body and how well he recovers from surgery, he will still need a lot of treatment. He might need additional chemotherapy and maybe even radiation. Rowan will eventually need physical, occupational, and speech therapy to catch up on his milestones. Our oncology team estimates that his treatment will take anywhere from 6-12 months; we have been in the pediatric intensive care unit for only two months so far. As of April 28, 2018, he is still fighting hard in the surgical recovery stage of his treatment roadmap.Why we need your support: Plainly stated, we want to be able to ensure Rowan is being well taken care of. We also want to be able to support those who go out of their way to care for him. Rowan requires us to be by his side at all times in the hospital so we won’t be actively earning income. These donations will help us maintain his care and comfort. My awesome employer has given my family so much already, but those amazing benefits cannot last forever. All monies donated will be used for the treatment, care, comfort, and support of Rowan and those who care for him.For more detailed information on our son’s condition and treatment, scroll down for the whole story.The Haynes Family thanks you from the bottom of our hearts!Feel free to contact me at matthewhaynes@kpmg.com or mhaynes15@yahoo.com￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The Story: We took Rowan to our pediatrician on March 1st, 2018 because he was being extremely fussy during the past week. He wouldn’t eat, sleep, or crawl. Rowan would just whimper instead. We thought it was an ear ache and teething but our doctor was more concerned about how bloated his belly was. She ordered tests: blood, stool, and an ultrasound.  Later that evening around 7 o’clock, we got a call from her telling us to go to the ER because Rowan's lab results were extremely abnormal. Most notably, his calcium was >15mg/dL (Severe hypercalcemia). That trip to the ER would change our lives forever.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Soon after we get to the ER, an abdominal ultrasound revealed that he had a huge mass growing in his belly.  We were admitted to the Pediatric ICU. From there, as if almost on cue, he started to developed severe diarrhea. He would end up losing about 3 to 4 liters of stool everyday.  Confounded by what could be causing the stooling, the PICU team could only treat the extreme electrolyte imbalances and dehydration until the MRIs would reveal what was truly inside. After a week, the MRI was presented to us by the pediatric oncology team. The mass was a lot larger than expected and appeared to be growing from his sacrum to his belly button; it was 12x10x12cm. It was compressing his stomach and bladder, and pushing his intestines toward his ribs. Tumor and bone marrow biopsies needed to be taken in order to give us a definitive diagnoses. Our worst fears came to fruition.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The diagnosis was Ganglioneuroblastoma: Stage III Cancer.  It is a very rare cancer that has benign and malignant growths intermixed. The cancer was also emitting a hormone (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) that caused him to have severe diarrhea; even if he had nothing to eat or drink, he would still have watery stool. At the time, the edpidemiologists thought the dysentery was from a contagious disease, so Rowan was put on isololation for most of the time. In essence, he was forced to stay in his crib for weeks, which was horrible. The diarrhea posed a huge challenge because it resulted in Rowan having his blood tested every four hours so that they could replace his electrolytes and fluids. Eventually, he had to have a semi-permanent central line placed under his collar bone for easy access to blood and meds. He also had a feeding tube inserted through his nostril.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The plan of attack was to have two cycles of chemotherapy then check to see if the tumor had shrunk. Surgery would have been the first option but the surgical team was worried that the tumor was too vascular (bloody) and chemotherapy would hopefully kill some of the vasculature.  So, we treated the cancer with two rounds. A total of 42 days worth of inpatient therapy in the pediatric oncology ward. Eventually, Rowan's instability would bring us back to the Pediatric ICU where we would call home for most of the stay. They treated him as well they could.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼After the first round of chemotherapy, preliminary signs indicated that the tumor was not shrinking and everything we did to slow the stooling wasn't working. We continued to give his second round of chemotherapy with different drugs to ensure that we covered all angles. After many blood transfusions, anti-nausea/pain medications, and diaper changes later, we finally take another MRI to see the results of chemo. In short, the results were not good. The MRI indicated that the tumor was unresponsive and actually grew just a few CMs. This was a hard pill to swallow. What was even more devastating was the MRI revealed that the tumor mass was incasing the two main arteries from the heart. The tumor was also being fed blood by three other arteries. This news was devastating to us. The only bright side was that flu restrictions were lifted and Rowan’s big sister, McKenzie, got to see him for the first time after two months.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼The remaining treatment was surgery; to get as much of the mass out of him as possible. The problem was that removing the mass could be lethal and that only 50% could be taken out safely.  On April 26, 2018 Rowan endured a 6.5 hour surgery that required every pediatric surgeon in the hospital. We were told that 5 surgeons worked simultaneously on him. We were blessed and relieved that a miracle was performed that day and 90% of the tumor was removed. Everyone's prayers and support and love and kindness were answered. Tears of joy were shed by family, nurses, and doctors alike that day. But our battle is far from over. Only a few days into his recovery we are seeing the struggle that remains. He has a long road ahead with treatment to follow. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼We will keep you all updated!Thank you from the very bottom of our hearts.",408,547,32,405,4 months,18 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

They could not figure out why and did a spinal surgery thinking that was it. She kept getting weaker and had a fall in Dec 2016, breaking her ankle in three places. In early 2017, she continued losing mobility and by September she could no longer stand. In September, they finally gave us the diagnosis but it was definitely not what we were hoping for...it is ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease). They say the average lifespan from the first symptoms is 2-4 years and we can definitely see the progression as she is almost bed bound 24/7. But Mary is still dedicated to trying to ‘Stephen Hawking‘ the crap outta this!The cost of paying for a full time caregiver is pretty incredible and we are still on the waiting list to get Medicare to pay for some of it. In addition to Mary's healthcare costs, she has started her inevitable decline, being mostly bedbound every day, losing the use of even her hands, and now her voice is becoming difficult to understand clearly. She also is needing respiration in order to sleep and keep oxygen flowing properly.  Ted has to work during the day to keep the ship afloat.  And after buying a handicapped van in October, the medical expenses are starting to mount again for us.If you are in a position to help, it is super appreciated.  We are thankful that we have a full lifetime to remember together.  Living in London, helping her get into Stanford, working at our startup GoTo together, years of watching our kids grow up. Now that she has pretty much only her memories left, we are dedicated to helping her as much as we are able. Thank you her friends and family for all of the laughter and memories.  Mary is dedicated to helping others even in this difficult time - and we've put together a blog with all her lists of life tips .  Check it out!You can also check out this amazing video that a close friend had made at our Team Mary party.  It's a very touching way to see how Mary has touched all our lives.Sending love from Mary.",74,22,3,73,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

In January, Laura’s scans showed that there was no evidence of disease. Despite this, Laura was adamant that another scan be taken in mid-August to confirm that she was cancer free. While doctors noted an additional scan wasn’t needed, her persistence won and the scan was performed.As a shock to us all, on August 23, 2018 Laura and Michael received the devastating news that the scan showed a concerning spot on her liver. Laura’s doctors are confident that this lesion signifies a recurrence of her cancer and therefore, at the beginning of September, Laura will have the lesion removed and sent out for testing. This recurrence would put her at stage 4 cancer which means that more creative methods need to be put into place to ensure Laura has the strongest possibility to beat this. So many people have reached out to show their love and support, and to ask about ways they can help. This Go Fund Me Page is a way to help Laura and Michael access the care, resources, and lifestyle they need to give them all the strength to continue to fight like hell. Beyond cancer being devastating, it is expensive. Insurance will cover the scans, the surgeries, etc. but ALL other supplementary expenses are out of pocket. New costs pop up every day, but here is what we know they can expect soon. Those costs that are known for certain are listed below, however there are some costs we are not exactly sure of yet. Western Medicine- COBRA costs due to Laura carrying the insurance prior to the loss of her job earlier this year ($1600/month)- Flights to and from hospitals for second opinions, treatment, etc. (airline tickets will cost at least $300 each time they travel, not including hotel costs and other costs associated with being away from home)- Research on her lesion performed by Foundation One (a sample of her lesion will be sent out for testing to determine the type of cancer she is dealing with so she can best fight it)- Functional medicine expenses - A consult Dr. Nasha Winters who uses natural medicine to target stage 4 cancer successfully ($500 for just the consult, not including ongoing treatment) Eastern Medicine- Acupuncture 2x a week ($31 each session)- Natropath doctor visits twice a month ($200 each visit)- A treatment facility to focus on detoxification and finding the root cause of her cancer (approx. $10K, depending on the facility)- Research by Sator Therapeutics – Cost is TBD but likely in the thousands (this is a personalized approach to treatment in Europe that would allow Laura to receive a customized treatment based on her specific type of cancer)  - Additional exploratory medicine expenses that arise (This will be the driving cost of treatment going forward as Laura needs to determine the root cause of her cancer and be vigilant in her approach to treatment)- Mistletoe injections ($180 monthly)Lifestyle- Regular massage treatments ($40 each session)- Organic groceries weekly in lieu of a meal train or other meals dropped off ($200) – Laura is on a very strict diet and this will allow her to maintain it- Supplements ($180 a month)Despite the stage 4 diagnosis, Laura and Michael are confident that they can beat this. People live for many years and go into remission with this diagnosis, but this type of success requires a lot of work, exploration, alternative medicine, and the expenses that go along with it all. This Go Fund Me page will help to ensure that Laura and Michael can focus on her treatment and have relief from some of the expenses that will come their way in the future Following the removal of this mass in early September, we will know, for certain, if this is cancerous. Because the doctors believe it is, we would like to give Laura and Michael a jump start on the upcoming expenses.

He's a tall boy for his age and the risk of injury is high for both him and caregivers. Getting a van with the right equipment will help transfer him more safely than out of a car seat in a typical vehicle. Kids like Nick have bulky, heavy medical equipment, and if it's not used as intended, expensive repairs are needed. This happens when components that aren't intended to be broken apart need to be in order to fit into a car to go to multiple appointments, sometimes in the same day. Nick's family has some important visits to the Seattle Children's Hospital scheduled later in the summer with  specialists and they have to bring equipment that doesn't fit in their car.Nick's family will soon be selling their small SUV and hope to buy an adaptive van, but they need your help.RECENT VISIT TO DEALER TO SEE HOW NICK'S CHAIR FITSThis is Nick's story, told by his Mom and Dad:In June of 2016, my husband and I received a phone call that a little boy was born many states away to an unprepared mother and that the baby needed a family. We had been chosen for the task if we could quickly decide to take him. After a surprisingly short discussion and a long flight to meet him, it was obvious that Nick was meant to be our son. Because we had gotten him ""overnight"", our community rallied around us and started delivering clothing, strollers, a crib; almost everything we needed showed up miraculously at our doorstep in those early days.A few short months later, our perfect baby started to slip in meeting milestones and started exhibiting what medical professionals called ""hypertonicity"". He was unable to turn his head easily to the left and his leg and arm muscles were consistently tight. He also started having issues bottle feeding and he barely slept. The hardest part about the first few months was not knowing what was happening with him and feeling like we weren't giving him what he needed. Typical new parents, right? What we didn't know at that time is that Nick's brain had suffered a stroke early on in the pregnancy and he had a condition called bilateral schizencephaly  with polymicrogyria . When we received his diagnosis at 6 months of age, we were told that he probably wouldn't walk and that controlling his seizures and muscle tone would be life-saving as he grew.NICK'S FIRST EEG, WHERE HIS SEIZURE DISORDER WAS CONFIRMEDThe first year of his life was deeply disorienting for us and filled with hospital admissions, trips to the ER, trials and errors with feeding tubes, procedures, tests, sleepless nights and mastering a whole new vocabulary. We learned the difference between OT and PT, balanced appointments in the home and in-clinic and we signed him up for every service we could afford, leveraging the Early Intervention's Birth to 3 services. As his mother, I was unable to return to work and filled my time with going to support groups, hiring dependable caregivers and even attending seminars about neuroplasticity. Kids like Nick need help re-wiring the brain to use their muscles, including those supporting vision, so they can have hope for some sort of ""normal"" life.NICK AFTER HIS FIRST MEDICAL PROCEDURE TO GET A FEEDING TUBE, HELD BY DADAs symptoms of his brain disorder, Nick has cerebral palsy, intractable epilepsy, cortical vision impairment and other symptoms like trouble swallowing and digesting food. He doesn't use any words to communicate. He's followed by over 15 doctors and we see 6 therapists - Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, Vision Therapists - either weekly or monthly either in our home or in clinics.What my husband's health insurance doesn't cover has been paid out of pocket so far. Big expenses are looming because he's such a big boy and because he can't help us move him at all.  Expensive things like adding tracks in the ceiling to support his weight as we move him safely from one room to an adaptive bathroom - not yet built - or removing steps and replacing them with ramps to roll his chair. We need to find a space in home to accommodate durable medical equipment like his activity chair, an adaptive stroller or foam wedges to support him during vision therapy. He'll soon get a ""stander"" to help him bear weight so his hips can develop enough to avoid surgery.TWO OF THE PIECES OF LARGE EQUIPMENT WE NEED TO TRANSPORTThe tricky thing about medical equipment is that it's bulky and heavy. Not only do we need to protect our bodies as he grows but we need to protect the integrity of the equipment by not breaking it down when it needs to go with him to appointments. The retail cost of one of his pieces of equipment alone is over $7,000 and if it breaks, there are limited options for loaners. The process of getting the blue chair in the picture above through the local children's hospital, including insurance approvals, took almost 7 months!We've waited as long as possible to buy an adaptive van to safely transport Nick and his heavy medical equipment. Soon, he won't sit in a car seat and instead, his chair will be strapped down inside a van for transport. By purchasing a properly adapted one, we'll be able to roll Nick into it and reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the chairs. If you have ever shopped for a van, you know that they can be costly. If you add the conversion package, the cost is between $60,000 to $80,000 for a new one. The conversion offers essential features for families like ours, like:-    A wheelchair ramp that automatically retracts from the vehicle after the van is lowered closer to the ground. You might have seen this with buses being lowered to accommodate a passenger with physical limitations. -    Modular seating that can be easily removed to add space for large equipment or a disabled passenger in the front when they're old enough. Why should a person who would typically ride up front be pushed to the back of a van simply because they can't open a door and sit in the front seat?-    Illumination on the floors to see where you're working on tying down chairs or when you drop things like syringes while meds are administered.We've been setting aside money to buy the van but other expenses are adding up:  adapting our home, hiring additional caregivers so we can both work to afford therapies and treatments. So, we're asking for some help. We're lucky to have a fair, family-run and owned local dealership  in our area but we really need some help putting part of the money down to be able to afford the monthly payment.It's very hard to ask for help so publicly but we've been encouraged to do so by some of his doctors and therapists and we all need help from time to time.Thank you listening to our family's story and for your support. Even if you can't contribute financially, sharing our story with your friends and family or leaving a kind note is always appreciated. You can share the link by email, phone, Facebook or Twitter:   www.gofundme.com/VanforNick. Or, you can just use"" share buttons"" and mention why Nick's story inspired you to donate or share.Thank you again,Nick's Mom and Dad, Nick J.",306,1.1k,17,302,2 months,12 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

The next day, she suffered from a 104-degree fever, a headache, nausea, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea. She was taken to urgent care, where they eventually couldn’t find a blood pressure, and then she was rushed to the emergency room.Somehow, Diane had contracted an infection during the sinus surgery that had quickly become septic(bacterial infection in blood stream). She was taken into an emergency surgery, where her entire large colon and part of her small bowel were removed. She then spent almost two weeks in the ICU, unable to see her sons, and was taken back to surgery for an illeostomy and given a feeding tube (peg) as well. She wasn’t able to speak again until she was extubated on June 17th—her first words were, ""Happy Father's Day.""Because the infection became septic so drastically, Diane no longer has use of her fingers and feet, but she can currently stand briefly on her left foot. She struggles through having her wounds dosed with alcohol, wrapped, and unwrapped multiple times a day. She is also still suffering from a swollen small intestinal area with gas and stomach pains, a clogged feeding tube, anxiety, and minimal sleep. She is enduring physical therapy trying to regain mobility with hopes of returning home to her boys, husband, and the community that she knows and loves.The doctors are advising amputation. There is a possibility of hand transplants and a right below-the-knee amputation, as well as an partial amputation on her left foot. The doctors are also hopeful that more can be done to improve her small intestine, bar any more infections or setbacks. However, most of the above won’t be covered by her insurance or social security. The current estimate for what she’d have to pay out of pocket is over $500,000.The insurance will pay to put Diane in a nursing home, but refuses to pay for at-home health care, prosthetics, or the necessary procedures. The worst case would be Diane being placed in a nursing home at 35 years old, where she could only get visitation from her boys and husband after school and work, but would no longer be able to live with them. The family has yet to hear back from Medicaid, but we’re hoping that Diane will be accepted so that she and her sons can have some insurance if she were no longer to have insurance from her job due to her condition.We are asking for donations to this GoFundMe page to help pay off her medical bills that the insurance won’t cover, and for the ability to receive any prosthetics or at-home care she’s going to need moving forward.Thank you for reading, and thank you in advance for anything you can give.  Any little bit will help, even something as small as the price of a cup of coffee.  Please share to spread the word even if you can’t help monetarily!We thank God for His many blessings and that Diane is alive and can still hug her boys with her arms and talk to them. Through this whole ordeal her faith in God and multiple prayer group-support from Open Door Church, where she volunteers and where her boys to go to school and support has been a tremendous help. We thank everyone who has prayed and for the many churches across North Carolina, her family, and her friends that have gotten her this far.All funds raised will be withdrawn in a special bank account on behalf of Diane and the family.  Paula Loftin will work to oversee the withdrawals of the funds.",345,2.3k,15,338,1 month,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

As of this new posting, we have collectively raised about $32,000 to support our longtime friend and favorite bartender in his most challenging year. I am happy to have spent a couple of days with Nasso this past week in the beginning of August, around and in my swimming pool, a scenario neither of us could have imagine even two weeks ago. It is a convenient place for him to begin a long process of rehab in tandem with his other physical therapy routines. He is in good spirits but still trying to process all the life changing events that have occurred these past 9 months.The good news about his bone marrow biopsy being negative was a big deal of course. He is still waiting on an additional report regarding the possible presence of an aberrant “t” cell that would make him more vulnerable in the future. Fingers crossed.In any case, Nasso will not be rejoining the work force anytime soon. The neuropathy in his legs, a direct result of the extensive chemotherapy, have disabled him. His once powerful arms and hands will need a lot of time and determination to recover. He has always been a physical guy and is ready and thankful to be able to get after it.Nasso is more than grateful for this Go Fund Me site. Our initial goal has been reached. But the future is still very uncertain for him. Up until now, Rancho Nicasio was able to cover his health insurance. He now has to rely on COBRA, which costs around $800 a month. Disability may help with his other living expenses for a while, but it’s just a situation nobody wants to be in.So I’m going to leave this site up for the immediate future and raise our goal.Your generosity has been exceptional.

She faced  this horrible disease 4 1/2 years ago and beat it, but on March 20th was given the heartbreaking news that it had returned. A lot has changed since Kendall's first battle with cancer. She got married, became a mother to my beautiful granddaughter, Sofia, and has continued her career. Kendall first noticed a lump under her arm about a month ago and immediately contacted her oncologist. He ordered a PET scan to check for any tumors she might have and also ordered a needle extraction biopsy. After the results of both tests were in, it was confirmed that the Hodgkin's Lymphoma was back.  She has a key lime sized tumor in her armpit, an orange sized tumor next to her heart and a small tumor under her collarbone. Kendall had a central line (port) surgically implanted in her chest on March 28th. This is how the chemo will be administered to her during treatment. Kendall will undergo 9 weeks of aggressive outpatient chemo in her hometown of Medford, Oregon starting next week. As soon as the chemo is complete she will undergo another PET scan to confirm that the chemo has killed the tumors. Next, Kendall will be moved to Portland, Oregon to get an even more aggressive chemo that will be given to her over 6 consecutive days. We were told she can expect the side effects from this treatment to be the harshest of anything she has faced to date, and will certainly cause her to lose her hair. Then the final and most brutal treatment will happen immediately after. The final treatment is a full bone marrow transplant that will remove all of Kendall's bone marrow, treat it with medication and her own stem cells and then return it to her body. This treatment will happen over a 4 week period and will put her white blood cell count at zero. Kendall's body will not have the ability to fight off even the weakest germs so this will be a very delicate time for her and our family. Kendall will be isolated from everyone except for her mother and I, who will care for her during the treatment and the 2 week recovery.  This will be a very rough time for her as she won't be able to have any contact with Sofia during this time.The funds we raise for her will be used to cover all of the outrageously expensive medical costs before, during and after her treatment that we already know her insurance won't cover. It will also be used for travel expenses to and from Portland, the 6 week housing for Kendall during the bone marrow transplant and recovery, and help with living expenses while Kendall is unable to work, which may be as long as 6 months. Kendall's husband Fily is working hard as a full time nursing student which makes it impossible for him to work at this time, so Kendall is the sole provider for her new family.For all of you that know me, this is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I am a person that loves to give to others but at the same time find it so hard to ask for help, but this is an urgent situation. So from the bottom of my heart and on behalf of my entire family, I thank you for any support you can give.  Please share this link and continue to pray for my angel, Kendall Joy.",113,366,2,120,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

When my oncologist told us that our best hope is flying to Switzerland for treatment, we decided to say yes without knowing how we would pull it off. It almost reminds me of the “trust fall,” where you fall backwards and believe that someone will be back there to catch you. In this case, our family, friends and a lot of people who we don’t even know not only caught us, but lifted us up more than we can believe. The amount of funds raised in a matter of hours and days was stunning. I never would have believed that we’d have this kind of response, especially after many of you have already given to us in the past. It seems like every day on every television channel and every internet story, we are told how divided we are in this country for a variety of reasons. To me - this has been the ultimate reminder that people really are good. A large community that is united by compassion and kindness has lifted us up when we needed it the most. A community, by the way, made up of people in many states, several countries, men and women, straight and gay, Republicans and Democrats, young and old, etc. It will be impossible for us to ever thank this community of kindness in a way that feels like enough. But from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate what each one of you has done for us. Whether it was a donation, sending us a dinner, saying a prayer, giving a hug on a tough day, or just being a friend, this community has meant everything to us - and I thank you. We will do our very best to pay your kindness forward in as many ways as we can in the future.So here we are - in Switzerland. I will be admitted into the hospital tomorrow morning, and will stay until Thursday. I want this treatment to be successful for the obvious reasons, but I also feel some strange pressure to make all of your support worth it. I know that’s a little crazy, but I don’t want to let everyone down. Once I’m injected with the isotope, I will literally be radioactive. Nobody (including Anne) will be able to be around me for a day and a half. People experience a wide range of side effects, so I’m not sure what to expect. I’m both excited about the treatment and also already nervous about the future results. We will keep you posted on how it goes. Thanks again and I love you all!-ScottUPDATE:**Thanks to your generosity, we were able to meet our initial goal in less than a day!! Since the interest in helping has been so high, we will continue and any additional funds will go towards Scott’s second and third treatments that will come to a total of $36,000.  We are overwhelmed by the response and I know that Scott and Anne are as well. **Our brother Scott continues his courageous battle with cancer.  With his wife Anne and son Alec by his side, he has fought every day.  His best option for treatment at this point takes them to Switzerland.  We are hoping to raise enough to help him pay for his first treatment and anything additional will go toward subsequent treatments (he has to go 3 times).   We want them to be able to focus on getting the best treatment he can and enjoying every day without worrying about medical and traveling costs.  When we approached Scott about additional fundraising, he finally agreed but only if we would add a personal letter to you all.  We have attached the letter below.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  As a family, we appreciate all your support.Renee & MichelleHi Friends and Family,First, we want to thank all of you who have offered to set up a fundraising site for us. We have agreed to let my sisters create one, but felt like we needed to tell everyone why. Since my diagnosis, we have gotten so much support.  People have set up fundraisers for us over the last few years.  There were times when we thought we had been given way too much and would eventually need to donate it to a non-profit.   However, this journey turned out to be more challenging (and more expensive) than we realized.    Our eyes are now wide-open to healthcare in America, and people with rare diseases are really in a tough spot. Luckily, we have you.  Trust me, without you all I might not be here today.  And if I were, we certainly would not still be living in our house or be able to send Alec to daycare.   We cannot thank everyone enough for all of the prayers and support.  We absolutely could not do it without you.   Up until now I have been able to see the best specialists in the country at MD Anderson in Texas and James Cancer Center in Ohio.  I have tried several clinical trials, but the cancer has continued to act very aggressively.   All of the specialists agree that my best chance now is a full body radiation procedure called PRRT.   It is an amazing treatment that can target all of the bone tumors in my body (I have many, many of them now).  It has been approved by the FDA for the more common types of neuroendocrine cancers, but not for mine.  Since insurance does not cover anything not approved by the FDA – we’re out of luck.  Believe it or not, it is less expensive to go to another country and pay out of pocket for the procedure than it is to get it here at the hospital in Pittsburgh without help from insurance.   We have made the decision to go to Basel, Switzerland to get the first round of PRRT.  The first treatment alone will be $12,000 (there are 3 treatments overall, 10 weeks apart), and there will obviously be significant travel expenses.  The cost is high, and it was not an easy decision for me, but I feel like no matter what happens, Alec has to know that I did everything that I possibly could to spend more time with him.  And besides, I haven’t given up yet. And I don’t plan on it.   We want you to know that you have already done your part.   Nobody should feel like they need to contribute again.  We love you all so much for everything that you have already done and nothing will change that.   We agreed to this because many are asking what else they can do, and honestly – we need some help.  Not counting the trip(s) overseas, the costs of endless appointments, prescriptions and travel add up quickly.  It has been very humbling to go from a life where we never had to worry about finances, to a place where we have to admit that we can’t do it on our own.  We can only say that your thoughts, prayers, kindness and support have meant everything to us and we’ll do everything that we can to pay it forward when we are able.

The have 6 amazing kids. Hallie-15 Olivia-14 Luke-11 Lincoln-10 Emma-6 and Bo-3. This is no ordinary family. You can find the Smith’s constantly serving others, always having fun but most of all, they are always together. You will not find better kids or more devoted parents. In the fall of 2017, Jodi was diagnosed with stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. After months of difficult chemotherapy treatments and one major surgery, Jodi received a clean bill of health. A true miracle.About a week after her clean scans, Jodi packed up the kids and headed to Utah for a family-filled summer with the kiddos. Casey stayed home to work with plans to meet up with the family at a later date. A few days into the trip, Jodi received a phone call that Casey had collapsed and had two seizures while helping a friend move. Jodi caught a plane in the middle of the night to be by Casey’s side. Casey was diagnosed with Glioblastoma multiforme. An inoperable tumor in the brain. Casey will receive radiation and chemotherapy as treatment as this tumor does not yet have a cure.To know the Smith family is to love them. The Smith kids are incredible examples, faithful as can be and righteous in all they do. Plus, they are fun-loving, hilarious and love each other deeply. To say they’ve had more than their fair share is an understatement but they persevere and continue to choose the right. It is absolutely amazing how these kids have handled the cards that have been dealt to them with both of their parents being diagnosed with cancer. It’s a true testament of good values and a strong family unit.We’ve set up this account to hopefully provide some relief to their family at this time but also because so many people have asked to help.

He chalked it up to the flu, since it was rampant around town. From the moment he arrived at the ER, his life took a turn that none of us could have ever imagined. Chris didn’t have the flu. Chris was septic. The procedure he had caused a Strep A infection in his blood that traveled throughout his entire body and all of the sudden he was fighting for his life. Chris experienced multiple organ failure, was intubated (on a ventilator), on dialysis and a team of doctors did all they could to save his life. The next few weeks in the Intensive Care Unit proved to be devastating. Chris went thru endless tests with rounds of doctors trying to stabilize his condition. After being intubated for over 2 weeks, doctors chose to perform a tracheotomy so that he could breathe without a tube in his voice box and to reduce the likelihood of infection.Chris had been through the ringer. His body had just barely survived multiple organ and acute heart failure. Then, he couldn’t move his arms or legs. Like many ICU patients who are that close to death, Chris was diagnosed with Critical Illness Neuropathy/Myopathy. This news was beyond anything we were expecting. The Neurologist said that in the 30 years he has been practicing he has never seen such a severe case. He said it may be months or years before Chris will be able to move again, from his neck down. He is not able to breathe on his own, nor able to speak. He is fed through a feeding tube to his stomach.The doctors announced on March 20th that the best course at this time to take would be to transfer Chris to a Long Term Care Facility and out of ICU, where he has now been for the past month. Chris may require professional care for a long time, perhaps the rest of his life.Chris and his wife own a wonderful CPA practice that they acquired after his wife’s step father passed away almost 2 years ago and they were gifted his business. This is their ONLY source of income. They have 2 little girls, ages, 1 ½ and 3 1/2. The financial burden on this family is overwhelming and they will not be able to take on all of the financial responsibilities alone.Our hope and prayer is for Chris to recover and one day regain mobility for independent living. Chris is well known by friends & family for his smile, charm and dedication to wife and children. His family gives heartfelt thanks for the love and kindness they have received to date. Please help support Chris in his time of need! This will help his family with medical expenses and rehabilitation.With love,His Family",295,935,10,300,5 months,18 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

About a month later, Amy began to experience numbness/paralysis on her left side and face.  Amy went through a whirlwind of misdiagnoses and treatments, including MS treatments that led to a severe allergic reaction. Sadly, after biopsy confirmation, she was diagnosed with brain cancer.  In 2013-2014 Amy underwent months of chemotherapy, radiation and then eventually surgery to remove her original brain tumor and miraculously has been cancer free for the past 4 years.  Amy remained paralyzed on her left side from the original tumor but was otherwise able to lead a normal, happy life and mother her children as they have grown.  Sadly, about 9 months ago she started experiencing dizziness and a decline in speech and mobility that has continued to worsen and included a hospital stay in December for pneumonia.  Amy has been unable to speak and walk since August and the burden of care for herself and her four children has been on her family and, in particular, her amazing husband Sean.  We hope to raise funds to help pay for services, medical costs and other unexpected costs.

Flavia Davis, a valued and loved nurse, wife and most importantly mother, has cared for so many adults and children over her extensive career.  Her exemplary work ethics and compassionate care made her instrumental in the initiation of nursing programs in Radiology and at Pediatric MRI and PACU.Then in 2016, Flavia was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.  This devastating news wrenched the hearts of all that know her, but Flavia remained resilient. She underwent several surgeries, radiation and chemotherapy, and suffered some severe complications where most would throw their hands up, but not Flavia.  She got on her road to recovery supported by her husband and young son. She was able to return to work doing what she loves and caring for those in need. After a routine checkup later that year, a small spot was discovered in her left lung and thus began another round of chemo.  Three months of treatment and things were looking hopeful. Even when the chemo was leaving her exhausted she pushed through caring for those at work and home. Then devastating news came end of June this year when she went in for her 3 month checkup. The tumor doubled in size and 5 additional tumors were found in her left lung. The cancer doctor said there is nothing they can do because it is so close to the mediastinum.  Flavia's battle with this very aggressive and rare form of cancer now has  her at risk of losing her medical benefits due to missing work to get the treatment she needs.  We think something can be done.  A prayer, a hope, your support in donating to help this beautiful soul so she can enjoy her husband and son as long as her destiny allows.  Every minute is more precious now, and it’s so sad that it takes news such as this to open your eyes to the wonder of life and the value of time.  So do something.  Let's not stop at words, She wouldn't!!!",209,799,16,203,1 month,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She was admitted to St. Anthony's hospital, in St. Pete, Florida,  on June 7, and has spent the days since surrounded by an incredible group of supportive friends and family who continue to be amazing advocates for her care. Michelle's symptoms began just a few weeks ago, but progressed quickly. After consulting with her primary care physician, she underwent a CT scan hoping it would reveal the cause of her abdominal pain and bloating. The CT scan did show some abnormalities, but additional testing was required which took her to St. Anthony's. We received official word that cancer cells were present in her abdomen on June 12, and surgery was performed the same day to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Doctors were pleased with the outcome of the surgery, and to no one's surprise Michelle was an absolute Rockstar from pre-op, through the entirety of the 4-hour surgery, into post-op and recovery. We look forward to getting her back on her feet as soon as possible so she can take the next step in her treatment plan, which will involve chemotherapy. As we begin to digest this news and plan for Michelle's continued care, we have decided to create a GoFundMe page on her behalf as an outlet for friends near and far to connect and contribute should they feel called to do so. As you can imagine, the emotional shock of a cancer diagnosis and so many uncertainties are only compounded by the financial stress.First and foremost, your love, prayers and emotional support will be the family's lifeline in the months to come. The outpouring of support already has been such a blessing and provided great comfort to Michelle and her family. Michelle's beautiful, kind and caring spirit for others has touched so many people in so many ways over her 56 years on God’s earth.

The following day an echo cardiogram was completed on her heart, which reveled damage to one of the valves showing it was operating at only 20%. This damage was caused by the chemotherapy (known as Cardio Toxicity). The following day during a needle biopsy (Thoracentesis) of the fluid, on March 1st, Julie suffered a stroke.  She was rushed from Spectrum Pennock Hospital in Hastings to Spectrum Butterworth Hospital ER, in Grand Rapids, where we received the sad news that she had suffered severe brain damage in her left brain resulting in right-side paralysis, speech and cognitive issues. Julie spent 16 days in the Critical Care Unit, then transferred to the stroke unit where she spent two additional days, before being transferred to Spectrum Rehab Facility. Julie then began a long, difficult journey of rehab. She has repeatedly revealed her strength and spirit by enduring a ventilator, grueling tests, painful treatments and challenging physical therapy on a daily basis. The past months have been a virtual roller-coaster due to her heart issue, spasticity in her right leg and foot, as well as multiple other complications, setbacks and difficulty finding the proper balance of medications.  Along the way, medical insurance issues have made getting her treatment needs difficult. She has been through approximately 2 weeks of rehabilitation at Spectrum Rehab Facility, then 4 weeks of rehabilitation at Mary Free Bed in Grand Rapids, back home for in-home therapy for a few weeks, then, because of setbacks for various reasons, has been in and out of the hospital, as well as another almost 2 weeks of rehab at Mary Free Bed (not covered by insurance). Chuck has been working tirelessly day and night with God's grace and doing a marvelous job of advocating for her and doing what's best for her; which is what one would want done for themselves if they could not speak the words.  Julie's team of doctors are finding that their options are becoming limited given the condition of her heart and the effects of the stroke.  In the meantime, Julie will be at home trying to get her heart strengthened with medication.  She will need round-the-clock care, as well as daily professional in-home care, which will not be covered by insurance, contributing to the financial strain that has been building over these past months. The costs have been significant and will continue to be.  Those who know Julie know that her big heart has compelled her to always be there for anyone in need and the Lord has blessed so many people through her support and actions.  She has always had a unique ability to know what people need even when they did not know they needed it themselves.  She goes above and beyond to provide whatever is needed.  Be it a helping hand, resources or sometimes just her love and prayers.  At this time of need, here is our opportunity for 'Giving Back to Julie'.  Her family is so grateful for all of the support: thoughts, prayers and expressions of love that she has received.  It is with great faith that we continue on to whatever God has in store. OCTOBER 2014 - BEE BRAVE 5K RUN/WALK",99,453,4,100,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I did not qualify for insurance, nor did I have the financial means to afford private insurance. I had to go to the free clinic, where they referred me to an imaging center. The test results showed a benign cyst. In retrospect, they think the cancer was behind it, not seen on the ultrasound at that time. They told me to come back if it bothered me, otherwise the cyst did not alarm them/seemed normal. In November I started to notice it was larger and actually noticeable through clothing, which bothered me a little. I said I would get it checked out, but holidays happened and life got in the way, and they said it was benign.... Come January 2018 I was snowboarding when I fell and hit my chest pretty hard. Two weeks later it wasn't getting better and seemed swollen, so I went back to the free clinic where they ordered an ultrasound. That came back abnormal. I then had a second ultra sound, blood work, and referral for a mammogram which showed a more serious issue. I then had 4 biopsies, two left breast, 1 lymph node in left armpit and a pretty traumatic one on my right breast. The results are that I have ductal carcinoma in situ. As I waited for the next steps they started doing an MRI, and a petscan, which resulted in showing the cancer has spread to both my lungs and my sternum. Our protocols for women and breast cancer testing is not good enough. It is not  protocol to get a mammogram until 40 years old because programs/insurance won't pay for it without valid reasoning. Mind you because I didn't have insurance, didn't qualify, and am not able to afford private insurance and the clinics are so full and over worked I was forced to wait 5 months to know what was going on. Had regulations and insurance been different I wouldn't be in such a fight right now.""Those are the words of our friend Philecia. Her cancer is stage four and has spread. She is the strongest most vibrant woman we know. We are gearing up to fight this as hard as we can as a team, which is why we need as much help and support from our respective communities as we can get.

Symptoms included debilitating fatigue and body aches, night sweats and insomnia, low blood sugars, nausea and low appetite, tingling, twitching, shooting pains, anxiety and palpitations.In April, after seeing eight doctors and many holistic therapists, she was diagnosed with Lyme Disease. Like many people with Lyme, Kieran was never aware of the tick bite and never had the classic circular rash. Lyme is often missed or misdiagnosed because the symptoms can be vast and can look like many other illnesses. Late-detection can make the disease more difficult to treat and heal. Kieran is now seeing a Lyme-literate nurse practitioner and receiving antibiotic treatment. Her visits, specialized lab tests, and treatment are not covered by insurance. This comes after nine months of illness and distress, which have forced her to give up much of the work she loves — teaching jobs, performances, and more.Kieran and her husband Vincent are both self-employed and an illness like this brings overwhelming financial stress. They have made incredible contributions to our flourishing Boston music/dance/art scene and it is times like THESE when we, as a community, are able to give back and help ease the burden.

As people come up the Rocky steps and enter the Museum, the first smiling face they see is Angel’s. He’s incurably positive and funny, disarming visitors with his warmth and helpful suggestions — just the person you’d want to encounter when entering a foreboding stone edifice. The Museum places Angel at that key spot because he is so accomplished at what he does, and he is highly valued for it. But Angel’s beaming smile hides just how much trauma he’s enduring inside. It turns out his slim build is supporting a Herculean weight, one he often doesn’t want to talk about. Angel and his wife Jacqueline have a beautiful family that includes their son Angel Luis, 33, and daughter Nitza Jeannet, 30. Angel Luis is married and has an 8-year-old son, Angel Luis Jr. Nitza has a 11-year-old daughter, Mia Lovey, as you can see from their family photos.When Angel met Jacqueline, she was a recent widow. Her husband, ironically also named Angel, had died at the age of 33 from a brain tumor. She had two young children, and Angel enveloped his new family with such love, becoming their strength as they started their lives together. Their kids grew up and started families of their own, just as it’s supposed to be. But a few years ago, Nitza began having internal pains, and she didn’t know what was causing them. Then she had a car accident. In the hospital, they did an MRI scan of her internal organs to make sure nothing was damaged. That’s when they discovered she was full of tumors. The next day they performed emergency surgery on her kidneys, which were being damaged by the growths. Since then she’s had a series of additional operations to remove tumors on the back of her eyes, in her head, all over. She now has a tumor that’s developed on her pancreas. She can’t face having another surgery to remove it, so she’s living with the pain for now.Then Angel Luis, Nitza’s brother, also was in a car accident. Like his sister, scans after the accident revealed that he, too, was as full of tumors. The same sequence followed: emergency kidney surgery, operations to remove brain tumors, and so on. Currently, Angel Luis is undergoing daily radiation therapy for some of his tumors, and he dreads going to the hospital each day for it. His doctors just declared him unable to work for the rest of his life.It turns out Angel Luis and Nitza have a genetic disorder, a rare condition called VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau) disease. The tumors are usually benign, but they can turn cancerous and must be removed before they damage healthy tissue. There is no cure yet for this genetic nightmare that’s passed down from generation to generation.Angel Luis Jr. and Mia Lovey have had CAT scans and MRIs. Sadly, they both carry the gene, but VHL doesn’t typically appear until its victims are in their 20’s or 30’s, just as was the case for Angel Luis and Nitza.Jacqueline has been so distraught by what is happening to her family that she’s having difficulty coping and, for the past few months, has not been able to function at her job. Angel drops his son off at the hospital for his radiation treatment every morning on his way to the Museum, and picks him up afterwards. Angel is the only family member who is able to care for the others, and he’s really worried about keeping his job at the Museum with all the responsibilities he has to his family.And the bills keep mounting. Nitza and Mia Lovey live at home with Angel and Jacqueline. Angel Luis, along with his wife and son, still live in their own place, but it’s questionable how long they can continue to do that. Angel Luis hasn’t been able to work since this started, and now he cannot return to his job. Angel is in crisis. His family needs help; yet, he feels reticent to ask. So, we, his friends, are asking for him. Please help Angel take care of his family. Please donate whatever amount you can to help him pay the bills. We can only imagine how the medical expenses are piling up — let alone the cost of supporting his whole family while trying to keep his job at the Museum. If there ever has been a case worthy of our help, this is it.Angel is truly appropriately named; he is a gentle and kind soul who is trying to manage all of this on his own -- without a complaint.  But it’s time for the rest of us to step up and help with their expenses. Please give what you can – right now – they desperately need your help. Please share Angel’s story with everyone you know, and please ask them to give too.

We then learned that one side of her brain developed abnormally and is larger than the other. This abnormality causes intractable epilepsy along with global developmental delay. Bowen is STRONG, fierce and determined. She proved doctor after doctor wrong and met her milestones time after time. She is one of the smartest 3 year olds we know. That being said Hemimegalencephaly is a life long fight. One we are ready to tackle head on. And our path leads us in a different direction for her now. After failing two seizure medicines and having some discouraging test results, doctors at TCH have determined that surgery is the next step for her. In the next few months, she will have what is called a Hemispherectomy . This is one of the most intense surgeries a little girl could go through. They essentially have to disconnect the right side of her brain from the left. She will be in surgery all day and in the hospital for recovery for at least a month afterwards. She is unlikely to regain skills in her left hand (but again our Bowen loves to prove people wrong). She also will take a cut in her vision field which will require intensive therapy to adjust to this new normal.We know now that life from now on will be ""before surgery'' and ''after surgery.'' Just as her seizure changed our paths so will this.We sat down with her school and teachers to tell them the news of the Hemispherectomy and immediately her teacher said ''tomorrow we start teaching her how to use her right hand more.'' They came up with ideas on how to make her feel comfortable at a hospital, how they can work as a team to help her in any way they can, and most importantly that they are a shoulder to lean on from here on out.That is what this Go Fund Me is about. Every cent will go to the STARS/STARS Scholarship Program at the Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center. Bowen will need intensive therapy not only after the surgery but for months and years to come. Every single donation you make will make a difference for not only Bowen but every other child at that school and in this wonderful program. You can see more about STARS here . We had already heard of STARS before she was diagnosed. We immediately fell in love with the program but also decided to tour other special needs schools in the area. We were shocked to find that no one else in Houston has an inclusion program like Bertha Alyce. Preschoolers with disabilities and developmental delays are integrated into a traditional classroom setting where it benefits not only them, but also makes an important impact on their traditional peer groups. What they have here truly is one of a kind and we are extremely lucky.So thank you to each and every one of you who have been there for Bowen and our family. We appreciate you more than you know.

The fact that Morley is only 26 makes his case even more rare as the majority of individuals given this diagnosis are in their 60s and 70s.

Medical,44,All Hands on Deck for Bronwen ,https://www.gofundme.com/allhandsondeckforbronwen,"CAMBRIDGE, MA","April 25, 2018","$50,000","$35,760","Dear Friends, On December 19, 2017, Bronwen Zwicker learned that she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease).  ALS is a disease that affects the nerve cells, or neurons, that control voluntary muscle movement.  Voluntary muscles create movements that include chewing, walking and talking.  The disease disrupts the motor neurons that the brain uses to communicate with the rest of the body, causing them to degenerate and eventually die.  This means that the brain is no longer able to send messages to the muscles.  When the muscles lose function, they become stiff, twitch, weaken, and atrophy. The disease is comprehensive, eventually affecting all voluntary muscles in the body, and inhibiting the affected person's ability to speak, eat, move, and breathe. There is no cure for ALS.  So far, there has been no effective treatment to halt or reverse the progression of the disease.  Three to five years is the amount of time that the majority of people who are diagnosed with ALS have to live.  There are exceptions, with some living ten or more years from when symptoms first appear. ***So far, you have been reading a general overview of ALS.  There are sentences here that skip light years ahead of Bronwen's current everyday experience.  To place commas between words as heavy with meaning as ""speak,"" ""eat,"" ""move,"" and ""breathe,"" as a way of describing all of the vital actions that ALS effectively ends, feels like an insult, a bludgeoning of the nuances that are packed into the very unique experience of being Bronwen Zwicker.  What I am trying to describe is actually impossible to articulate.  I am trying to describe the indescribable.  Bear with me.  I love her, and this hurts.  ***When she was still a child, Bronwen's voice was already so powerful that she was asked to sing lead in a church play.  The congregants who saw her perform thought that she had been hired as a ringer to sing the part.  If you go to the Zwickers' house today and sit on the back porch as the sun is going down, you can still hear that voice, feel it as it reverberates through your entire body and through the lucky air of Richmond, and understand why those congregants thought that they were listening to a trained professional so many years ago.  But singing for Bronwen is more difficult now.  ALS is already affecting the muscles that are required to make those otherworldly sounds.  Something that has always been second nature to Bronwen--such powerful sounds from such a small person!-- has turned into a physical challenge, and it will continue to grow more challenging.  Every day is packed with profound differences from the day before.  There are not enough words to fit on a website that could adequately describe Bronwen Zwicker herself, nor the many changes she has already experienced in the few months since receiving her diagnosis.  What is of utmost importance is to understand that the range of what is needed to facilitate her new everyday--with the realization that this everyday is always changing as the ALS progresses--means that a substantial amount of funding will be needed for Bronwen to be a person living in the United States with ALS.  Given the costs the Zwicker family has already incurred and the unpredictability of the disease itself, there is no entirely accurate way to pinpoint a dollar amount for funds needed.  Safe to say the amount is high, and it will continue to grow higher.  There may be a lot of uncertainty right now, but one thing that is without a doubt is that Bronwen and her family should not have to go broke as a result of ALS.This is where you can help.   Bronwen and her husband, Stephen Martineau, have moved in with Bronwen's parents, Bob and Dianne Zwicker.  They will need to make modifications to their home so that Bronwen can live as comfortably as possible.  Contractors have estimated that the cost for an accessible bathroom alone will be upwards of $30,000.  The modifications are not covered by health insurance. With assistance from friends and family, Bronwen has begun traveling to Baltimore to participate in weekly clinical trials at Johns Hopkins.  Right now she is paying out-of-pocket for travel and overnight lodging.  These costs will continue to add up as she must participate every three weeks in a trial that lasts a total of twenty-four weeks. These are just some of the changes that have happened in four months.  Beyond hospital bills, home modifications, and the costs of traveling for clinical trials, there are myriad expenses that could pile up, but could potentially be covered if enough funds can be raised, including: - technology to help with communication and other activities - a power wheelchair and accessibility ramps - adaptable clothing and footwear - nursing and personal care- complimentary treatments such as massage and acupuncture So let's get this funding going! Spread the word.  Share and re-share.  Any dollar amount will help. Thank you.",248,818,16,271,4 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

One that requires constant around the clock care, numerous medications and expensive co-pays, along with a bumpy road to recovery.Tricia is a self-employed technical writer, whose master of vocabulary, grammar, editing and writing is unparalleled. Yet, today she is having trouble completing a simple text message. She is unable to work and the timetable for her return to writing is completely unknown.Mike has been the voice of Gaylord for more than 21 years, our community’s cheerleader, champion, commentator, and inspirational voice on the Eagle 101.5. He has not been able to work since April 25th, and as Tricia’s sole caregiver his ability to return to work at his regular pace is uncertain. The entire community of Gaylord and surrounding areas have woken daily to his cheerful voice. How many times have we heard Mike help raise money for a local charity, share an inspirational message from a local hero, or have the perfect comment for a tough community moment? Mike is our on-air voice and Tricia is our on-paper gal, and now they are faced with unimaginable bills and medical debt. Coupled with Tricia’s inability to work and significant prescription drug costs weekly, the bills and stressors are mounting.We need to rally to ensure they can remain in our community and in their home. We as a community can work to reduce their financial stresses so that they can focus on Tricia’s recovery and both of their healing from this traumatic event.So, if you know Mike and Tricia Reling, if Tricia ever helped edit your materials, if you have ever heard Mike on the radio, if he ever interviewed you, if you ever laughed at his jokes, if you ever talked baseball with Mike, if you were ever inspired by Mike, his words, or his beams of energy, I humbly ask you to give what you can to support their road to recovery.",316,1.4k,3,309,3 months,23 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

His muscular pain starting to get worse, his body had a difficult time adjusting to dialysis, he suffered from a stroke, and was diagnosed with so many blood clots in his legs he needed surgery.  It was the most painful experience anyone could ever go through and he came very close to losing his left leg from the knee down.  FAST FORWARD TO TODAY.  Gregg needs Oxygen 24/7 to stay alive and the only way to survive or have any type of quality of life is to have a double lung transplant.  None of the Boston hospitals can do the surgery.  UPenn is the only hospital that can do it.  Eventually, he will need to move to Philadelphia because he needs to be within 4 hours of the hospital when he gets the call that they have a set of lungs available for a transplant. Along with the cost of moving to Philly and current medication expenses, the cost of the transplant surgery is 1.6 million dollars.  Most of this is covered by insurance but there will be significant costs he will have to bear.  We are setting up this Go Fund Me Page so friends and family can help raise money to offset some of those significant costs of care for Gregg, and to also to help take care of his family.THANKS FOR READING AND FOR YOUR THOUGHTS, PRAYERS, LOVE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT.",196,482,2,198,1 month,14 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Cancer, to all of us is an ugly word that we sympathize with when we hear it, we cringe when we hear a loved one has it and we mourn if they pass. I have known Nona and Ovi Taut for the better of seven years, we have shared joys, memories, pain and blessings together. Over that time they have become some of my dearest friends and quite quickly family. Nona is my sister in law, my wife’s best friend and even happened to become my neighbor. She grew up a Christian woman, married her first love and endured 13 long years of not being able to have a baby. Five years ago, God answered their prayers and blessed them with a beautiful baby girl, Victoria. But, two years ago…. When life seemed to perfect, beautiful and simple…. Cancer came knocking. Nona is 39 years old, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Adenocarcinoma, better known as stomach cancer that has spread to many other parts of her body. Through her journey she has battled and fought a valiant fight. She has endured Chemo therapy, radiation and even the removal of her stomach, pancreas and other organs. After endless months in the hospital, hundreds of tests, countless sleepless nights and a pain that one can only understand when this storm is truly upon them. Only God knows what his will is and how long our lives last. The challenge that they now face is more daunting than any person can truly imagine. The medical system in this country is so broken that an illness like this not only can take a person’s life, but leave a trail of ruin for all of those behind.

Thank you also for your contributions that will help this be time totally devoted to healing for this beautiful family. Much love and gratitude.Here's Michal's Facebook post:My dear friends and family. I have some news to share. Last week I was diagnosed with a pretty substantial tumor on my vestibular nerve and pressing up against my brain stem.I went in for a basic check up, as I'd been having a sore throat on my right side, kind of on and off, for a month, only at night-- thought I was probably just fighting something, but that it was going on too long and I should address it. My primary doc checked for inflammation-- everything looked fine and so he sent me to a specialist: an ENT (ear nose throat doc), MC Chen. MC was fairly unemotional doc, who just went about checking me in a routine way, then said, ""I'd like to put a scope down your nose with some local anesthetic."" Sure, I said. He found nothing unusual. ""Let's do a CT scan"". ""Could we maybe do an MRI instead - to avoid all the radiation?"", and he responded firmly that a CT was the way to go, to start off and that I should do it as soon as possible. Despite the weeks out appointment prospects, I nudged my way into getting a CT scan that same day (by standing there at the front desk until there was an opening). At 5pm that evening my phone rang. MC Chen with a heavy voice I'll never forget, ""so, I have some news.. I couldn't find anything in your throat, but the radiologist found an 'incidental finding'-- there is a 2x2x2cm lesion in your inner ear and on your cerebellum and brain stem. I think we need to follow this up with an MRI as soon as we can."" Next day, MRI results come back and we are invited back to Chen's for an explanation. Michael and I sit there and see this image of my brain with a large white mass within it. I am shaking as the news comes in, in waves. I have a tumor on my vestibular nerve called a ""Vestibular Schwannoma"". These are usually benign and slow growing, but the trouble with mine is it's location. A terrible place for a person who is smitten with movement and sensation as I happen to be. It surrounds my right vestibular nerve (balance), it is on my facial nerve (facial mobility, facial strength), it's in contact with the trigeminal nerve-- responsible for facial sensation, biting, chewing, taste. It is pressed up against my cerebellum and brain stem (Bracium Pontis-- muscular control, coordination and movement, and against my Lateral Pons= my life. Control of the inhalation changing to the exhalation.I feel the terror spread into every nook and cranny of my body like a slow and tentacled poison originating at my belly, my whole body shaking. uncontrollable shaking. I'm at once visualizing the most miserable physical outcome, and then to the possibility of loosing life and not being there for my Maya, seeing her, her not having a mother, losing her mother so young, Michael and Maya losing a mother. I don't want this. I don't want this! Michael squeezes my hand. I look at his face, he is pale. Eyes on the floor.Cut to next days. HARD days. I can't seem to physically manage or contain the amount of fear that is streaming through. I want a monk to tell me what to do. I'm trying and using all my tools. Breathing, moving, yoga, showering, dancing, melatonin, calling wise elders, Netflix! Michael and I are hugging each other full bodied, like two entangled embryos, telling each other the most tender utterings. He is staying with me through every wave of anguish. Saying the most powerful words of love and commitment and level headedness and steady good old Michael medicine. Michael tells me these things are constant: he and Maya will not leave me.--- Now it's a week later, and we have seen several teams of doctors (at UW and Swedish) and are consulting on what the next steps are. All of them agree that a retrosigmoid craniotomy (eek! That word Craniotomy!) is the way to go, but comes with a whole slew of possible outcomes and side effects that will dramatically shift my quality of life. For sure- my vestibular nerve will be severed to remove the tumor. I will have to relearn balance and proprioception with one remaining verstibular nerve. Dance and yoga will hopefully help me navigate this process in more detail, perhaps more skillfully. Almost certain, I'll be deaf in my right ear. The high chance maybes: I may have partial or complete facial paralysis (facial paralysis! Floppy face! please god no. I say no thank you please no no) for a short or permanent time. Secondly, I'll have major headaches from the actual procedure, and the big ass chunk of my skull they are removing to get in and will replace with titanium, the muscles that will be moved aside, touched and manipulated, etc. The small chance: bleeding, stroke, meningitis, death.I am not a good candidate for Gama Knife radiation therapy, apparently, as with this procedure, the tumor can swell up to up to 50% larger, and with it's proximity to my brain stem, this is a no-go. It also takes away my chances to have surgery in the future if the tumor regrows, as it makes the surrounding (very important) tissues sticky, cooked, scarred and unworkable.--- So now 9 days out after receiving the news. I am doing ok. I'm actually pretty good, steady, almost content. I am trying to keep the flow of normality. I am filling my life, my time, (as usual) with a LARGE amounts of movement: (""Michael, my love-- do you mind if we ride our bike to every possible activity and errand we have despite the weather, our fatigue and the darkness?"") And beautiful precious friend people who shepherd me so gorgeously into an equanimous state, and dancing and smooshing my face into Maya's pot belly. By the way, muy importante is MAYA KNOWS NOTHING. and it shall be kept that way. She thinks we're going to yoga class when we drop her off for 5 hours at a friend's house. Please hold this in the highest importance. I want her world to remain unchanged and sunshine until she needs to deal with whatever comes.I'll attempt to keep you all posted about the next steps.

Neetu was in critical condition and we needed to rush to the hospital immediately. As she was walking to work in downtown Philadelphia, she felt a shortness of breath in her chest. “It’s just my asthma,” she thought, and tried to push through, walking and losing more of her balance with each step.A good samaritan, who was driving on their way to work, saw Neetu faint and immediately stopped their car to help and call 911. The ambulance arrived right after she collapsed, and while being lifted into the ambulance, Neetu called a friend. She was crying. She was alone. She was terrified. She told her friend that she was going to a hospital, and when she realized she did not know where she would be headed to, she cried on the phone to her friend. Suddenly, everything went dark.She went into cardiac arrest. Her heart stopped beating;  blood stopped flowing; and her body shut down. It's nothing short of a miracle that she was in the ambulance, as CPR was administered immediately, which temporarily kept her blood flowing. If Neetu was not in an ambulance, she would not be here today.In the ER, doctors were able to bring our angel back to us with the aid of many machines and medications. She was immediately intubated and placed on a ventilator to help her breath. Additionally, she was placed on a machine to provide her body with oxygenated blood. Once her family arrived to the ER, Neetu was being transferred to the cardiac ICU. Hours later, they were able to find the cause of her cardiac arrest.Neetu had two major blood clots in her lungs. These clots put so much pressure that her heart stopped. From what doctors have told the family, only 4%-6% of patients survive a blood clot of this size in their lungs.Currently, Neetu is still intubated within the cardiac ICU and under the care of an amazing team for whom we are forever indebted to. Neetu just recently celebrated her 30th birthday on March 9. She was also in the midst of planning her wedding which is set for July 2018. She met the love of her life, Devin Luqman, while in law school. They have been together for 7 years and were happily planning for the next step of their lives together.We need your help.

Microtia occurs about 1 in 5,000 births, though rates can vary depending on ethnic background.  In 90% of cases, it affects only one ear, usually the right ear, and is more common in males. "" Sited (Stanford Children's Health)Jillian however, was born with Microtia on both ears and will need three reconstructive surgeries this year.  The surgeon will suture pieces of cartilage harvested from Jillian's ribs to create the framework for the new ears and cover them with the patient's normal tissue. Recovery involves short term hospital stays and long term recuperation at home.While Jillian is able to hear, there are times where this condition hinders her hearing abilities and overall quality of life.  Safety is a major concern because when Jillian wears a helmet for sports and bike-riding, she cannot hear clearly.  During Winter time, when Jillian wears a hat, she has difficulty hearing everyday sounds such as traffic and voices like the crossing guard, teacher, friends in the playground, etc.  As Jillian gets older, this condition is beginning to affect her self confidence at school as well as in extra-curricular activities.  Already a timid child, she has become negatively impacted by situations where other children call attention to her ear deformity. Upon attending a Microtia conference in NYC, Jillian's parents selected a surgeon based out of California who specialized in only Microtia surgeries.  To their dismay, this surgeon retired three years ago due to medical reasons.  He recommended Jillian's current surgeon based out of NYC.  Although Jillian's parents have been saving for the surgeries since Jillian was born, the current surgeon does not accept any medical insurance.  With the medical fees for the doctor alone well exceeding the goal amount, I'd like to help them make up the difference.   As a dear friend of the family, I have witnessed the emotional toll that this situation has taken on them. While there is little that I can do to help minimize their worries emotionally,  I would love to help alleviate the financial burden that these surgeries impose.Any donation, big or small, will make a huge difference to Jillian's future.",107,510,4,101,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

We are friends and neighbors of the Cronck family who wanted to provide an avenue for those wishing to help them through their daughter’s latest medical crisis. It has been heartbreaking to stand by and helplessly watch the up and down roller coaster as their family has seen 5 year old Shiloh struggle through one mystery illness, endure spinal surgery to resolve it and then seem to be on the road to recovery only to end up back in the hospital in even worse circumstances. We’ve watched their lives come to a halt as they juggle caring for their other three children and straddle life between their home in Bellingham and Seattle Children’s Hospital. We’ve watched and wondered how we can support their family. We know they have asked for, and continue to ask, for positive thoughts and prayers. At this time, we’d like to offer additional support as well. There is no firm estimate as to how long they will be in the hospital. Nothing is guaranteed right now. We ask other friends, neighbors and supporters to help us raise money for whatever they need in the coming weeks and/or months. Whether it be medical bills, lodging and transportation, food, or life essentials - they can use our support. I urge you to consider a gift to this beautiful, active, sweet family. Your prayers and thoughts are welcomed as well. Thank you for taking the time to read this. We are grateful for any and all support. If you are not familiar with this situation, let us share Sommer’s words from her public Facebook page. “Shiloh is five years old and the youngest of four. In April, she got very sick and after many hospital visits it was discovered that she had an epidural infection (MSSA) and had emergency spinal surgery across five vertebrae to clear the infection. That was April 10 and she was healing beautifully and on a regimen of antibiotics to thoroughly rid of the infection. On May 9 we returned to the ER as she had high fevers, headache, sore throat, vomiting, and some alarming blood work that was part of her surgery follow up. As we were in the ER she started saying she couldn’t breathe. It is not why we brought her in but it rapidly deteriorated to the point that she was transferred to the ICU on May 10 and is now on a ventilator. The scariest part is that they simply have no idea what is causing it. She has has blood draws, MRIs, X-rays, CT scans, ultrasounds, a spinal tap, nose and throat swabs and still no answers. They do not believe it is related to the previous epidural abscess but are dumbfounded she could have two bouts of horrible bad luck in such quit succession. Her lungs have deteriorated and have fluid in and around them. They show signs of damage. We have no idea why. If they could only figure out what is causing this, perhaps they could help her. All we want are answers and to be on the path to taking our baby home. She has all the best teams working for her, and I am keeping the faith that they WILL figure this out. But my heart needs it to be soon. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers. If you know her brothers or sister, please do not go into great detail with them. With so little information at this time we have chosen to limit what they know about the situation. Thank you.”Update: Shiloh's mother and father have created a Facebook page so we can follow the latest news about how Shiloh is doing.

Medical,45,Support Carey's Fight,https://www.gofundme.com/pymcy4-carey,"CARDIFF BY THE SEA, CA","April 15, 2018","$100,000","$35,100","For those of you that don’t know Carey, she is the middle sister of 3 girls whose mother passed away of cancer way too young. After being diagnosed herself at 31 shortly after marrying Jon, the love of her life, Carey beat the odds. With dreams of babies, Carey and Jon moved to Hawiian paradise but struggled with fertility treatments for years until they miraculously conceived naturally not once, but twice in 13 months! With a 1 year old and 3 month old, Carey was recently diagnosed again with Stage IV metastatic breast cancer that has begun to spread. Unfortunately, some of the cancer is showing growth during chemo this time so they are exploring the best alternative solution.  They are hoping to move their family of 4 to a treatment facility in Arizona which comes with a financial burden with treatment, moving costs, housing, childcare, etc. More details on Carey’s journey is below from Stacey. Please help us pray for the Moyers!  PLEASE ALSO HELP BY KEEPING THIS FUND A SURPRISE FOR CAREY AND HER FAMILY!￼My sister Carey is one of the most intelligent, selfless, beautiful & funniest people you will ever meet.  She’s adopted more rescue animals than I can count, spent years as a Disneyland princess and can make me laugh harder than anyone I know.When Carey was first diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer at the age of 31, we were all shocked and terrified.  Over the next two years, Carey went through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation, as well as a double mastectomy.  Although it was no easy task, she is a fighter and two years later, I can still remember the moment she was officially declared cancer free. Unfortunately, Carey is up against the same battle once again.  This time she is fighting for even more - her two little baby boys, Jake & Drew. ￼When my friends first asked me if we could set up a Go Fund Me to help with Carey’s expenses, my answer was absolutely NOT! Over time though, I have realized this is a necessity. We have to get Carey well for her boys and give her the opportunity financially to explore every treatment option there is.  Also, I began thinking - how amazing would it be to SURPRISE Carey and Jon and show them how everyone they love came together to help their family.  Everyone asks us - how can I help? And I think this is it.   It would mean so much to us for you to share and spread Carey’s story and give her boys the best chance at growing up with their mom.  Side Note – Bill (my Dad) & Carey do NOT know we have set this up, please help make sure they don’t find out, so we can surprise Carey (plus Bill lives by its better to give than receive, almost to a fault!) ￼￼Carey had just married Jon when she was first diagnosed in 2009 and since they hoped to have children of their own, she went through the process of freezing her eggs before starting chemotherapy.  A few years ago, they experienced an unfortunate (and rare!) setback when they began the IVF process and none of the frozen pre-chemo embryos survived.  Looking for an alternative, Carey asked me to be an egg donor.  Inside I was nervous, but quickly said yes after seeing everything Carey had gone through.  We both went through the egg retrieval process, but her doctor was weary of her outcome because of all her body had endured.   When Carey was ready for the embryo implantation, she found out she was pregnant, NATURALLY!  Her doctors had given her less than a 1% chance to get pregnant on her own. This little baby, Jake, would be known as the “miracle baby” in our family.  When Jake was just four months old, Carey found out she was pregnant again with Jake’s little brother!! When Carey’s second baby, Drew, was only a few months old, she started experiencing extreme back pain. She hoped it was just from carrying around her two babies all day. When the pain persisted, she knew she needed to see the doctor and asked her oncologist for a scan.  The day after the scan, her home phone rang.  She was busy holding Drew and immediately began shaking when she heard the message. The doctor stated she needed her to call her back immediately. Carey had that gut feeling this was not good.  And late last year, a bone, CT and PET scan confirmed the worst.    The cancer was back and it was everywhere. My whole family and I were devastated to hear the news.  My initial reaction was that she isn’t going to make it.  How could this happen to her again?  And to our family?  Carey has been through so much and now has a husband and two small baby boys that need her.   Despite my worst fears, when you talk to Carey, you can’t help but to be positive.  True to her personality, she has the best attitude from the day she found out she said, “I’m going to fight this as hard as I can.”   God has given her so much strength!Since the beginning of this year, Carey has been battling.  They moved their family from Hawaii back to Irvine, she’s been on chemo, she’s adopted a raw vegan diet and is doing everything in her power to fight this.We just received her first set of scans since starting treatment and unfortunately it wasn’t the good news we were hoping for.  While her bones do show some healing, the tumors in her liver and lungs have shown growth.  Our options are running out.  Last week, we road tripped to Arizona to explore another path with a clinic that has a 90% success rate in healing her type of cancer.  After speaking with her doctors, we feel this is the best next step for Carey’s treatment.   The plan is for Carey and her family to relocate to Arizona in the coming week so she can seek immediate treatment with this clinic.  Her treatment in Arizona is set to begin early next month. I want to thank everyone in advanced.  We have had so many people praying for Carey and showing so much love and support thus far.  We desperately need to get Carey back to 100% healthy so she can enjoy life with her husband, raising her two baby boys.  My sisters and I lost our mom at such a young age and our biggest fear is for the same to happen to Jake and Drew. Please remember – this is a SURPRISE for Carey & Jon, so SHHHHHHH!!   Be extra careful sharing it on social media (block her from your posts).  I can’t wait to share with Carey how much we raised and ease some of their financial concerns about the next steps in treatment.   Next month, I plan to videotape the reveal and will share it with everyone.  Thank you for your prayers, donations and support.  I will keep you updated on progress. XO Stacey (Carey’s little sister)￼This fund was started by Sarah Cook and Lindsay Hornbeak with input from Carey's sisters, Stacey and Bobbi.  All funds will go directly to Carey and her family after the reveal.",260,253,9,265,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

It's been a very rough patch since that point. January, 2018, SF home after hospital stay in ICU.Despite many setbacks, he has pushed hard to fight his health troubles and again live life as he imagined it.

Medical,46,TYLER TRAN CANCER WARRIOR!,https://www.gofundme.com/m78sk-help-tyler,"ELK GROVE, CA","July 25, 2018","$35,000","$35,027","￼￼Strength is defined as the quality of being strong; to measure the capacity for exertion. In my eyes, my nephew Tyler Tran is the definition of strength. Tyler is a vibrant 17 year old, who is wise and compassionate beyond his years. He’s the older brother to his sister, Haley and as she puts it, “He is the coolest brother and my number one fan.”. I simply can't find a more loving sibling relationship. Tyler loves music especially listening to Imagine Dragons, Maroon 5 and Bruno Mars. Tyler loves basketball, especially the Houston Rockets and especially number 13, James Harden. He loves to indulge in his favorite foods of steak , burgers and my homemade mac & cheese with tater-tots. And as a true kung fu warrior at heart, he would love to meet his idol, Jackie Chan one day. His dream was to attend and graduate from Stanford University. I’ve never smiled more than when I’m in his presence and this kid is such a jokester. Either cracking jokes or enjoying a good laugh, he brings forth the best in everyone he meets and the love for his friends and family is immeasurable.  Unfortunately, Tyler has been battling cancer for almost a year now. In August 2017, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant brain tumor. Even though the road to recovery was treacherous and rough, Tyler was a champion throughout the rehabilitation phase. Though short-term memory loss, double vision and cognitive thinking compromised, he also underwent Chemotherapy and Radiation treatment afterwards. In May 2018, his MRI looked clear and the whole family was able to take a deep breath of relief. Just when we thought the fight was over, Tyler was rushed to the ER last week to find another tumor growing in his head. This time the germinoma tumor was super aggressive and had gone from microscopic to golf size within 6 weeks. Luckily his team at Sutter Children's center in Sacramento quickly scheduled him for surgery and was able to remove to mass. Tyler woke the next morning bouncing back with energy and strength no one predicted would happen. His optimism glowed, however the good news of the removal quickly turned bad. After several tests, the oncology team determined this was extremely rare and highly malignant aggressive yolk-sac tumor had becoming resistant to the chemo and radiation treatments he received in the past. Since there isn't a standard therapy for this rare tumor, the next plan of attack is to begin very strong regimented chemotherapy of Bleomycin and Cisplatin. At this point, Tyler’s determination in his fight has given us strength to support him through kicking cancer's butt, however I know we can do more. We are looking at other possible treatments for this rare and aggressive tumor.  He is being transferred to Stanford Hospital to further his treatments and hopefully shed some light on this terrible disease and if not a cure, then give us more time with this amazing kid. I can’t imagine the heartache of seeing your own child suffer through the pain of battling for his life, but to be left with the financial burden on top of that stress is gut wrenching. Momma Ching and Aunty Youk(Kelly) have been diligently caring for Tyler during his fight at Stanford. These amazing sisters have endured emotional and physical hardship more than anyone should for any child.  I’m reaching out on this family’s behalf to ask for your assistance. Whether it be a medical referral, spiritual or financial, your support would mean the world to Tyler and his family.On a personal note, I’ve been with Tyler since the day of his birth. Tyler is admired tremendously by his friends and family for his bravery, amazing strength, integrity and ambitious tenacity for life. To ask the questions as to why he was chosen to fight this battle is beyond any universal algorithm or even our faith can answer. The thoughtfulness and generosity of Tyler's heart is what amazes me. Even through his suffering, he continues to amaze me and reassures us that ""Everything will be fine, it's OK, I'm OK."" and as a mother, my heart is broken and devastated because I know the suffering my nephew has gone through and how bleak his future may be if we don't act fast. That’s why I want to raise awareness and hopefully find better treatments for aggressive brain cancers like this yolk sac germinoma tumor so that Tyler will have the best chances of being a hero to his sister, my son and pretty much everyone he meets.  As his biggest support system, we’ve decided to keep Tyler and Haley’s morale strong and optimistic with positive affirmations and a painted smile on our faces in hopes that he survives this battle with cancer. He has 1 in 100 chances. Please continue to paint this picture for Tyler and Haley, because at the end of the day, our only gift to them is hope. Thank you for listening and many blessings to you. #fuckcancer #cancersucks #tylerswarriors #tylercancerwarrior #kickcancersbutt #germinomatumor #yolksactumor #braincancer #kidswithcancer",239,663,12,240,1 month,13 days ago,13 days,2018-09-03

Jimmy and I met with two different neurosurgeons at different hospitals yesterday and we have decided to have his care at UW Hospital. Jimmy will be having a cranioscopy surgery on Wednesday, August 1st to remove as much of the tumor as possible. We feel confident in his care team and this decision we made together.This has come as a tremendous shock to our lives starting less than a week ago. The symptoms Jim exhibited came on fast over the past couple of weeks and we acted upon them quickly. Our wedding  is 10 days away, Sam is leaving for college in two weeks and Jimmy was about to start a new teaching job he was thrilled to begin. Life can sometimes be so fragile, changing in an instant. We have seen numerous doctors and continue to research and inquire about all possible avenues we can take to prolong his health and quality of life. After surgery Jimmy will be having both radiation and chemotherapy to fight remaining cancer cells. There will be many appointments, blood draws, and six weeks of radiation daily starting mid-September to name a few of our new life events. Your kind wishes of support and hope through email and text will make a huge difference for Jim and the rest of us. We look forward to visitors in the future as they will be a great distraction from the startling change in our lives. Updates will come as often as we can, but please understand that we’ll need to make our orbit much smaller for a little while so I can continue the important care Jim so deeply deserves and the love and attention our kids need. Thank you in advance for understanding we may not be able to respond to all phone calls, texts and emails and want you to know how grateful we are to ALL of you for keeping us in your thoughts. It has already buoyed us through the first rough days.We have started this GoFund Me account because Jimmy will not be able to start off his school year and may not be able to return to work or anytime soon. Since he’s starting in a new school district, it makes everything a little more difficult. We’ll be working hard to make sure his medical coverage can’t lapse between jobs, and we will be paying for his medical plan in full after his weeks of sick leave run out instead of it being covered by the school district. I plan to take time off of work as well to care for Jim as he will need daily attention. Bringing him to appointments, blood draws, radiation and advocating for him will be costly and taxing but I am beyond honored to be his best partner and advocate. Jimmy and I will need time together as well to take care of our children and connect with his family. We are turning to you, our loving community of family and friends to ask for your consideration in donating to our fund in caring for Jimmy. Every single donation is a blessing that will help put the focus on spending quality time with our kids and extended families instead of worrying about bills and payments. We will also welcome and need help along the way for those willing to assist, whether it is attending an appointment with Jimmy or making us a simple meal. We’ll leave you with knowing that even in these days of deep sadness, we have felt immense joy, just as we have over the past three years of our relationship. We are so thankful for what we have! We’ve laughed, spent precious time with our kids, retold favorite stories and dreamed. We have remained honest and understanding and look forward to each new day ahead of us, even though the path really has taken us somewhere unknown.

For those of you that don’t know Chris, he and his wife Crystal are the loving, devoted parents to their three beautiful children- Declan, 15, Brady, 13 and Molly, 2. They are an amazing family with an unwavering faith in God, and are together facing a challenge that requires all our love and help...Chris's only desire is to get medical treatment and return to his ""normal"" life.  This is a simple yet complicated desire.  One that is going to require time, faith and (unfortunately) money.  Chris and Crystal ask for nothing and almost always decline assistance.  This is why we are reaching out on their behalf.(Please know that this is the abridged version of his painful journey since December.  Please reach out with any questions.)Chris has been ill since mid-December and until recently, the doctors had been unable to determine what has caused his issues.  Since December, Chris has been in intense pain, and on bed rest.  Fortunately, Chris has been seen by highly qualified specialists.  However, he has also had to endure numerous tests and hospital stays because of the sheer complexity of his medical situation.  Initial CT Scans indicated that his adrenal glands had been bleeding and had increased in size (presently to the size of soccer balls).  He is taking medication to replace the 2 hormones that his body is no longer producing.   Through all of the testing he has endured, it was found that he has tumors in both of the adrenal glands and that he has ‘dark patches’ at the bottom of both lungs.  From these findings, further testing was required.In March, Chris got the difficult news that he indeed has Stage 4 cancer in his lungs, lymph nodes, and adrenal glands. The cancer diagnosis has been difficult on many levels for the family, especially having lost Chris’ dad in February 2016 to the same disease. What we had hoped would be some minimally-invasive surgeries has now turned into something more complicated, difficult, and expensive.While the full plan and schedule of Chris’ treatment is still developing, we do know that he will be starting his treatments the week of April 2nd.  Chris is a good candidate for immunotherapy as well, and we will find that out in the coming weeks.  Currently, they are waiting for more results from two more tests from the biopsy to find out definitively.  Immunotherapy is similar to chemotherapy in procedure, it is just a different drug.  In the meantime, we are humbly asking for your financial support as Chris and his family navigate the costly world of healthcare. These funds will be used to offset medical expenses, assist with keeping a normal daily life for the kids, and help with the costs of traveling 4 hours round-trip to Johns Hopkins on a regular basis.  As you are reading and considering lending your support to Chris and his family, I ask that you bear in mind this difficult road he is on and will be facing.  He has not worked since his pain began in December.  He has had the support of his union, but as you can well imagine, it is not enough.There are many stressors that we cannot take away from Chris & Crystal at this time, but we can impact the financial burden they’re facing.We appreciate you even visiting this page and reading our story. Chris is a wonderful man who is loved by so many far and wide. Please help us in making his life a little bit easier during this time. Thank you.",282,1.3k,3,279,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,46,Guy Riccardi Heart & Kidney Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/GuyRiccardi,"SCARSDALE, NY","June 2, 2018","$40,000","$34,719","Family & Friends, We’ve struggled as a family to find the words and strength to explain what has been going on with our fathers health over the past two months. We were given advice from our transplant social worker to start a gofundme ASAP, because many families waiting for a transplant simply cannot afford it.  Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to ask people for help in these situations.  We ask our loved ones to please consider donating to help us cover some of the costs that involve a heart pump, heart & kidney transplant, medicine & hospital stay. Insurance will cover a lot of these costs, but not all. We are trying to fundraise this amount to help us pay these bills. Our journey started on Sunday, April 8th.  Guy was rushed to the hospital where he went into cardiac arrest.  He was put in Lawrence Hospitals ICU unit in very critical condition where he began the fight for a second chance in life. The first 24 hours were the toughest.  Even when the doctors told us there was no hope, he beat the odds with a heart only functioning 25% and kidney at 13%.  After 3 days of being in very critical condition, he started to make progress and we believed he was ""out of the woods"".  We prayed and thanked God for his second chance in life.Sunday, April 15th, we celebrated Kathy & Guys 40th Wedding Anniversary together in the ICU Unit.  It was a day of laughter, tears, gratefulness and pure love.  We knew we were blessed to get through the past week together as a family. Our celebration was short lived, hours later Guy went into cardiac arrest for a second time.  After a day and a half of getting him stable enough, we transferred him to Columbia Presbyterian Hospitals CCU Unit.Every day Guy woke up, he decided it was another day to continue to fight and turn his life around.  The universe tried to take him from us twice and this was a blessing from God that it was not time for him to leave us. Unfortunately, he is very sick.  After many tests and conversations with the doctors, they have determined he will need a heart and kidney transplant.  Even with all of this difficult news, Guy is optimistic and hopeful to make a difference in this world.  As a family, we are also determine to help him make that difference.Currently in Columbias CICU unit, he is on dialysis and a lot of medication to help his heart pump.  On June 1st, he had surgery to have an LVAD pump put in as a ‘bridge to transplant’.  This will help keep his heart keep going until a donor becomes available. ( https://www.mylvad.com/content/what-lvad-how-does-it-work) If you know Guy, you know that he truly has the biggest heart in the world.  He takes care of everyone else before he even considers taking care of himself.  One of his favorite things to do is give out nicknames - he has given every nurse and doctor one already!  As the nurses wheeled him into surgery on June 1st, they gave him a standing ovation. This gofundme is to help us cover the costs of the LVAD pump surgery, heart/kidney transplant surgery, and a lifetime of medication.Lets help give the man with the biggest heart get a new healthy one. Thank you all so much!Love, The Riccardi Family Please repost and share with the hashtag #WeHeartOurGuy",313,868,7,318,3 months,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Although he didn't show any sign of sickness, they took the doctors advice and put him on an antibiotic to help the mass shrink. Unfortunately, the mass only grew, and rather quickly. Christine and George proceeded to take Sean to visit the radiologist for imaging, along with blood work.  The imaging showed the mass was blood fed. This news was terrifying to Sean's parents, as most cancer cells are blood-fed.  The pediatric surgeon immediately scheduled Sean for surgery to biopsy part of the mass to send off to pathology and within a few days, they received a call with the results. The mass was a tumor. Cancer. A highly aggressive form of soft tissue cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma.  A rare cancer. Christine said, ""My heart sank- I panicked. I had no words... ""  Sean was immediately admitted to the hospital. The doctors performed a variety of tests- sending him in and out of anesthesia at least a handful of times- all weekend long. The doctors staged Sean’s cancer as a stage three. The location of the tumor was deemed inoperable due to its location- too close to his spine, facial nerves and major arteries.  After a week in the hospital, Sean was discharged on his 4th birthday.  Due to this rare case, the doctors felt it was necessary to transfer Sean's case to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, a 4 hour round-trip drive, once a week.    An intense treatment plan of chemo and radiation for the next 10-12 months is the long road ahead.  Christine and George are extremely faithful and know Sean can beat this battle, ""Little Sean will fight the heck out of this and kick it in the butt. We have no doubt. There is NO other way!!""Every penny of your generous donation will help offset all of the costs associated with Sean's treatment.We thank you all so much for your love and support in helping out sweet Sean and his family!!

He was just shy of 7 months old when his parents got word from the doctors that no parent should ever have to hear, “Your baby has cancer”. To say the last 1,095 days have been incredibly challenging would be a major understatement.The chemotherapy would start immediately for Johnny in order to shrink the adrenal gland tumor to a size that was safe to operate. On January 7th, 2016 little Johnny was on the operating table for almost 17 hours at Boston Children’s Hospital while the surgeon removed as much of his disease as safely possible from his tiny torso. Once he recovered from surgery, they would hit him with many more rounds of chemo, 39 rounds so far to date. He has had stem cell transplants, advanced MIBG treatments, 20 plus rounds of radiation to his chest and face. Over 150 blood and platelet transfusions. He has had a medical port in his chest every day for 3 straight years, many of them getting removed and replaced due to infections. He has been under anesthesia more than 90 times at 3 years old. His vision and hearing have both been affected, he will never be able to have children of his own. He is not talking yet, only humming and babbling. He has only had hair for about 4 months of his entire life. All of these things are a direct result of dealing with this disease. Johnny has been robbed of just about everything imaginable, yet every day he wakes up smiling and ready to fight another day. His strength and courage could literally move mountains. He is the most inspirational person I’ve ever come across.His mother Colleen who also is his best friend and lifeline has never left his side for a second. After spending hundreds of days in Children’s hospital with her baby, her new reality is anywhere from 30-50 hours per week at Dana Farber’s Jimmy Fund Clinic where Johnny is treated. Johnny’s type of childhood cancer is a very intense one that demands a lot of attention. Colleen was a successful Executive Assistant for over 20 years while always bartending at night as well. Since September 15, 2015, she has no longer been able to work due to the constant care Johnny needs every day. The financial burden that this cancer has put on the Morris family has been tremendous.There were times over the last 3 years that the outlook was not too positive. But there is a new hope! With Johnny fighting so hard each day, he has finally made enough progress to go to Helen Devos Children’s Hospital in Grand Rapids Michigan and receive what his family believes to be life-saving medicine. He’s been accepted into a DFMO program with medicine designed to keep cancer cells out of the body. Even with this amazing news, the family’s been waiting over 2.5 years to hear, it comes with the challenge of traveling halfway across the county multiple times. This will be extremely difficult for the Morris family, not only physically and emotionally, but also financially. The Morris family has exhausted all of their financial resources during this non stop fight. With this new opportunity, they’re very hopefully that Johnny will be able to live a long healthy life.Please consider helping out the Morris family as Johnny’s fight is far from over.

Carrie has moved to Philadelphia, a requirement to be close to the transplant center where the University of Pennsylvania Hospital medical team has performed the most dual organ heart-liver transplants for congenital heart patients. She has just been placed on the transplant list. There is literally no way to predict when she will receive the donation, in 2 weeks, 2 months or 6 months.  With the uncertainty, Carol is remaining in Denver until the call comes from Philadelphia.  The potential of having only 6-8 hours from notification until the transplant surgery means that a commercial flight does not get her there in time, a private jet On-Demand flight does. Carol has never missed a surgery or procedure.  She has been there for every one of them holding Carrie’s hand, squeezing hard when the anesthesia goes into the IV and kissing her forehead as she’s being wheeled into the operating room.  This one will be the most important of all.  After the surgery, Carrie will be sedated for several days and Carol will be at her bedside, focusing on Carrie’s healing.What you probably don’t know is that Carol has been going through treatment for breast cancer for the last year.  She has endured surgery, 20 weeks of chemotherapy and 33 radiation treatments. Endured it all – pain, fatigue, nausea, worry, the days where she said “I just want my life back”.  The process is just finished and she’s recovering with a few more medical procedures to navigate.  With all of that, last year she was not able to work very much.  The few wonderful coaching clients she had and couple of great workshops was all she able to conduct did not come anywhere close to her normal income, depleting her financial resources, a worry unto itself when you’re trying to recover.Our goal is to raise $35,000 to provide support for the On-Demand flight and living expenses in Philadelphia for at least 2 months of hospitalization, no small amount.      We would be very grateful if you could support her by making a donation to her GoFundMe page and then sharing it with your social network.  Please know that even a small amount helps her get closer to her goal, and closer to being with Carrie before her surgery.",107,111,3,111,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,47,Saving Alex - Stage 4 Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/saving-alex-stage-4-cancer,"ORLANDO, FL","March 29, 2018","$45,000","$34,405","I met my beautiful wife Alexandra, and her wonderful kids Andy and Sandy three years ago. From the moment I met her, I knew that she was a very special person. Her sincere caring  and attention for others were evident. She touched my heart like I have never experienced before.  We met, We clicked, We knew it!  We got married a year later.Alex was first diagnosed with stage II Breast Cancer in 2010. She underwent a bi-lateral mastectomy and strong chemotherapy treatment.  At that time we were told by multiple doctors that us conceiving babies was an impossibility due to her previous cancer treatments. The doctors asked if we believe in miracles because it was medically impossible for her to conceive. With  prayers and faith, we were blessed a month after our wedding with the news that she was pregnant.Not only was there one miracle...we were having twins!  Our family now consists of my wife, Alexandra, Son Andy, Daughter Sandy and our little one-year-old twin girls, Ava and Gia.Although my wife had a bi-lateral mastectomy, her body had naturally reacted to the pregnancy of our babies as we quickly found out that some breast mass was left behind during the surgery. Knowing that this had changed the makeup of her body,  we requested for a scan to be done. The doctor felt that an ultrasound of her chest was enough. The test was done and came back clear.However, as the months passed by, Alex kept having pains in her left leg and hip area, which went from being mild to excruciating. Alex is very strong, positive and always keeps a smile on her face,  so cancer returning didn't seem a possibility even to her doctors. After several visits to doctors, we finally got a doctor to order an XRay.  The findings triggered a STAT MRI Scan the very next day.  The scan revealed a lesion on her left hip. A biopsy confirmed that the breast cancer has metastasized to the bone. She is now diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer of the bone. The cancer is triple positive, which is very aggressive in nature and growing rapidly. In a few months, the cancer mass has taken the place  of her bone causing Alex to lose most of the bone on her left hip. Unfortunately, a surgery to remove the mass or reconstruct her hip is not possible due to the amount of bone loss she has suffered. Alex is now bound to the use of a walker and wheelchair, and unable to pick up the babies due to severe pain, the the fragility of her bones and risk of bone fracture. With surgery not being a possibility, the team of doctors has recommended for my wife to go through immediate radiation in hopes to stop or slow down the growth of the cancer cells. Although no further masses have been detected, based on the pathology results, the doctors believe that cancer cells may be in other places as well, just not big enough to be detected at this time. Other than her current radiation therapies, their plan is to have her on chemo pills, shots and intravenous treatments to lower her hormones for the next year or until these medications stop working. Once the pills, shots, and IVs stop working, they would administer chemotherapy treatment for the rest of her time. The doctor is not comfortable with starting her on chemotherapy treatment now due to how much it affected her during her primary cancer treatment. Alex had to be rushed to the hospital and hospitalized with every chemotherapy treatment due to massive drops of her blood cells.The treatment plan and life expectancy we have received are very discouraging. Having our kids and little babies does not allow us to simply wait until the treatments no longer works, only to then see my wife further get killed by chemotherapy while trying to kill the cancer cells. Our goal is to help Alex survive without going through the severe side effects of treatment and chemotherapy. She is juicing, eating organic and very clean and finds it has already helped with some of the constant pain.   We have done extensive research and have found there have been excellent results with non-toxic immunotherapy, which, unfortunately, is not covered by our health insurance and is very expensive. Although we believe that there's a lot of good intention and care in traditional medicine, we can no longer only elect a treatment option with medications that cause so much harm to her body and might just give my wife another year or few months of life.  My wife and I have been doing non-stop research on the subject of alternative treatments and immunotherapy, we have educated ourselves on the different cancer treatments available and have been praying for guidance. Alex is determined to fight! We would like to give Alex the opportunity of beating this awful disease in a cancer center which offers more viable options for fighting this cancer. We have come to the conclusion that non-toxic immunotherapy and alternative treatment is a viable option that will benefit her at this time. We are aware that no treatment is 100% successful and nothing is guaranteed, but giving Alex the possibility of being here with her kids, family, friends and seeing our twin babies grow, means the world to me, my wife and our children. Many people have asked us how they can help us during this difficult time and although it is not our nature to ask for help, we must reach out so that my wife has every chance possible to beat this cancer. The life-saving treatment Alex needs does come with a cost, of approximately $45-100,000 and unfortunately, our health insurance would not assist as they would only cover traditional medicine. We have a limited amount of time to start alternative treatments and would need to get started soon.  Please be part of our journey by sharing our story as we ask for prayers for health and continuous guidance. If you feel so inclined, we would appreciate any financial help you can offer for the love of my life.

He is a sweet little boy who is at the beginning of his life.  While on vacation he became sick and during a trip to the emergency room, his parents learned a truth that they never could have imagined – that he has leukemia.  A vacation which began with relaxation and fun quickly turned into a flurry of tests, transfusions and unknowns that one should have to face – especially a 3 year old.  Once JoeJoe becomes stable, his parents will fly him home where they will begin an unimaginable journey at Sloan Kettering Hospital to check if the cancer has spread to his spine and then JoeJoe will begin chemotherapy.  While fighting beside their young son to get through this while also parenting his baby sister, Louis will need to take a leave of absence from work that will result in no income until he is able to return.  Any donation provided will help support this family with their living and medical expenses while they help little JoeJoe kick cancer in the butt and be one of the super heroes that he loves so much.  Thank you so much and please keep this family in your prayers.",472,2.1k,9,468,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Then a few days after the stroke, David needed emergency surgery to relieve swelling and bleeding in his brain. He had a large portion of his skull removed in order to save his life. David wears a helmet now, to protect his brain until the bone can be replaced.David's stroke has left him with speech, vision, and cognitive issues in addition to left side of the body paralysis, and he will need months, if not years, of exhausting rehab to maximize his ability to function.Unfortunately, insurance will pay for very little of it, leaving David and his wife Kathy with piles of bills.Before the stroke, David worked with special needs kids at North Central High School. Both he and Kathy have given so much to their community. Now they need our help. Our goal is to raise money for three essentials that will not be covered by insurance:• Structural modifications of David and Kathy’s home. This will include widening doorways, an entrance ramp, and a major remodel of their one small bathroom to install a wheelchair accessible shower, sink, and toilet. A conservative estimate of the cost of this work is about $30,000. • A wheelchair lift van to transport David to rehab. The speed and success of David’s recovery depends in large part on his ability to continue to receive therapy as frequently as possible.  A  dependable lift van will cost around $20,000. •     Costs of rehab that will exceed insurance limitations. The cost of months and months of rehab will exceed insurance limits by the tens of thousands of dollars.With gratitudeFriends of David and Kathy Tavitian",165,364,15,176,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,47,Pastor David's Cancer Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/PastorDavidsCancerFund,"SACRAMENTO, CA","March 12, 2018","$25,000","$34,250","On January 7, 2018, I was installed as the new Lead Pastor at Newport Covenant Church in Bellevue WA (Seattle’s Eastside). I was in Washington ahead of the rest of my family, because we had decided to let our youngest son Nathaniel finish the school year in Sacramento.I made the move despite experiencing digestive symptoms since late November. As I started at Newport, the symptoms kept getting worse. I became jaundiced, and I had more and more frequent bouts with back and stomach pain.In our wildest dreams, none of us would have predicted what lay ahead. On February 7, after my second surgical procedure in three weeks, I received the news that I have Stage 3 (possibly Stage 4) pancreatic cancer.I quickly learned that pancreatic cancer is a killer and is notoriously difficult to overcome. This was an extremely trying time for Susan and me, since she was still in Sacramento, and I was in Seattle.The weekend of February 9-11, we gathered our whole immediate family (Susan, two sons Spencer and Nathaniel, and daughter Lauren and her family) to talk about the sobering realities of pancreatic cancer – but also to weep and pray with one another.Shortly thereafter I became connected with one of the foremost experts in pancreatic cancer in the world, Dr. Vince Picozzi at Virginia Mason Medical Center. He agreed to be my doctor. We were overjoyed!Dr. Picozzi explained that the tumor was mainly growing out of the head of my pancreas, but it was not only in my lymph nodes but also attached to my biliary duct and nerves running to my back and abdomen. In addition, it may have metastasized to my liver. Thus, the tumor, in its current condition, is inoperable. Dr. Picozzi is attacking the tumor with chemotherapy in hopes that we can shrink it back to the point that it might become operable. Unfortunately there are no guarantees in any of this.As I write this, I have just completed my first month-long battery of chemo. The chemo has hit my body very hard, causing fevers, extreme fatigue, digestive problems, and – as of the last two days – loss of my hair. (I let Spencer and Nathaniel shave my head, and that is the photo you see.)Susan and Nathaniel had to scrap our plans for him to finish the school year in Sacramento. He is with us and is getting ready to begin a difficult transition to a new school, 2/3 of the way through his sophomore year.Financially this is a bit of a perfect storm for us. We have lost Susan's income, which we depend on to pay a portion of our bills. And now we have additional bills in the form of medical bills. So, income has dropped dramatically, and costs have risen. Not a good situation.Your GoFundMe donations would enable us to pay our medical bills and provide for Susan to spend a period of 3-6 months not working so she can (a) process this cancer diagnosis emotionally and (b) tend to her husband as he fights for his life and to her kids as they walk through this crisis.There are still a great number of unknowns (what treatment will look like down the road, what to do with our house in Sacramento, how soon Susan will need to start working, etc.). The financial needs addressed by this GoFundMe are ongoing and far reaching. Looking for other ways to support us? We are receiving a tremendous amount of support from the people at Newport Covenant Church, as well as from friends and family across the country – and outside the country. We would be grateful if you would follow our story on our CaringBridge page:  www.caringbridge.org/public/davidbeck, send us your encouragement, and pray for us. This situation hit us like a car t-boning us in an intersection. It was a total shock, and in many ways we are still catching up. With chemo incapacitating me large chunks out of every week, I am not able to be much help to Susan. We trust God and are not afraid – yet we feel the urgency of this situation every day. Thank you for supporting our family!",141,435,4,143,5 months,1 month ago,5 months,2018-09-03
Medical,47,Mary Huffman ALS Warrior,https://www.gofundme.com/MaryHuffman3,"GRANADA HILLS, CA","June 16, 2018","$40,000","$34,225","Below is an article that Cedars Sinai is doing about Mary on their new ALS website...  It however does a good job of telling just a bit of why Mary is so special to all of us.  As does this video:

Mary Huffman faces challenges and tries to help people.Growing up very poor with neither parent having a high school diploma (but they were awesome parents).  Mary decided she wanted a different future, and so she worked hard in school and got a B.A. from UCLA and an MBA from Stanford.  In addition, she wanted to use her time to help people (her mom taught her that early on), so she started volunteering in different ways in middle school and that has really brought her a lot of pleasure.  In addition to running an online marketing company, Mary decided to start an adult coloring book publishing company after she tried coloring and realized just how calming the activity is.  But she didn't like the format of the books because you had to be at a table and hold it open with one hand, and if you used markers, it would destroy the next page.  So, she designed a beautiful and practical new version with a friend and turned it into a thriving online business. If a wall is empty, she has an inspirational quote that can go there. If someone is in need, she finds a way to help.That much has stayed the same since she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, in September 2017. Every day is still about how she can help someone.""I wear a shirt with my philosophy on it,"" says Mary, 48. ""It says, 'ALS Mom. I'm going to Stephen Hawking the crap out of this.’""Those are Mary’s own words as she draws inspiration from the most famous person to have ALS since Lou Gehrig. Hawking, the brilliant theoretical physicist, lived and continued to work for more than half a century with the disease. ALS affects the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord that control muscle movement. A little more than 6,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease each year.So far, ALS is a disease without a solution. There isn't a cure in sight. Treatment is focused on improving comfort and quality of life. Mary was diagnosed with the fast-moving form of the disease, and now must stay in bed much of the time.One of the first things she did after being diagnosed in September 2017 was set up a website–Mary’s Legacy –devoted to helping people. She shares her story, photos, and a practical list of tips and life hacks for those with ALS or mobility issues. Her ""Mary's Life Tricks"" section is smart and sometimes funny advice for everything from taming the ""anxiety monster"" to handling criticism with grace. She updates it regularly and stays active in online ALS communities from her tablet computer.Friends call Mary a joy-bringer, a cheerleader, someone who can stay positive ""without being Pollyanna."" Sums up her 15-year-old daughter Anna, ""She's like Snow White, always  kind to everybody.”Mary met her husband, Ted Huffman, when she was 21, and their eyes met across a crowded room at a party. Within a few years, they were married and moving to Europe together. They worked and traveled there for 5 years, then came home to Southern California to start a family.""He has stuck with me through hundreds of adventures, and difficulties as well,"" Mary says. ""And he just has the greatest sense of humor.""Their two children, Anna and Jonny, age 13, are a lot like their mom in many ways. As a 3rd grader, Johnny started his first charitable fundraiser to help a younger kid who had cancer. He did the same when a teacher at his middle school had a brain tumor.After learning of her mother’s diagnosis, Anna asked a question that surprised and moved her mom.  “Should I live my teen years normally, making mistakes and learning? Or should I be perfect to make you proud?"" The answer came easy to Mary. ""I told her that being able to articulate that makes me so proud. Learn now. Don't wait to learn later.""Mary's room is lined from floor to ceiling with memories. Snapshots from her brother's recent wedding, vacation selfies, arms slung around friends and loved ones during some wonderful times. It includes new memories, too. Every visitor takes two selfies with Mary, a pretty portrait and a goofy one.Then there's a panoramic group shot of more than 60 loved ones, gathered around her at a party held last fall shortly after her diagnosis.  ""This has helped me so much to stay positive,"" Mary says. ""Just to have everyone smiling at me all day.""She spreads this positivity through her coloring book business, too. She just published a coloring book with a licensed social worker that combines anxiety-busting strategies with stress-relieving coloring exercises. It has some of her favorite features–the spiral at the top makes it lay flat and easy to color, thick pages, and a heavy cardboard backing so you can even color on your lap.Her drive to give back plays a role in her treatment at Cedars-Sinai. She's donated pages from her coloring books for Cedars-Sinai to share with other ALS patients and their families. She's on a waiting list to participate in clinical trials, hoping to contribute to ALS research. She likes that her care team has so many of the traits that she values.""Every single person I interact with is warm and caring and knowledgeable,"" she says. ""They all have good senses of humor. They make me feel so well cared for that, even going through this, I have the confidence that I'm getting everything I need.""",46,20,0,45,2 months,3 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,48,Recovery for Rebecca Berenson,https://www.gofundme.com/recovery-for-rebecca-berenson,"WORCESTER, MA","April 3, 2018","$30,000","$34,221","Imagine one day you are living your life, working, taking care of your family, exercising when you can because you know how important it is to take care of your health. But you haven’t been feeling that great lately. There’s always plenty of stress with balancing the special needs of your family – you are used to that, but this feels different. You are tired in a way you have never felt before. Never feeling quite right. You go to the doctor but they don’t come up with much, until a few months later when you wake up in excruciating pain with a blood clot in your spleen. You are admitted at a local hospital for several days with treatment for only the most obvious of your symptoms. After your release from the hospital your condition only gets a worse. You decide to request a second opinion at a major research hospital in Boston.  A few days later you meet with the doctor in Boston. After reviewing the results of a blood sample taken earlier that day, he asks in a matter of fact way, “Do you know why you’re here”? You recount your recent hospitalization and that fact that you haven’t been feeling well over several months. Like a hard punch in the gut, he states simply, “you have cancer”. You are admitted into the hospital immediately. A single word changes everything. Just. Like. That. Suddenly, unexpectedly, you are in the fight for your life. Since January, when my sister-in-law Rebecca and brother-in-law Chuck were given the news that she has a complicated form of AML Leukemia, it has been an unrelenting battle to ensure that she survives. After the initial diagnosis, she spent nearly a month at the Tufts Medical Center bone marrow transplant unit in Boston.  She is receiving her treatment from one of the most well-respected doctors for dealing with her specific form of leukemia. The planning for her bone marrow transplant is being mapped out in stages as the team assesses the progression of the disease and the logistics of lining up the donor. She was discharged to home but travels back and forth to Boston 2-3 times each week for testing, chemotherapy and radiation, but there have been a couple emergency hospitalizations to treat infections. Her immune system is down to zero as they prepare for the bone marrow transplant. In the meantime, she will continue to receive chemotherapy and radiation treatments. When the bone marrow transplant takes place, she will spend a month in the hospital. Once she is stable, she will be transferred to the Neely House apartments at Tufts, living in isolation in a special air filtered unit for two to four weeks more. There will be daily visits to see her doctor and someone must stay with her around the clock to assist with her care. It is a painful, brutal process, but Rebecca and Chuck are grateful for the expert care of her Tufts Medical team and hopeful that a donor will be confirmed soon. Those of you who know their family understand the challenges they face in coping with this overwhelming situation, as their youngest daughter Liza has complex special needs which require specific and intensive management with constant one to one care for all of her needs. Even though they have jobs and good medical insurance, Rebecca’s medical leave will run out in June when the school year ends. They will have to private pay for insurance through Cobra. With loss of income, co-pays, travel expenses, medical deductibles and additional specialized care and summer camp for Liza, the financial toll is real and overwhelming. It is frightening to witness how a medical diagnosis can put a family at risk for financial disaster while they are fighting to get better. In the best-case scenario, they will most likely be looking at 9 months to one year of recovery – with fingers crossed and as many prayers as can come their way. Many friends, co-workers, and neighbors have been extremely kind in sending well wishes, generous in making meals for the family and driving Rebecca to her appointments in Boston so Chuck can continue to work at least part time.  For all of this support we are truly grateful. I am starting this GoFundMe campaign as a way to allow them to concentrate on Rebecca getting well and to help relieve some of the financial stress they are dealing with in addition to everything else. So often when someone we know or love faces the unthinkable, we wish there was something, anything, we could do to help. It is my hope that those of you who know this family, and perhaps a few who don’t, will donate what you can as a way to show them your support and help them get through this. May they be fortunate enough to come out the other end of this ordeal healthy and strong. Please share this with anyone you think will want to know what Rebecca and Chuck and their family are dealing with and would want to help.With my sincere appreciation for your consideration,Paula Rosenblum",247,451,0,253,5 months,1 month ago,4 months,2018-09-03

In June of 2018 Claudia was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, which had spread to her lymph nodes, lungs and liver. Pancreatic cancer is usually terminal, especially at this stage,  and requires immediate and intense treatment. Standardized medical care guarantees only a 2% recovery rate, and requires aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, which also equally guarantees a poor and debilitating quality of life. After much prayer and research, Claudia has found an outstanding alternative and integrative medical and team and clinic, known for high rate of success in healing terminal cancer, and other chronic and traditionally incurable diseases. Furthermore they provide compassionate care, and are aligned with a philosophy that is true to Claudia’s core beliefs.  They are working alongside her as a team, allowing her to use her own expertise in holistic nutrition, superfoods, and natural supplements, while supporting her with the latest state of the art integrative medical treatment. Unfortunately, her insurance will not pay for the kind of treatment she has chosen. It is all out if pocket! As you’ll see from her updates, she is making significant progress, and would have not otherwise succeeded in making it this far with traditional treatment.  The 100% standardized chemo therapy dosage, as it was recently relayed to her by her integrative oncologist, would have put her in a coma in less than a month. She is extremely sensitive, and has been practicing and writing about holistic and alternative health and nutrition for decades. Initially the money required for treatment and the goal posted was $50K, which was to cover only the first 6 weeks of treatment, however after recent new tests Claudia had, dating 8/20/18 as per her doctors’  assessments, she needs to continue with 10 more weeks of medical care. They are now targeting her lungs too, both of which have numerous lesions and suspicious masses, one of a large measurement on the left side. In addition,  the latest Pet Scan had detected that there musculoskeletal system had been affected as well, and malignant lesions in several areas are present. Claudia will also begin slowly working to try to finance herself while still undergoing medical treatment, but your continued support will be of immense help. Claudia has always believed that true healing comes from nature, a supportive and spiritual environment, and from deep within ourselves. As an Integrative Holistic Health Counselor, Nutritional Chef, and yoga and meditation teacher, she lives what she teaches  and is known to go the extra mile to empower, support,  and inspire those around her.  Even a few days before she was diagnosed, short of energy and barely able to eat, she visited someone in the hospital to give them wellness and spiritual counseling, and cooked for her clients until the day she had to go to the emergency room, making sure they wouldn’t miss out on their healthy meals. She has dedicated her life to helping others facing mental, emotional and physical challenges, and those seeking to transition to a healthier mind-body-spirit lifestyle. Now, she is the one in need of our support. She is using her own healing modalities to heal herself combined with the help of an amazing team of alternative doctors, who support her holistic choices, providing her with the compassion and motivation which she has always shown to others. She bravely turned down traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which would only give her a 2% chance of survival. Those who know her well call her a warrior! She is not only fighting for her own life, but as she so often says “I am here fighting for everyone, so they can learn through me that cancer too can be overcome with the right integrative medical treatment and support, and through sheer faith, and will power!” Let’s help her achieve her goal, her medical expenses will far extend the amount we are asking. Please share this link with your various social media contacts or personal acquaintances, and kindly add a personal message to it, as this seems to make a big difference. You can read more about Claudia’s remarkable and brave story via her recent blog on her website ClaudiaGhetuWellness “How Cancer is Healing Me!” Claudia wants to live and help others by giving back. So many people like her are given a death sentence, but cancer doesn’t have to be an end, but a beginning!Claudia and her family are deeply grateful for your love, prayers and support.   With much love and gratitude.",236,586,12,255,2 months,9 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

The amount of love Beau has brought out of all who have come in contact with him can not be overstated.  We’re all taken back by how many lives Beau has impacted in such a short amount of time. Since Beau’s birthday on 5/23, many people have been asking how they can help.  So naturally, We have been asking everyone to pray for a miracle.  When we told Marlee and Jon that we were having so many people praying for a miracle their response was simply, “We already have our miracle, and it’s BEAU.”  The resolve and the strength of the Hale family is truly remarkable.  Riddled with adversity as they start their family, however, their Faith, love for each other, and their love for Beau is unconditional. We continue to ask for prayers for Marlee, Jonathan, and Beau as each day has its challenges.",266,1.4k,0,254,2 months,1 month ago,2 months,2018-09-03

Anna has idiopathic thoracolumbar scoliosis, a disorder of the spine that causes it to progressively curve sideways.  Anna was first diagnosed at age seven, and at age eleven she was put into a brace to slow the curvature and hopefully avoid surgery.  As her curves progressed, so did her pain.  She would wear two different types of braces for the next five years until age 16, when it appeared her curves had stabilized at 37 degrees each.    EMERGENCY SITUATION  Fast forward to March of 2018 when Anna suddenly had extreme pain that went beyond anything she had experienced prior.  Her medications did nothing to alleviate the pain.  By this time, Anna was married and living in Australia with her husband, Aaron.  Anna went to specialists in Australia and it was determined that her curves had unexpectedly progressed by over ten degrees.  X-rays also showed four bulging discs, one that was impinging on her sciatic nerve, as well as a severely degenerated disc.    Once the curves start progressing to these levels, surgery becomes necessary due to the impact on the spine and potential damage to the heart and lungs.  Although fusion surgery (where your spine is fused into a solid unit) is typically recommended, Anna is not a good candidate for this surgery due to the length of her curves and other factors.    A NEW SURGICAL OPTIONAbout 20 years ago, a new surgical technique was developed called Anterior Scoliosis Correction.  (For an explanation of this procedure, please click here .)  In this procedure, a pin is drilled into the side of each vertebrae and then a flexible cord is attached to each pin.  This technique has been proven to straighten the spine, alleviate chronic and acute pain and allow flexibility.      OUR FIRST MIRACLE!We began researching doctors in the United States who perform ASC on adults and we found only two.  The one closest to our state is also the same doctor who saw Anna when she was a child being treated at Shriner’s Hospital in Philadelphia!  Kim immediately contacted this doctor and shared what was happening with Anna and our journey toward ASC surgery began.ANNA IS APPROVED FOR THIS LIFE CHANGING SURGERYWe have now completed the pre-screening process and Anna has finally been officially approved for ASC surgery – currently scheduled to take place on July 30, 2018, in New Jersey.We praise God that He led us to retain Anna on our insurance policy after she married, but because it is a rare surgery for adults, the only doctors who can perform Anna’s surgery are out of network and it is not currently clear how much of the surgical costs will be covered by our insurance.  SURGERY & RECOVERY DETAILSAnna will be tethered from T5 – L4, meaning they will be putting pins in each vertebrae from the bottom of her neck to where her hips begin.  She is in a very tiny category of people who have ever been tethered that low on the spine.  Anna’s lungs will be deflated during the procedure (one side, then the other).   Provided all goes well, Anna will be in the hospital for one full week following her surgery.  We will then stay in a hotel near the hospital for 3-4 days to make sure everything is healing properly.  We will then (Lord willing!) return to our home in Mechanicsburg for Anna’s recovery.  OUR FINANCIAL NEEDWhile our insurance has yet to verify coverage of Anna’s hospital charges, we need to send a down payment of $45,000.00 plus a promissory note for $20,000.00 by June 30, 2018 to her surgeons.  In addition to these surgical fees, insurance is still determining our initial deductible, which will range from $10,000.00-$20,000.00.   As well, we need to fly Anna to the United States from Australia and then back to Australia after her surgery via business class (lie flat seating, with a current cost estimate of $8,500.00 for a one-way ticket).  Three to four nights of nearby hotel accommodations following hospital stay are also in view; in addition to other items we need to purchase for her recuperation for months afterwards (zero gravity chair, special padded bedding, etc.).   Your contributions will go toward Anna’s out of pocket medical expenses (before, during and after surgery) and travel/lodging expenses.  So, before confirmation of what insurance will pay, and in consideration of what other families have experienced, our current estimate of out of pocket costs is $85,000.00.  PRAYER NEEDSThe surgery is complicated and carries with it a number of risks.  Please pray that all goes well for her.  Our first meeting with the surgeons will be on 7/24/18 followed by surgery on 7/30/18.  Please pray for her travel from Australia to the US on 7/20-21/18, for our meeting with surgeons and for her preparations before surgery.   Please also pray for her incisions, for when they collapse her lungs, put in her pins and connect her tethers.  Please pray that the tethers they use would never break for her entire lifetime.  As you know, Anna has a history of infection with her leg surgery, so please pray for no infection.  Anna has endured much pain since she was six years old – chronic and acute.  For many people who undergo this surgery, they leave the hospital pain free.  For some the pain returns months after surgery.  Others experience a combination.  We are of course hoping and praying for total alleviation of pain that does not return.  Anna’s husband Aaron is on the brink of going into the Royal Australian Air Force (expected departure date is in July).  Please pray for both Aaron and Anna as they wait to hear definitive plans from the RAAF and as they deal with being away from one another at this time. We will keep you posted on this site and will update you as we journey into the next several months!  Thank you so much for considering supporting us in prayer and/or with your financial support.  Your encouragement and support means the world to us.    With love and prayers,Anna, Aaron, Joseph, Nate & Kim",128,472,10,130,2 months,12 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

At the age of 28, with an 18-month old son and husband in her corner, Kristen endured six months of chemotherapy to beat the advanced Stage IV cancer that had spread throughout her body. While this turned their world upside down, Kristen finished treatment in January 2017 and received the all clear that she had beat cancer—best news ever! With a renewed outlook, Kristen enjoyed life as healthy person again—not taking a single day of good health for granted. She celebrated her one year anniversary of being cancer free in January 2018 with friends, family and lots of champagne! Unfortunately, last month Kristen noticed swollen lymph nodes in her neck, an indicator of Hodgkin’s. Her doctor scheduled a PET scan, just to be safe, and the results indicated the worst: Kristen had relapsed. Kristen was sent to meet with a specialist at City of Hope where it was confirmed that the cancer had returned and now she must prepare to begin her second fight against Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.Kristen will be treated at City of Hope where they specialize in the advanced treatment of cancer. She will be entering a 12-week clinical trial before undergoing a stem cell transplant, a rigorous treatment that will require a month of isolation in the hospital where she will endure intensive chemotherapy followed by a transplant of her own stem cells. After the unforeseen financial consequences of fighting her first battle with cancer, we are asking for donations to help her continue her battle a second time! Any and all funds from this campaign will allow the Fournier’s to alleviate some of the financial burden that comes with a cancer diagnosis and help provide as much normalcy as possible to their son, Holden. Over the next year, Kristen, Jake and their families will be going back and forth from Orange County to City of Hope, which will require added expenses for childcare, lodging, transportation, food and healthcare costs. Every donation is sincerely appreciated as we help Kristen beat cancer once and for all so she can get back to a happy, healthy life. Please be kind enough to notify anyone who knows Kristen or has the ability to help!",167,352,0,165,5 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

He began to experience more serious symptoms such as fatigue, loss of strength, difficulty speaking, along with uncontrollable body tremors.In early March 2018, Wyatt’s symptoms became so severe he was forced to stop working, which affected his medical benefits through his employer.In April 2018, Wyatt and his family received the devastating news that doctors had diagnosed him with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Wyatt and his family were devastated by the diagnosis and are now left wondering what the future will hold.Wyatt currently lives in Corona, California with his wife, Justina, and their three boys, Landon (14), Austin (11) and Hudson (10). Wyatt’s parents, Ron and Suzanne, his brothers, Justin and Noah and their families, also live in the southern California area. The Boatright family is very strong and close-knit, but no one should be expected to go through this alone.Wyatt’s diagnosis will require serious on-going treatment and an extremely difficult road ahead. Since Wyatt can no longer work, his ability to support his family and pay medical bills will be greatly affected. He is an extremely humble person and recently told us that he didn’t want to be a burden to anyone.

Medical,49,Help Jacob Fight ALS  #GlasowStrong,https://www.gofundme.com/help-jacob-fight-glasowstrong,"REEDSVILLE, WI","July 19, 2018","$300,000","$33,988","My name is Jacob Glasow.  I am a 36 year old, father of 5 amazing children (ages 13, 10, 8, 7 & 3) and married to the love of my life, Sheena.  

On July 12th, 2018... my wife and I received news that turned our lives upside down...  the life altering diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.  ALS is a horrible disease, robbing its victims of the ability to walk, dress themselves, talk, swallow, and ultimately breathe. All while leaving the mind perfectly intact. 

Already, I’ve seen changes in my speech, I have twitching in my arm and leg muscles & am losing strength in my left hand and most recently, my smile has changed.   ALS has no cure and no effective treatment. 

The average lifespan from diagnosis is three to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for me and my family. What I do know is that we're focused on doing everything we can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages for as long as possible. As difficult and devastating as this diagnosis is, we remain positive and hopeful that through faith, hope & love, we will make it through this journey. 

A little about me: I’m an outdoors enthusiast and enjoy many activities like fishing (both open water and ice), hunting of all kinds & I especially love spending time with my family.   I am an easy-going, fun-loving guy who just enjoys the simple things in life... A cold beer, a steak on the grill hanging on the front porch with my family, watching my kids play in the yard, a bonfire with friends...    

One of my biggest fears on this journey is that my family will face extraordinary medical and incidental expenses. ALS treatment is not completely covered by insurance and estimates for medical costs alone range from $200,000-$300,000 EACH YEAR, covering ventilation, feeding tubes and in-home care. Additional large expenses may include modifying ones home for greater accessibility, wheelchairs, lifts, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, aides/in-home nursing and technological devices to offset muscle paralysis. 

No one knows how long my fight will last, but I’m determined to  battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be in the 10% of statistics that are here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this could leave a tremendous financial burden on my family & I cannot bear the thought of that. 

My wife, Sheena - who is a stay at home mom, and I have dedicated our lives to raising our  5 children and love our small, tight community in Reedsville, WI.  We are the average small-town family... our kids love playing outside and adventuring, riding their bikes, making forts in the yard and on the normal weeknight, you'll find us attending their baseball/softball games and sporting events in our community.  Outside of my full time job at Miron Construction, I also serve as a volunteer firefighter for the last 12 years for the Village of Reedsville.  

For those of you who are able to donate and help us face this growing mountain of expenses, we are deeply grateful. Your contributions are helping me to face this sad and difficult disease with dignity and pride. 

With Love,  
The Glasow Family  
(Jacob, Sheena, Mya, Ella, Grady, Hunter & Knox) 


A message from Jacob's wife, Sheena: 

We do not know exactly what our future holds but we REFUSE TO GIVE UP HOPE... he is strong...he has so much to fight for... so many people standing behind him... and we will exhaust all efforts to do whatever it takes to keep him strong and fighting! The kids do know what's going on and know that we are going to fight as a family, pray and keep hope to keep Daddy here for as long as we possibly can. We know we will need to lean on friends and family (which is definitely not a skill of mine) through this journey and we thank you all from the bottom of our hearts.  We want to enjoy each day as much as we can, make amazing memories... and make the most of times with our 5 beautiful children, friends and family.  Your donations will help us to do just that...while making it possible for Jacob to explore all options to FIGHT to be here as long as possible.

Her daughter, Drew, who is 29 years old,  has just been diagnosed with breast cancer, and her medical bills have already depleted her savings. As she has just started treatment, she has a way to go and needs help.  So I started the GoFundMe page to help.  Drew is a beautiful girl and is trying to be positive through all this.  She has written something, so we can all get to know her and listen to her story:""Buzzzzzzz Bizzzzzzzzz Buzzzzzzippp.The sound of the clippers made a ringing in my ears, with a wicked finality. Locks of my beautiful red hair fell in clumps to the floor as my mother shaved the remaining bits of my head. She tried to keep it together as tears streamed down my face. My crowning glory, the trait that people recognized me by most, was now in a heap on the floor. Just a few short weeks prior, I was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer.  A shock to my friends and family, and most especially me. I am 29 years old. But to start, you must know that I LOVE my life and I LOVE to laugh. I'm a fiery Texan, and I find humor in dry wit, fun in dressing in my vintage clothing and pin curls, and great joy in a slice of very cheesy pizza. And believe me, I enjoy all those things regularly in my now home base of New York. On top of all of those things, I love my job, a company where I am able to be my best lady-hustler self. Late last fall, the company hosted several cancer awareness events, including a bake-off where the proceeds went to Susan G. Komen. My little pink ribbon sprinkle cookies won the taste test and my company donated to Susan G. Komen in my honor! Following the bake-off, we had a young breast cancer survivor come and tell her story, a harrowing tale by a woman who's about the same age as me and my many under-30 coworkers. I consider myself fully supportive of women's issues (after all, I’m a woman myself!), but neither the bake-off nor the talk seemed to have much true weight at the time. How could they? I was happy and healthy, after all. Something from those events must have subconsciously taken hold though because a few weeks later, I did a self-examination, finding a golf ball size lump. The radiologist couldn’t look me in the face while going over the mammogram. She kept asking, “how old are you?”, in disbelief of what she was seeing on her screen. Though she hadn’t yet said the words, I knew from the look on her face that the diagnosis wasn’t in my favor. Considering the circumstances, it seemed ironic. My company had just donated money to a cause which one day I could potentially be a beneficiary. I just hadn’t known it at the time. How could I, a young woman so happy, have gotten hit by life so hard? It was surreal. Since the diagnosis, the doctors have come up with the plan for chemo first (a whopping 15 treatments!) and surgery later, hoping the chemo will shrink the tumors considerably before I go under the knife. I put on a happy face, but the truth is, the side effects of the treatment are much rougher than I lead on. There is the chronic exhaustion (which has affected my ability to walk around the city I love); I have gotten poked and prodded by more needles than I can count; I had a port implanted into my chest (which upset me to no end to have a scar in a very visible place); I have undergone a series of uncomfortable fertility treatments (who knew chemo could leave you infertile?!); I’ve had a lot of long, tough conversations about things I never thought I would discuss, and of course I’ve lost my beautiful red hair. But no matter how ill or tired I feel, I'm at the office most days, with a big smile on my face, attacking my daily goals like a ninja. Very few acquaitances or people at the office know I have cancer, and I'm proud of that, knowing I can maintain some sense of normalcy and still be perceived as the lady-hustler I always want to be! Plus, a very good auburn wig helps! And my personal life is also full of smiles, with friends and family checking in all the time, bringing over meals, and sending as many Beyonce gifs as possible (because what day isn't made better with a Beyonce gif?!). Despite my many blessings, the fact is I still have cancer, and I very simply need help. Because I have an income, I am not qualified for most financial aid. And while I do have insurance through my job, it only covers a portion of the medical bills, and those medical bills far exceed my income. I’m living a catch-22 where if I were qualified for the aid, I wouldn’t have a job. But because I do have a job, I am able to receive the insurance, which still doesn’t cover many of the bills. I am currently living in between a rock and a hard place. At the moment, I’ve depleted my savings after only the first 3 months of my treatment. With a very long road ahead, the stress of where the funds are coming from to pay the upcoming medical bills is almost as bad as the cancer itself. Thank you to all my friends and family for your love and support, and providing me the courage to speak very publicly about something so private. And thank you to those who take the time to read my story and want to help. With love and hope for a healthy future, Drew""",296,712,2,303,6 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

It is highly unlikely that Jim will be able to return to work in 2018.Jim and Mary Kay need your help as they navigate through this journey.Although they do have insurance, it does not cover all expenses. We are asking for your donations to help them with the following:·      Additional Medical expenses·      Travel to/from Johns Hopkins (should he be accepted)·      Travel to/from another treatment center or clinical trial (TBD)·      Housing for out of state treatment (patients do not stay in the hospital throughout the duration of the transplant procedure, but must find near by housing)·      Home health care provider to assist Jim at the off-site housing·      Loss of Income·      Daily living expensesMany of you have already generously offered to be a bone marrow donor.  Unfortunately, it’s not like offering to donate your Type A+ blood to his.

The doctors said it was about a 9/10 severity. He is now with my mom at the rehab facility trying his best to recover.  As you can imagine, his dementia has severely slowed his progress and Medicare’s coverage is coming to an end.My fathers’ strokes have resulted in a series of blood clots that have now manifested themselves in my father’s lungs. The doctors were able to dissolve some of these clots with the use of blood thinners, but he is now suffering from DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and his leg is extremely swollen, making it even more difficult to walk again. We were informed that he will probably never live at home again.Thank God my parents have some long-term health care, but as you may know, the costs are EXTREMELY high.  With the coverage we need for both of them, we will be unable to afford the costs in only a few years.  With both parents out of work, and in rehab with limited medical coverage, it has become ever more critical to pay for the recovery process.  This will most likely be for a caregiver for our mom and a nursing home for our dad.   Anything you can give would be an absolute blessing.Love you all.  Life is precious,  Emma & Dane",233,269,5,234,1 month,27 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

What they thought was routine MRI as a precaution before scheduling a common surgery to correct Valentina’s lazy eye turned into their worst nightmare. Little Valentina, only 18-months old was diagnosed with a tumor on her brainstem. This one routine test and unexpected medical answer turned the Guiulfo Gamallo’s family life upside down. Instead of heading home to play with her big brother, six-year-old, Mauricio, Valentina was immediately admitted into Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.The neurosurgeon explained that the tumor was in a very difficult area to access, as a surgery to remove it could cause devastating and irreversible damage to Valentina's vital functioning. Yet, they needed to perform an emergency surgery to release the fluid accumulating in the ventricles of her brain—causing it tremendous pressure, and they also needed to perform a biopsy of the tumor. In a little less than a month, Valentina has undergone three surgeries: the emergency surgery to release brain pressure and to autopsy the tumor, a second one to place a shunt on her brain to drain the fluid and reduce pressure, and a third to insert a port where chemotherapy will be administered. The tumor is not cancerous but it is also too dangerous to remove, so we all remain hopeful that a long-term chemotherapy treatment, beginning on July 12th, will reduce the Grade1 tumor. The tumor, or as little brother, Mauricio is calling it, “the cloud” has begun impeding Valentina’s eyesight, so she is wearing a patch for most of the day at the recommendation of her pediatric ophthalmologist. Nevertheless, Marcelo, Jocy, Mauricio, and Valentina – along with their family and friends all over the world – are ready for the fight of their lives. Valentina, meaning “healthy and strong” needs your help, love, support, and prayers as she fights for her life—she truly is “Valentina the Brave.” The Guiulfo Gamallo’s have a long road ahead of them. One that will be exhausting both physically and emotionally but also financially. They are deeply grateful to their family and friends for their continue support and willingness to help. Already in this journey, they have found wonderful people ready to give them a hand to help or a hug to comfort what they are going through. The doctors and nurses have been doing a phenomenal job and doing their very best for Valentina’s health. The prayers are coming from around the world and from different religious, which is helping this family to keep strong and faithful.Please consider helping this amazing family with a donation so they can continue to provide Valentina (and of course, big brother, Mauricio) with the love, energy, and care they deserve during this particularly challenging time. Thank you for listening to the beginning of this story – it is a journey, and they will need us all in it for the long haul. Keep up your prayers for Valentina the Brave._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________El miércoles 13 de junio de 2018 fue un día que Marcelo y Jocy nunca olvidarán. Lo que ellos pensaban que era una resonancia magnética de rutina antes de programar una cirugía común para corregir el estrabismo de Valentina, se convirtió en su peor pesadilla. A la pequeña Valentina, de sólo 18 meses, le diagnosticaron un tumor en el cerebro. Esta única prueba de rutina y una respuesta médica inesperada cambiaron la vida familiar de los Guiulfo Gamallo. En lugar de que Valentina regresara a su casa para jugar con su hermano mayor, Mauricio (de seis años), ella fue hospitalizada de inmediato en el Hospital de Niños de Atlanta.El neurocirujano les explicó que el tumor estaba en un área muy difícil de acceder,  y que una cirugía para extirparlo podría causar daños devastadores e irreversibles en el desarrollo de Valentina. Sin embargo, se necesitaba realizar una cirugía de emergencia para obtener una biopsia del tumor y liberar el líquido que se acumulaba en los ventrículos de su cerebro, causando a su vez presión en el nervio óptico.En poco menos de un mes, Valentina ha tenido tres cirugías: la cirugía de emergencia para liberar la presión en el cerebro y obtener la biopsia del tumor, una segunda para colocar una válvula en el cerebro para drenar el líquido y reducir la presión, y una tercera para insertar un puerto donde se administrará quimioterapia. El tumor no es canceroso, sin embargo, debido a su ubicación, es muy peligroso para remover, por lo que Valentina necesitará un tratamiento de quimioterapia a largo plazo, el cual comenzará el 12 de julio para reducir el tumor de Grado 1. El tumor, o como su hermano Mauricio lo llama, ""una nube"" ha comenzado a afectar la visión de Valentina, por lo que ella está usando un parche por recomendación de su oftalmólogo pediátrico en su ojito hasta que Valentina haya superado la quimioterapia y el tumor se haya reducido. A pesar de todo esto, Marcelo, Jocy, Mauricio y Valentina, junto con sus familiares y amigos de todo el mundo, están listos para afrontar el mayor reto de sus vidas. Valentina, que significa ""saludable y fuerte"", necesita de la ayuda de todos, amor, apoyo y oraciones mientras ella lucha por su vida y demuestra que ella es realmente “Valentina la Valiente"". Los Guiulfo Gamallo tienen un largo camino por delante. Uno que será agotador tanto física como emocionalmente, pero también financieramente. Ellos están profundamente agradecidos con sus familiares y amigos por su continuo apoyo y voluntad de ayudar. Ya en este camino difícil, han encontrado personas maravillosas listas para darles una mano o un abrazo reconfortante para sobrellevar por todo lo que están pasando. Los doctores y enfermeras han estado haciendo un trabajo increíble y velando por el bien de Valentina. Las oraciones vienen llegando de todo el mundo y de diferentes religiones, lo que ayuda a esta familia a mantenerse fuertes y con fe para superar esta difícil travesía. Por favor, considera ayudar a esta asombrosa familia con una donación para que puedan seguir brindando a Valentina (y por supuesto, a su hermano mayor, Mauricio) el amor, la energía y la atención que merecen durante este momento particularmente difícil. Gracias por escuchar el comienzo de esta historia: es una travesía difícil, y nos necesitarán a todos en el largo plazo.

I was placed on a blood thinner with instructions that if I had pain in my upper back an emergency room visit was required because a clot could have broken loose and traveled to my lungs. This could cause a pulmonary embolism which was potentially life threatening. On December 17, 2017 due to pain in my upper back, my wife and I visited the emergency room.  A chest X-ray and a CAT scan of my upper abdomen were taken. While there was no pulmonary embolism, the emergency room doctor said the test showed lesions in my liver and swollen lymph nodes in my chest. The emergency room doctor's opinion was that there was cancer coming from somewhere in my body. I was admitted to the hospital. Extensive testing on December 18th revealed a tumor in my pancreas, numerous lesions in my liver, and the beginning of tumors in my right lung. The doctors at EJ hospital concluded that there was a high probablity of pancreatic cancer that had spread to other oragns. I began consultaion with MD Anderson hospital in Houston on December 27, 2017. Three visits to MD Anderson between December 27th and January the 8th confirmed that it was in fact stage 4 pancreatic cancer as proven by a biopsy of my liver. The doctors at MD Anderson informed me that my condition was potentially treatable, but not curable. Because the cancer had evacuated the pancreas. The  oncologist at MD Anderson and the oncologist at EJ Hosptial agreed that the best potential treatment would be chemotherapy. Several complications arouse which delayed the beginning of my chemo therapy treatment. Finally, chemo therapy started on Valentines day of 2018. I have had a total of 3 treatments so far which last 6 and half hours per treatment, and are very difficult to recover from.  At least 4 more treatments are scheduled prior to a CAT scan. These will reveal if the chemo therapy is working on the tumor. Further treatment will be based on the result of that CAT scan.""All donations are greatly appreciated during this difficult time.

He has always said, “I don’t know why I was given this challenge in life, but I will make the most of it.” That is why, after being diagnosed with Auto-Immune Hepatitis, Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Crohns at the age of eight, he became an advocate for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America.  He wanted to help people and their families living with Crohns and Colitis. He became the “Face of Crohns” for the Rolf Benirschke Legacy Golf Tournament and was a speaker at their annual fundraiser for over ten years.  After eight years, Brandon’s liver deteriorated to a point where he needed a liver transplant. He was jaundice, tired and slept all the time. He had to finish high school on home hospital.   We sold our house, moved into an apartment and after graduation, he and my mom moved to Indiana because the wait time there was only weeks compared to years in California. That is when we learned that Indiana is an “opt out” state, which means that you are automatically a donor unless you “opt out.”After waiting only seven and a half weeks, Brandon received the “perfect” liver!   We now celebrate 8-10-12 as his 2nd birthday!  Brandon and my mom returned home in November, just in time for Thanksgiving. We had so much to be thankful for! While he was home recuperating from the transplant, he added Donate Life to his personal causes and began speaking to high school students about the importance of being a donor. He wants to change California to an “opt out” state, so that it will shorten the wait time for patients on the transplant waiting list. After taking the year off to recuperate from the transplant, he started college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo studying Engineering.  Managing his health while attending school proved to be difficult. For the last three years, he has suffered with daily nausea, jaundice and extreme fatigue. His disease of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis is back and has resulted in chronic Intrahepatic Ductopenic Rejection and Cirrhosis of the liver. Brandon needs to have a 2nd Liver Transplant.  His case will be presented April 27th  in order to get on the Transplant list.  Because it still takes about 3+ years in California, the plan is to let Brandon finish college in June and then Brandon and my mom will move to Indiana and wait for his 2nd “perfect” liver.  Brandon needs our help!  He is humble and would never ask for himself, but as his sister and as a long-time admirer of his courage, his spirit and his downright perseverance, I'm saying it.   There's no way of sugar-coating this: Brandon needs this transplant!   It's obviously a very serious surgery, and one that I know he is not looking forward to enduring, but he perseveres by staying focused on the hope of feeling better and regaining his strength and energy.  Thankfully our health insurance will cover the transplant, but there are aspects of care and recovery (including the high deductible, copays, medication, living expenses in Indiana, and much more), which are not covered by insurance.  For the first year after a transplant, a patient remains at high risk for rejection, and there are many costs associated with monitoring and guarding against this, as well as with recuperation. After-care is crucial, and it's expensive. That's where we can help.Brandon’s transplant team has advised that he should have a large contingency fund in place, which can be put towards these costs. The sums are enormous, so I'm setting up this fundraising campaign. Please give what you can and spread the word. Brandon Facon is an amazing brother and person. He is facing a very tough time ahead and we can help make it a little easier and less stressful. Thank you for reading Brandon’s story and for considering a donation. Here's a brief note from Brandon: I am proud that I have been able to make a positive contribution with my life so far and hope I have been worthy of it.  Living with chronic health issues is a challenge, but living at all can be a challenge. I have been lucky to have a mission and to know it from a very young age. People work their whole lives to leave their mark on this world with the desire to make a difference, to be remembered, to be someone’s hero. They go to school to gain knowledge so that they will achieve success, some develop their talents in athletics, music, or theater to be in the spotlight, while others choose to get married and raise families. The paths may be different, yet the desire is the same. People want to make a difference, to be remembered, to be someone’s hero. My first liver donor, Erica, didn’t know at the time, but she would become my hero just six years after she made that selfless decision and I am forever grateful. I pray now for my next liver donor and am thankful for their decision to be a donor.I want to thank you in advance for your donations, for you are making a difference in my life.  I know my health will be restored!  I have so much to accomplish and need to get busy living my life to the fullest and cherishing each and every day!  And yes, like Erica, I have that pink dot on my license too, do you?Donate Life Float at the Rose Parade back in 2013!Brandon's Neon Film Display.

Medical,50,Fund for Russ' Standing Chair,https://www.gofundme.com/austindaze1,"AUSTIN, TX","May 15, 2018","$30,000","$33,499","Russ Hartman needs your help to fund his new electric wheelchair!  This new chair would allow him to stand up and wheel himself around electronically, aiding him as he strives to be more independent.  After testing the chair out for himself, he checked with his insurance to see if they could help.  They might be able to cover a portion of the cost, but unfortunately not enough of it.  So, now we're reaching out to all of you to see if we can raise the rest of the funds to get him in the new chair.To tell you a little about Russ, he's played a major part  in shaping Austin into the community that it is today.  As editor of the Austin Daze, he's dedicated himself to showcasing and promoting local art in all forms.  He's made it his mission to not only unite people from all walks of art, but to bring the Austin community closer together as a whole.  Most importantly, he's been a great friend and inspiration to all of us around town. Aside from his honorary band member status in so many local bands, Russ has helped a ton of great artists get their start on the roads they walk today.  With each interview conducted, issue printed, gig booked, and event covered, Russ has done everything with one major thing on his mind, building the surrounding local community and making sure everyone's having the best time that they can at the best gigs in town.Those who know Russ well, know about his addictively positive attitude that he exudes each day no matter what's thrown his way.  He's combined that attitude with a fiercely independent spirit and incredibly strong drive to create his family (every one of you!) here in Austin.We now have an opportunity to help Russ out and get him cruising in one of the most badass wheelchair's ever!  Check out the video at the top of the page to see the test drive in action.  This chair not only allows him to stand up and stretch his legs out, but he'll also become more mobile and will be able to wheel around standing up!It'd be awesome if we could all band together and help raise the funds to make this chair a reality for him! Your help mean so much and anything that you could give is very much appreciated!   There also will be a benefit show(s) coming, so be on the lookout and be sure to come out and support.  All funds raised will go directly toward Russ’s new wheelchair, allowing him to get around more easily, independently and efficiently.  You'll be seeing Russ at all of his favorite clubs around town, dancing in his new chair. Thank you to everyone for your contributions!For those of you that don't know who I am or how I fit into this whole thing,  I'm Russ' cousin, Greg.  I lived down in Austin with him for 20+ months.  I got to see firsthand what an awesome dude my cousin really is while I lived down there.  I can tell you that this wheelchair would definitely be a game changer for him.  It would make it much easier for him to do things independently and it would allow him to do so many of the daily tasks that he needs to do, wants to do, and loves to do.  Thanks for your support!",99,481,3,100,3 months,8 hours ago,2 days,2018-09-03

Medical,51,HELP ROBIN,https://www.gofundme.com/httpswwwgofundmecomkatzx3-help-robin,"BOCA RATON, FL","August 9, 2018","$25,000","$33,466","July 4th, 2002. The Hannoun family departs from France to South Florida to start a new life in the United States. Even though it meant leaving the remainder of the family behind, the two young children, David and Robin, are so excited to get to a life of sunshine and rainbows (literally) and get away from all of the negative stigma that France held for them. “We’re never going back,” Robin said to David as they both saw the Independence Day fireworks streaming through the sky, something they’d never even thought about in their young days in France. Well, funny how life turns out sometimes.Fast forward to June 2018. Robin, now 21 years old, has just returned from a trip to Asia and is starting his first professional internship at an investment firm in Tampa, FL. He has a bit of a headache and is feeling nauseous, but he just shrugs it off as nerves or bad Chipotle or something like that. A week goes by, still the same feeling of nausea. He starts to seek medical attention, going to see a few different medical professionals in the South Florida area. No one is able to tell him what’s wrong with him.Rightfully worried and concerned, he decided to take matters into his own hands. Despite how the two brothers felt about France, there is one thing that is undoubtedly true – the healthcare system is miles ahead of that of the United States. So, Robin got on a flight to France, not even booking a return flight because he knew something was wrong. This was Friday, June 29th. He landed in Paris at 1:00 PM. By 3:00 PM, he found out he had a benign tumor in the left ventricle region of his brain. With his grandfather a highly regarded doctor throughout France, he was able to get in the care of Professor Parker, one of the world’s leading practitioners in neurosurgery. Robin met with him that Saturday; within a few minutes, he was scheduled for intensive brain surgery for that Tuesday, July 3rd.Everyone’s life changed. His mother, who was with his sister in New York for a dance competition, booked a flight to France immediately. His brother, who lives and works in Atlanta, did the same. His father was already in France, but now, there were no plans of returning to the States. Everyone was there for Robin when he got out of surgery, and we were all so impressed and pleased by the man we saw.Literal moments after getting out from brain surgery, when it normally takes weeks or even months to be able to move, Robin was stretching his arms and rotating his legs back and forth. He was conversing with us, he was completely conscious, and he was kicking his recovery’s ass. In fact, he was able to walk by himself within 2 days, something which usually takes several months for patients with a similar surgery. We were all so happy and pleased with how everything was going, and quite honestly, so was he.And then came the next piece of the story. Robin’s benign tumor had been sent to the lab for biological analysis just as standard procedure, and as it turns out, it actually wasn’t benign at all; in fact, it was quite the opposite. What Robin had gotten removed was a malignant medulloblastoma, a cancerous tumor which turns out had metastasized into  another region of his brain. Long story short, he had brain cancer, and needed to get treatment right away.Robin was then sat down and told the plan, the plan that would ultimately determine the most basic thing – his survival. Regular sessions of chemotherapy followed by regular sessions of radiotherapy. He would perform all of these in France over the coming months.Now, the hardest part for most cancer patients isn’t the physical symptoms and reaction to the therapy; the hardest part, by far, is the mental part. Staying positive amongst all of these negatives, keeping faith in the process even when your platelets get so low that you have to get a transfusion that doesn’t even work because you’re so depleted that your vein literally bursts when plucked with a needle, or being able to tell yourself that you’re going to get through this even when there is no indication or certainty at all. This isn’t like a common cold, or breaking a bone, or twisting an ankle. This is cancer, and nothing is certain.So how does this apply to Robin? Well, he has always been a fighter; when it comes to the physical symptoms, he’s reacting very well and he himself is not worried about them. The mental part is a different story. Remember how when he and his brother were little kids, he told David “We’re never going back.” Well, he meant it. He never wanted to go back and spend extended amounts of time in France, much less live there while getting treated for arguably the worst type of cancer known to man. So, it’s needless to say that not only is the treatment tough, but he is incurably homesick, misses his friends, his habits, his familiarity of living in the US. And while we can’t literally bring the US to him, one thing we can do is bring the next best thing – his friends.Robin has a crew, a group of several young men who all call each other best friends, and they all would be willing to do anything for one another. The goal of this fundraiser is to pay for biweekly trips to France for Robin’s best friends to come see him, to establish some sort of resemblance of home and bring some happiness and familiarity back into his life as he goes through and fights this horrible disease. As they say, even the smallest of lights shines bright if it’s in the darkest of places. Help us save Robin. Help us save my brother.David Hannoun",319,761,5,335,24 days,8 hours ago,21 days,2018-09-03

The separation then causes blistering. Blisters can occur with even the slightest bit of friction to Danni Jo's skin. Danni Jo is still healing from blistering sustained during the birthing process and continues to develop new blisters daily despite the amazing 24 hour care she’s receiving from doctors, nurses, Austin, and Chris in the NICU. To combat blistering and infection, Chris and Austin must keep Danni Jo covered in Aquaphor  and work as a team to bandage her entire body from the neck down at least once a day to help protect her skin. Danni Jo is tough as nails just like both of her parents and she’s eating well and getting stronger everyday. This will be a long journey ahead for  Christopher, Austin, and Danni Jo as EB is a lifelong condition. Medical costs for people with EB can be astronomical at up to $10,000 per month for special equipment and medical supplies alone, plus doctor visits, special clothing and bedding, and more. Most insurance  companies have a cap on the amount covered for medical equipment specifically and only Chris will be able to work due to the constant care that Danni Jo will require. We are asking anyone who has it in their heart to help donate to this beautiful new family, and help our little Danni Jo on her journey ahead. Austin and Chris are both military veterans with Austin serving in the Air Force and Chris in the Army stationed with the 173rd in Bamberg Germany and Logar province Afghanistan from 2009-2012.

It’s her way of life in its simplest form. Enjoy every moment as tomorrow is not promised.  Loved fiercely by so many, she personifies what it means to live life to the fullest. Some of the hallmarks of being Aida are her sunny but caring personality, quick wit, and no filter responses to life's unpredictability. From New York City, to Arizona, to Florida she has amassed a circle of friends and loved ones who would do anything and everything for her. She is everyone's biggest cheerleader. If you ask anyone of her friends they will tell you ""She is my best friend.” She makes everyone feel as if they are the most special person in her life. That is the essence of who she is. June 2016,  held the promise of  a wonderful summer to look forward to with warm sunny days, beach plans, catching up with friends and family. Little did she know it would be the beginning of a journey that was unimaginable.  After months of enduring pain that would not dissipate she finally decided to go to the doctor to determine the cause.  Like millions of women across the world, she’s diagnosed with breast cancer – Stage 3 later developing into Stage 4. After months of chemotherapy, radiation and a double mastectomy seven months later, she seemed fine. Unfortunately Aida's cancer continued to progress. The most recent diagnosis as of Saturday, Monday, May 19th is that the cancer has progressed to a brain condition called Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LC). It is a rare complication of cancer which spreads to the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. LC occurs in approximately 5% of people with cancer and is terminal. This causes blurred vision, strenuous headaches, causes the body to clamp up with no mobility, unable to speak clearly (slurring of words) where she cannot be understood and increased pressure in the brain. These episodes are increasing day-by-day. The doctors determined that a shunt surgery would stabilize the pressure that is in her brain. Monday, May 20th she will undergo this procedure. Our Princess Warrior’s hope and faith for a cure and longer life have never wavered.  She hasn’t stopped laughing and enjoying her time with family and friends. Her will to live has never diminished. God is wonderful and has blessed her with the greatest group of supporters!The doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are in search of different types of treatment to extend her life. The treatments are costly, one that will require the help of all of us coming together to relieve strenuous and costly medical bills . The situation is urgent!  We have created this Go Fund Me in hopes that collectively, all of Aida's loved ones can raise the money to pay for treatment. These funds will be a tremendous help as she explores all avenues that can lead to a potential life-saving treatment. We appreciate you taking the time to read this appeal and considering a donation to this urgent cause.

As a brain cancer survivor for the past two years, she continues to show a poise and elegance while enduring the latest treatments provided by Memorial Sloan Kettering to battle this disease. At the onset of it all, Pam decided to become an active participant and survivor by joining the newly formed NJ chapter of the National Brain Tumor Society. The Molloy's Marchers have been the #1 fundraising team for the non-profit organization for the past 2 years.  Pam was raised in Glendora California by Pat and Gil Riley along with her sister Sherri. She moved to Manhattan in her 20’s, fell in love and married her soul-mate, Steve. From the beginning, this high-fashion clothing buyer exemplified style, elegance and poise. She left the work force and stayed home to raise her family. Her love for her two boys, Jack and Alec, combined with her knowledge of industry helped birth the business she called “Tickle Toes.” It was never about money and she eventually sold the business to have more time for her family and community.

Medical,51,Mac's Battle With Ewing's Sarcoma,https://www.gofundme.com/macchilders,"PORTLAND, OR","March 28, 2018","$35,000","$33,248","On Valentine’s Day, our world came to a halt when Mac was diagnosed with a rare childhood cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma. What had been a nagging pain in his leg turned out to be the last thing any parent wants to hear: that their child has cancer. No one wants to think that this can happen, let alone to a child that we love — our smart, funny, interesting, and creative twelve year-old Mac.        Mac has been under the care of doctors at Doernbecher's Children's Hospital at OHSU in Portland. After the diagnosis, he quickly began chemotherapy and just finished his second round. It is an excruciating schedule: he is inpatient for all his chemo which is every other week, anywhere from 2-5 days.  All totaled, he spends about half the month in the hospital.  Mac has to endure 7 rounds of chemo and then will undergo an extensive surgery in May to remove the tumor and rebuild his leg.   After surgery, Mac will be non weight-bearing for at least three months! He will be in a wheelchair and eventually on crutches if possible. He will require constant care. He only gets  a couple weeks reprieve and then begins several more months of chemotherapy after surgery.      All in all, Mac is facing nearly a year of treatment, hopefully getting his last round of chemo before Christmas. Mac’s prognosis is good, and we are all counting on a clean bill of health and a joyous return to normal life once this process is over.  However, it is a daunting year ahead. It will be filled with much worry, suffering, and demanding care — and also with strength, wisdom, love, and support. Our family has felt the love pour in from so many, and now we are asking for your support.   It is difficult to ask for help, but the year ahead will have many trials, including financial. Mac’s chemo schedule requires Laura and Kelby to join him in the hospital (there is no place they would rather be) and then at least one of them must be home to help when he’s sick. Kelby continues to work when Mac is not in the hospital, and his fire department has been unbelievably supportive with offers to cover his shifts and be flexible with his needs.    As many of you know, Laura has her own private practice and so when she doesn't work she doesn't get paid. Her schedule has already been vastly reduced, seeing clients when she can.  They have insurance, but many things are not fully covered.  Here is an idea of some things they have immediate needs for:   *  Wheelchair ramp for Mac * Bathroom remodel to accommodate wheelchair and non-weight bearing status * Laptop for Mac to video conference with his class to keep up with his schoolwork * Knee scooter, wrist crutches and other devices not covered by insurance * Supplementing Laura's loss of income for a year            This all comes at a great cost, and that is why we are asking for your support. Mac is doing the hardest work of all, and the greatest gift is enabling Laura and Kelby to have the ability to care for him during this unimaginably difficult year. By easing some of the financial stress, you would be directly helping Laura and Kelby devote all their resources to caring for Mac and helping insure that he has the best support possible for the fight ahead.        Here are some words about Mac from a dear family friend:   Mac is an incredible friend to so many. He has grown up as a Candalaria Husky and is now an exemplary student at Howard Street Charter Middle School in Salem. Mac delights in the ordinary, and extraordinary experiences that life has to offer. He is zealous about being a keeper of tradition, finding meaning and belonging in annual trips to the Polar Express with family and friends and annual Easter hunts in the back yard with neighbors. He can transform a trampoline or a dining room table into a fortress of fun and innovation. He is an encyclopedia about all things Lego, Marvel, Magic and Star Wars. He loves to create movies and animations of his own that express his interests, talents and showcase his great sense of humor. Mac has an abiding love for dogs, especially his 3 labs, Brick, Lego and Leia. It is not uncommon to find him piled up in a snuggly blanket with one or more of his canine companions. Mac finds points of connection with anyone who lends him an ear.

This means that he is paralyzed from his mid-chest down with partial paralysis in his right leg and complete paralysis in his left leg, leaving him unable to walk. He also has sensory deprivation mid-chest down that makes him unable to distinguish between dull and sharp touch; as well as, temperature variations.Anyone who has met our dad knows what a determined and optimistic person he is. Through all of life’s uncertainty, he has maintained a positive outlook and helped others in any way possible. Although the doctor’s prognosis from his SCI is uncertain and we are still awaiting a diagnosis, he has not accepted this as his personal reality and is exemplifying the strength of his spirit by challenging himself everyday. Through this trial he has been motivated and eager to put in the hard work necessary to regain the ability to walk, something many of us take for granted, so that he too can experience the little joys life has to offer, like back packing with his children, river rafting, and dancing with his daughter at her wedding.The road to walking again will be intense, but our dad is prepared to do everything in his power to get there! Although we are currently looking at a two-year (at best) time frame for his recovery, it is crucial to have continuous physical therapy throughout this journey and to ensure that his medical needs are met.Donations will go towards medical and physical needs, such as: durable medical equipment, wheelchair costs, medications to alleviate his constant pain and muscle spasms, and various physical therapies including PT, acupuncture, swimming, cycling and massage. The most important aspect for his progress will be his acute rehab at SCIFIT, an extremely rigorous, holistic physical therapy regimen specifically customized for each individual SCI patient’s particular needs for the fullest recovery possible.Below are links to some of the organizations that have helped to inform, educate, connect and inspire our father.We would like to share these resources for people in Northern California also affected by a SCI.NOR CAL SCI: https:  https://norcalsci.org/NO LIMITS COLLABORATIVE:  http://www.nolimitscollaborative.org/BORP:  http://www.borp.org/get-involved/SCIFIT:  http://sci-fit.org We appreciate all the love, support and positive vibes we’ve received and are so thankful for your donations.  We would also like thank all the Occupational and Physical Therapists; as well as, the doctors and nurses who have and continue to help our dad.Please share, so our dad’s story can reach as many people as possible and hopefully help a few people on the way! Klaes, Jack, and Gwen   ** Spinal strokes are very rare and account for less than two percent of all stroke. A very special thanks to Teresa Montgomery whose love is like a mighty river.

Due to the freak blizzard conditions the Boston area was experiencing, a snow layer prevented the fall from being fatal, but nevertheless Ryan was rushed to the hospital with a substantial list of injuries. Ryan suffered a skull fracture (above the ear) causing his brain to bleed in 3 separate places, 3 broken ribs, a collapsed lung, fractured right hip, and lacerated kidney and liver. A 2nd year Environmental Science major at Boston University, Ryan is a passionate, energetic, and hardworking individual. Described by many as “the life of the party,” Ryan truly embodies the Aloha Spirit. The type of upbeat character most people wish they’d meet earlier. Growing up in Honolulu, he embraced the local culture of community, where surfing, hiking, paddling, and weekends selling pineapples at the KCC Farmers Market kept him busy. There, and everywhere he ventured his infectious laugh, smile and goofy personality charmed everyone he encountered.In order to minimize the stress and anxiety on his family during such turbulent times, we ask for everyone's help to donate any amount to assist Ryan. Donations will go directly towards the extensive medical bills for his current and future procedures/tests, which already include multiple CAT scans, chest x-rays, and ICU costs. The second main hurdle that funds will cover are the rehabilitation costs, which doctors estimated could last up to a few months. While all this happens, Ryan’s single mother plans to remain by his bedside in Boston as long as she can, taking time off from her full-time job.  Ryan is a loved son, brother, cousin, nephew, and friend to to us all.

Medical,52,A Fresh Start for Bill ... HALT MS,https://www.gofundme.com/BillSparrow,"SCOTTDALE, PA","April 16, 2018","$60,000","$60,725","A Fresh Start for Bill ... HALT MSIntro:  HSCT Help & Your HelpAfter countless months of pressure, this extremely humble person finally let me put up this GoFundMe site. The reason why I’m reaching out to you is because he needs our help. Currently, there is NO cure for Multiple Sclerosis but there could be a way to HALT the progression and possibly repair the damage with a procedure called HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant). Sharing his MS disease has been a very difficult thing for Bill. He’s NEVER wanted to discuss this debilitating disease to anyone but there’s now … some real HOPE. Diagnosis and What IS MS?Bill was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1994, his form of MS is called Relapsing-Remitting. MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system and is an unpredictable condition that can be relatively benign or entirely disabling. There is NO cure for MS, it damages the nerves in the spinal cord and brain, this causes the exacerbations that lead to difficulties in walking, vision, cognitive problems and other physical difficulties.  More about MS: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/home/ovc-20131882 Today and Future:For the last 23 years, this disease has worsened for him. He has explained to me the exhaustive treatment options over his lifetime having MS; he’s been on countless FDA approved disease modifying drugs and advised by numerous MS Doctors, all while most of these Specialists and the MS Society have said,  “ There will be a cure SOON… just wait.” He’s been on extensive Paleo diets, physical fitness regimes, alternative vitamins, alternative therapies and alternative procedures … he is NOT getting better. Life is more difficult every year and it’s also more difficult for his family. The 20+ years of cumulative damage are now greatly affecting his ability to walk, balance, run a business, process thoughts, and just live life...let alone enjoy life. MS limits ALL of his life! He finds it difficult to imagine where he’ll be in 5, 10 and 20 years. He doesn’t want to deteriorate more but it WILL happen if the underlying disease is not stopped. MS is a persistent and relentless disease. Finding HSCT/Stem Cell Therapy: After years of researching, Bill found a procedure called HSCT. Finally something concrete…HSCT HALTS the disease for a significant number of people and it has been proven in FDA medical trials and international journals for over 15 years. In Scandinavia where MS is very prolific, as a part of their national medical care, HSCT is their standard protocol. Here are some studies looking at the efficacy of HSCT.  Click here  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22127896/  and a second study  https://bit.ly/2IV0iTC .Unfortunately, HSCT treatment in the US, Australia and other countries are in medical trials. Unlike standard US medical trials, these trials are almost always paid for by the patient, anywhere from $200-$500K for the treatment, on top of that there is a strict criteria to even get into the study.What is HSCT?HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant) is an established chemotherapy treatment demonstrated to be effective for halting disease progression in autoimmune diseases such as MS. It should not be confused with Regenerative embryonic or Fat derived stem cell therapy, which have yet to prove their long-term effectiveness for MS. HSCT “reboots” the immune system back to a point before the patient ever developed the ""markers"" for MS. The patient's body can then, over a period of months/years begin to repair/improve itself. Some of the awful symptoms that have the potential to improve are: balance, fatigue, heat sensivity, cognitive function, and the ability to just simply walk. Although HSCT procedure is NOT FDA approved in the US, it has been done for more than 10 years in clinical trials at Northwestern Hospital in Chicago and many other hospitals around the country. These trials have shown a 90% disease stoppage success rate. These ongoing clinical trials in the US are only for qualifying patients. In countries like Canada, Mexico, Russia, Germany and Israel to name a few, the qualification for patients is broader and although the success rates aren't at the 90% level, they do far exceed the rates of current treatments used in the US.Every legitimate medical treatment available today was at one time previously not FDA approved. However, HSCT itself IS an FDA approved medical treatment for cancer and has been performed millions of times since 1967. It simply isn't currently FDA approved for the indication of an autoimmune disease, but it WILL be eventually. It just takes time for the slow-moving wheels of medicine + Government bureaucracy to complete this approval process but make no mistake about it. . . . just because HSCT is not approved on paper for autoimmune diseases does not mean that it doesn't work. The data are crystal clear today; HSCT is the most effective legitimate medical intervention so far discovered to completely and durably HALT autoimmune diseases like MS. It is not necessary for treatment to be ""approved"" to show this….. www.healthline.com/health-news/ms-patients-who-received-stem-cell-transplants-still-in-remission-010715%2523modal-close or this 60 Minutes newscast ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0hekaFdmD0&feature=youtu.be.If you only watch one video/click any hot spot on this site, please go to this site below. This is a newscast from the BBC just published on March 19th, 2018; it IS proof of ALL the studies for over a decade … HSCT does HALT Multiple Sclerosis.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFyByMiwNNg&feature=youtu.be .Why Treatment at Clínica Ruiz in Mexico:Other countries have clinics currently treating MS with HSCT, since Bill was not accepted at the Northwestern Chicago study (Northwestern has a very narrow acceptance criteria) and because the cost there is approximately $200K, he has applied and was just approved to be treated at Clínica Ruiz in Mexico this summer. Clínica Ruiz is the largest patient volume autoimmune disease HSCT treatment center in the world. Dr. Ruiz Argüelles and Dr. Gómez-Almaguer have performed more than 2500 HSCT procedures during more than 20 years, out of which over 700 have been for MS. Their transplant related mortality is 0.22%, among the safest treatment records in the world. Positive results have been achieved in over 78% of the patients transplanted at Clínica Ruiz.Dr. Guillermo José Ruiz, namesake of this clinic, studied Internal Medicine and Hematology in Mexico and proceeded on to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN for his Post-doctoral research and training. As a result of the academic activity stemming from this program, he was elected Mayo Clinic’s distinguished Alumnus and elected Master of the American College of Physicians in 2013. More Information go to Clínica Ruiz’s site:  http://www.hsctmexico.com The Procedure/Recovery & Cost of Treatment :The procedure is intense; 4-6 weeks in the hospital, where T-cells (stem cells) will be harvested from his own bone marrow. He will then undergo a chemotherapy procedure to wipe out the immune system and the memory of MS. After a period of isolation, those T-cells will be reintroduced into the body. The new cells will migrate back to the bone marrow and eventually establish a new immune system that is less likely to attack the central nervous system, therefore HALTING the progression of MS; essentially its like a “FRESH START!”Here is where Bill NEEDS OUR HELP.  Unfortunately, nothing is covered by insurance. The procedure will cost $60,000, these funds would cover the cost of the treatment, travel to Mexico and a 24/7 trained out-patient staff during his time in Mexico. Bill will be there for approximately 4-6 weeks depending on various stages of the protocol and on his immune systems recovery. He will update the GoFundMe site regularly  with his progress. Appreciation:That big hearted person is still there but this disease has taken away:   The Rock Climber,  The Kayaker, The Explorer and most importantly … A Part of that Person whose Treasured things in LIFE are his FAMILY and FRIENDS.With HSCT there is finally some HOPE. The sooner HSCT is performed, the sooner this progression STOPS!~ Walking is man’s best medicine. HippocratesYOU CAN HELP BILL …1.  GIVE whatever you can.

Medical,53,Help Beth Beat ALS!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-beth-beat-als,"LONG BEACH, NY","June 25, 2018","$100,000","$32,877","Just months before Beth’s 57th birthday, she received a heart wrenching diagnosis. After months of countless doctor appointments, frustration and confusion about why her leg wasn’t working properly, she was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, well known for as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s Disease.  In a very short 6-month period, Beth went from a healthy hard working math teacher, to a strong and hopeful woman fighting a serious disease. ALS is a disease of the parts of the nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. In ALS, motor neurons (nerve cells that control muscle cells) are gradually lost. As these motor neurons are lost, the muscles they control become weak and then nonfunctional. A number of strategies and approaches are being tested around the world, both in the laboratory and in human clinical trials. One of the most significant breakthroughs in the last decade has been the discovery of a number of genes that, when flawed, cause ALS.  In late 2017, Beth took an awful fall while playing her beloved sport of tennis (yes this super woman managed to play tennis every Wednesday with her girlfriends). She was badly bruised and decided to take a little break from the sport as she healed. Not too much later she started experiencing fatigue, lack of mobility and twinges in her feet. Walking short distances had become slightly difficult for her and Beth was starting to get concerned.  After going to the orthopedist and having numerous x-rays taken, she was diagnosed with Spinal Stenosis.  Beth began physical therapy but there was no improvement and was getting worse. She continued with this diagnosis and saw a specialist in Manhattan who had much acclaim with treating patients who had spinal stenosis.  She received a cortisone injection, however, again, there were no improvements. Beth's fears heightened, but being such a strong, prideful woman she hardly complained.  She expressed that she had an awful feeling that she may have MS but tried not to think along those lines.Winter recess was now around the corner and her walking difficulties became more pronounced.  Less than a half a block walk was extremely hard for her and this vivacious woman was having a tough time. It seemed to all be happening so fast.Fast forwarding slightly, Beth was now seeing neurologists and other doctors to see if an alternate diagnosis could be found.  Beth was then diagnosed with ALS.  This disease has moved quickly and she is now in rehab.  Her beautiful and strong family have one goal in mind and that is to get her overseas for a special treatment that has been showing hope for this dreadful disease. Beth is the sweetest, kind-hearted and most hard working mother, friend and women anyone could ask for. She has dedicated her early years to the garment industry and 20+ years to devoting her days to teaching hundreds of kids in Brooklyn, the complicated world of mathematics. Her students, parents and colleagues adore her and has always brought nothing short of smiles, positivity and friendship to her work environment. Beyond her work life, she is a magnificent wife, mother and friend. She has three beautiful children and a loving husband, Ron fighting through each day with her. Her caring, nurturing and loving personality has created a strong foundation for her family and a warm environment for success. But now, Beth needs our help. In addition to the prayers and well wishes, Beth needs financial support to assistant with significant medical expenses, including adaptive living devices, rehab, home care and medical treatments. As you can see, this is a tragic situation. Your funds will directly support Beth’s treatment, alleviate the financial burden of Beth being unable to work, and to assist with the ongoing medical costs that are yet to come. Please share this page to everyone – all the support helps!

I’m the oldest child(21) of John and Jennifer Dedmon. I started this GoFundMe with a heavy heart because my mother and father were sadly involved in an ATV accident over the Father’s Day Weekend and were admitted to the ICU in Utah Valley Hospital.John and Jen and the entire family from Las Vegas were celebrating this Father’s Day Weekend at Yuba Lake State Park. On Saturday, June 16, John and Jen went out on an ATV ride. While out on the ATV there was an accident and they were thrown from the ATV and sustained serious injuries. Shortly after they were rushed to the closest hospital via helicopter.My Mother, Jen, was admitted into the hospital with a broken ulna and radius in her left forearm, a fractured rib, a fractured pelvis, a few fractured vertebrae’s of the lower spine, and lacerations/road rash all over her body.My father, John, was admitted into the hospital with a severe head injury. He has multiple facial fractures around his left orbital and is currently in a coma. The doctors are not sure when he will wake up. Doctors ran tests and have found his brain activity is almost completely normal with the acception that they have identified the bleeding in his brain to be a very minor Subarachnoid Hemorrage(SAH), so they are sort of perplexed to why he hasn’t woken up yet... The road to recovery for this type of injury is a long and winding road, so John will need all the loving support of his friends and family to help him through this tough time.John and Jennifer are two loving souls, two warriors of light, who always do their best to create a better world, a better environment for themselves and everyone around them. They find their happiness in helping those around them find their happiness. Besides me, John and Jen also have an 18yr old son, 12yr old son, and 10yr old daughter whom they love unconditionally and support financially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. Unfortunately, my father is the family’s main source of income while my mother is a stay at home mom which causes a little hiccup in handling the finances due to the intensive care that both my mom and dad need, the surgeries, cat scans and MRI’s, air transportation to the hospital, and regrettably not having any health insurance. Any and all donations will be going towards our family to help with medical bills and any financial hardships due to my father not being able to work. Any amount helps. If you cannot donate, we still love you. My family and I just ask you pray for John and Jen and send them as much positive, healing energy as you can.Thank you and Namaste <3￼￼",231,1.9k,23,222,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The best family on earth I am sure of it - seriously they are amazing and I am SO LUCKY to call them MY family through marrying Bekah's mom's (Lisa) brother Dan. Bekah was not found until 5:30am, approximately 3 hours after hitting the power line and rolling around, managing to get herself off the hood of the car and out of the glass, where she then rolled around screaming in the grass and mud until someone found her on their morning run at 5am.  She quickly spun off the road and hit a power line pole head on.  She was ejected from the car (thank goodness because I don't think she'd be with us had she remained in the car because it is absolutely crushed).  God was with her for sure and she fought through because of her love for her family.  Some of the siblings went to the site of the accident and there was no blood.  Her lacertations were down to the bone and through muscle, but no blood at the scene, even though she was covered when she arrived at the hospital.  I told Lisa yesterday, if anyone doesn't believe in God, just tell them this story.Her hair was found on the pole. Her injuries are agonizingly tragic and include a fracture neck vertebrae, lacerations on her liver, lacerations on her leg in two places (almost to the bone) - all the way around her knee and a huge gash they couldn't even close during surgery yesterday right near that main artery in your leg, 5 broken ribs, a broken scapula, two strokes!!! (omgosh), and torn nerves and ligaments in her hand affecting the mobility of her two middle fingers at this point. Her arm was also completely severed and will need skin grafts and more surgeries.  All of her teeth were chipped and dental work will be expensive in the coming months once she's through the more life threatening tragedy.I know I am writing very candidly, and I don't mean to upset her friends, family, relatives or community.  But for everyone who shares this, it reaches many more people and I want them to understand the gravity of the accident.I am setting up this GoFundMe account because the family really really needs all the financial support they can get.  Bekah's dad just finished paying off the bills from his heart surgery two years ago and they support 7 children!!!, including a 2 year old who they fostered and then adopted.  Adoption runs through our family.  My goal is to raise $40,000 to cover her approximate medical costs (they have a very high out of pocket maximum because they have so many kids and do not work for large corporations).  We also need to raise money to pay for her rent while she moves back in with her parents for a while, the dental work which won't be covered and the list goes on, including her parents being out of work to take care of her, her car, etc.).The whole family really needs all the prayers and support they can get as they adjust their lives for a few months.  Bekah doesn't even realize at this point what all has happened  They are the most lovely family and I cherish them. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE find it in your HEARTS to help them financially and through prayer.  Remember, we are a VILLAGE and it sometimes takes a village to get through something as tragic as this.  Hug your loved ones and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help us raise this money so they don’t have to worry about how to manage and stress over all that and can focus on getting Bekah well and back to a new normal!!  If you aren't able to donate, please PRAY and SHARE this with your network!!!!  And tag anybody and everybody who knows Bekah and her family!I promise you, this money will go toward a wonderful family, who is near and dear to me, and many others who will share this on their facebook walls.  And TRUST me, the money is truly going to what they need.  They have tons of family and community support but we can't do this without raising money.  Karma and God will pay you back, ten fold.",393,2.3k,4,381,7 days,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He has been fighting with his insurance company to have them cover the treatment, literally since his  diagnosis and often in the middle of treatment.It's next to impossible for him to make any kind of a living.  As his friend I can't sit here and watch the man suffer, so I've put together this little go fund me to ask for help for Dan.  Anything would be of help, as little as $5 and much as... well you know cancer treatment charges, they're astronomical.  Then there's rent (he could be evicted soon)  food, transport, medical, it all adds up.  And it's all needed as soon as ossible.  .  I have set a goal of $30,000, although I'm sure the bills will far exceed that.The type of cancer Dan has is called “Double Hit” Lymphoma, which is a very rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma – which is already super aggressive. He is at Cedars Sinai because that is one of the few places in the world that has the required expertise on the double hit lymphoma . So if you could all do me a huge favor and help my friend Dan, I would be most grateful, and I know he would be too.Cancer can strike at any time and at any age, having friends who can help in an emergency is a wonderful thing.

He lives with his dad, Jason (an Airman and part of the Special Forces community at Fort Bragg), in Pinehurst, NC during the school year and spends time with his mom, Beth, and his brothers, Alec and Braxton, in Ohio during the summer. He loves to cook (he wants to become a chef!), hang out with friends, play video games, scuba dive, and get into trouble at his grandma's farm.This summer Brett was supposed to be preparing for his first year of high school. He was going to take drivers education, go camping, and take a trip to Florida with his dad and brothers. Instead, Brett has spent weeks in the hospital having numerous surgeries after being diagnosed with brain cancer - specifically, a Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). How it StartedBrett began having headaches this spring. His dad, Jason, took him to their doctor in North Carolina. The doctor thought the pain was from allergies and suggested an over the counter allergy medication.On June 4th2018, allergy medications in hand, Brett traveled to Ohio to spend time with his mom and brothers. Later that week, Brett began to struggle with nausea and his mother took him to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed him with an ear infection and Brett was given antibiotics as well as new allergy medication.A week later, Brett's mom took him and his brothers on a camping trip to Pennsylvania. During the trip Brett once again became nauseous. On June 10th, his mom took him to a hospital in Clearfield, PA where they gave him steroids for his ear infection along with an IV and then released him. Brett felt better and continued camping with his family.After returning from camping, Brett would still occasionally feel upset to his stomach, but the family thought it was from his ear infection. On June 22nd, Brett made the trip to Iowa to spend time with his grandpa. However, on June 23rd, Brett began vomiting uncontrollably and was rushed to University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital in Iowa City. When Brett Was DiagnosedAt Stead Family Children's Hospital, they conducted an MRI. Brett was kept in the hospital over the weekend while he and his family anxiously waited for the results. His parents were notified Brett had a mass on his brain and surgery to remove the brain tumor was scheduled.On June 26, Brett had surgery to remove the tumor. What was supposed to be a five-hour surgery turned into a terrifying thirteen-hour waiting game while surgeons tried to remove the brain tumor.A biopsy of the tumor was taken and a week later it was confirmed that Brett had a Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). What is a Grade IV Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)Glioblastoma Multiforme is an aggressive brain cancer that can cause nausea, vomiting, headaches, speech problems and even seizures. Surgery alone cannot remove the entirety of the tumor because glioblastoma grows on healthy brain tissue. This means chemotherapy, radiation, and other forms of aggressive treatment are needed to fight the tumor. Glioblastoma Multiforme is VERY rare in children. Brett's Treatment So FarBrett has had three surgeries:The first surgery took four hours. This surgery was to place an EVD (external ventricular drain) to drain brain fluid. This allowed enough pressure to be taken off his brain so the doctors could prepare for the surgery to remove the tumor.The second surgery was scheduled for five hours but ended up taking over thirteen hours. This surgery was to remove the brain tumor.The third surgery took five hours. This surgery was to place a permanent shunt (tube) that runs from Brett's brain to his stomach. This allows the excess brain fluid he is unable to absorb to drain into his stomach. What is NextBrett has now been transferred to Duke Medical Center in North Carolina. On July 19th, Brett and his dad met with the Duke Medical team (including neuro-oncology director and staff, neuro-surgery director and staff, and radiation director and staff) and discussed what his immediate treatment plan would be as well as the side effects, prospects, etc.Brett's first treatments will be a type of chemotherapy (Temozolomide) in pill form and radiation daily for six to seven weeks at Duke. The doctors have informed the family that this has about a 25% chance of working on Brett's glioblastoma. There will be more treatments after the initial chemo and radiation for approximately one year, but the doctors are hopeful that Brett will be able to return to normal activities after a few weeks post radiation. How You Can HelpAny donation size is helpful. Three $10 donations equal $30. That could be one less meal the family has to pay for.If you are unable to contribute monetarily you can share Brett's GoFundMe page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or even through text. GoFundMe believes ""Sharing your GoFundMe on Facebook can increase donations by 350%.""Don't have a social media account? Try talking to someone in person. GoFundMe predicts, ""a face to face ask is 34 times more effective than an email.""  The more people who hear about Brett's story means more donations. Every little bit helps! How Will the Funds Be UsedBrett's journey is just beginning. Instead of taking drivers ed with his friends Brett is going to start chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Instead of going to movies on the weekend or staying up all night playing video games he will be spending countless days, weeks, months, in and out of the hospital.The first round of treatment is going to last approximately one year with multiple trips and stays in the Durham area which will be extremely costly. For example, during Brett's first six to seven week chemo and radiation treatments the doctors said Brett would not be able to handle the three to four hours every day it would take to travel for his treatments. His dad has found lodging close to the hospital that could hold the family, but it will cost approximately $4,000 for the first six weeks. That is just a place to stay, that does not include meals.His dad is also getting an in-home tutor for Brett so he will not fall behind when he is too ill to go to school.  Because Brett's mom and brothers live in Ohio, there will be numerous travel costs. Road trip costs include money for gas, food, and hotel. That doesn't take into consideration any emergency trips when the family will have to pay for last minute airline tickets. The closest major airports to his mom's home in Ohio is Detroit, MI or Cleveland, OH. The nearest major airport to Duke Medical Center and Brett's home in Pinehurst is Raleigh, NC.  Last minute airfare for three people (Brett's mom and two brothers) from Detroit to Raleigh is approximately $1500. That is a conservative quote.Brett's mother will also have to take unpaid days off of work to travel to see her son. And when his brothers are unable to make the trip the family will need to find childcare. Help Brett and His Family!While some of the costs may be small (a tank of gas may cost less than $50) everything adds up. Brett's family shouldn't have to worry if they can afford a last minute flight for an emergency procedure or be concerned about how much debt they will accrue living near the hospital while Brett has treatments. By supporting Brett's GoFundMe you're helping Brett and his family concentrate on beating cancer instead of agonizing over their bank account.

We have Medishare for insurance. The surgeon is accepting them as ""in network"" and will process billing after surgery. The hospital wants us to pay their portion and the anesthesiologist up front before confirming and moving forward. Medishare's policy is to not pay upfront (I don't blame them and understand). Medishare is going to contact the hospital and see if they can convince them to make an exception. We are currently sitting with an up front cash payment of $59010 which needs to be paid imediately. They are giving us a 50% discount. There is an urgency because every week that goes by greater symptoms and problems develope for Jill. Whats going on with Jill:My wife Jill Salter, has a Pineal gland cyst that has to be removed. November 2016 she started having dizziness and struggled with remembering things. We weren't sure what was going on but kept an eye on the symptoms that would come and go. March 2017 Jill had symptoms that resembled a stroke. We took her to Shands ER where they ran EKG, Cat scan, and other tests. They told her she had vertigo. Our family doctor sent her for an MRI. The results came back ""clear"". However the symptoms became frequent and resembled seizures, happening every week or two and left her with several days recovery each time. In March of 2018 she started having bad ""seizure"" episodes that would last up to four hours and no less that one hour but the residual effects would last for days. She would have slurred speach, couldn't answer basic questions, slowed motor skills and extreme dizziness. We took her in imediately for another MRI where we were informed a cyst they previously found had grown 40% in one year. Since then what we thought were seizures have been identified as pressure on the brain and what happens is the brain shuts down till it can cope again. These cysts can also cause hearing and vision loss which she has recently started experiencing. She now has these pressure episodes on average once a day lasting one to four hours. Jill has been unable to work for  over a year. Performing basic household tasks can be a major challenge as well. The surgeon Dr Dong Kim in Houston has some great info and an impeccable track record in dealing with this issue. When he met Jill he felt she was an extreme case, most people have episodes lasting one to ten minutes. The reality is these episodes are a result of to much pressure on the brain Wich can end up having permanent effects. With this surgery, Dr Kim has had 100% positive results varying from restoration of quality of life to full restoration.Here's a link to understand the issue and surgery: http://neuro.memorialhermann.org/pineal-cysts/Medishare works by submitting a bill and is paid by a pool of resources donated by it's members. Someone asked me ""what happens if Medishare pays, where do these funds go?"" These funds will pay for this medical bill and any overages will go back into the Medishare pool so other people who have life changing issues will have confidence that your help has granted them another chance at life.We have peace through all this.  Our faith is that God will provide. While we don't understand it at we know He is good and His mercy endures forever. Thankfor your help! Cory & Jill Salter",160,1.4k,4,192,1 month,7 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,54,Reggie Recovery  Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/reggie-recovery-fund,"Beverly Hills, CA","March 7, 2018","$100,000","$32,546","Last year on April 12, 2017, beautiful wife Gervel Sampson received that phone call every spouse dreads. It is a phone call that no one can every really prepare themselves.  It was a call that dramatically changed Gervel and her children’s life forever. Her incredible loving and giving husband, Dr.  Reginald Sampson (Reggie) suffered a massive stroke including hemorrhaging in the brain. He was paralyzed on the entire left side and loss the ability to speak.  He also suffered Congestive Heart Failure, Pneumonia along with other subsequent complications.This catastrophic event left Gervel, Amani and Reggie Jr. emotionally devastated and grief stricken. There were so many unanswered questions that went through their minds. “What is going to happen to my husband that I love and adore?” “What is going to happen to my daddy?” They came together as a family to use all resources to help #ReggieRecover. Reggie spent the last 10 months in hospital care fighting for his life with his beautiful wife and children along by his side never missing one step. No one could ever imagine Reggie would remain in the hospital for 321 days!Family is everything to the Sampson Family. Reggie, the patriarch has been the provider, the loving husband and father and an extraordinary physician.  To witness Gervel and his children respond with so much enduring love and strength to be an advocate for his care brings tears of hope.  Amani  came home to assist with  her daddy's medical practice  and Reggie Jr. dropped out of college to take care of his mother and his daddy.Reggie was discharged on February 27, 2018 from the hospital and is at home now but his recovery continues. Although he is happy to be home with his family, his journey to recovery will be long, arduous and expensive. Reggie’s fighting spirit is inspirational.  Through the amazing grace of his loving wife and children, he is determined to get better.The medical expenditures far exceeded insurance reimbursements not to mention insurance denial of payments (not covered).  Medical (Medicare) insurance will only provide limited resources and reimbursements. It is up to his wife, Gervel and his children to take care of him 24/7. He will need home healthcare, extensive physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, medication, medical supplies, follow up physician visits and medical transport.The Sampson family is blessed with so many incredible AMAZING friends, family, patients and acquaintances that are looking for a way to help Reggie, Gervel, Amani, and Reggie Jr. with his long-term continuum care. Go Fund Me is now available for all of us (it takes a village) to pull additional resources to help Reggie with his care and for his loving family. We all want Reggie to get better soon!!!!! A man that has touched and given  much to so many people, patients and the medical community deserves a fighting chance.  All donations and support are sincerely appreciated with unconditional love.   Thank youPlease follow Reggie , Gervel and Family Love Story Album on  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gervel.jonessampson/media_set?set=a.10213818885124793.1073741961.1187261410&type=3&pnref=lhc#ReggieRecover",221,859,2,221,5 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

This little child had endured so much in his short lifetime.  He has spent most of his life in a FL hospital but, it has become abundantly clear the hospital is not able to care for his special needs any longer. Boston Children’s Hospital has agreed to take on Jordan’s very special case. Jordan will be airlifted to BCH and start his new journey there but, his family is struggling with the already tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills that have accrued. We are hoping to raise enough money to pay for Jordan’s journey to BCH as well as help his family move to Boston for a short time. Please consider donating to Jordan and his family so he may start a new life in Boston. ❤️Here is the SHORT version of his long story...With no prior indications of any issues in utero, at birth Jordan was diagnosed with cleft soft palate, atrial septal defect, heart murmur, hypotonia, jaundice, sepsis, pelvocaliectasis, hypomagnesemia, hypospadias, micrognathia, retronathia, recessed tounge, airway obstruction, severe GERD, respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonic stenosis, anemia, dialed kidneys, apnea, bradycardia and failure to thrive. Shortly after birth he was diagnosed with Pierre Robin Sequence, a congenital condition of facial abnormalities. PRS is a sequence or chain of certain developmental malformations. The main features are cleft palate, micrognathia, (abnormal positioning of the jaw), retrognathia and glossoptosis (airway obstruction caused by backwards displacement of the tongue). This combination of features typically lead to difficulty breathing and feeding issues. Many months later he was also diagnosed with horizontal nystagmus and conductive hearing loss due to fluid in his ears from the cleft palate. He has had to have bilateral PET tubes placed in both ears and replaced during the time of some of his surgeries. He was also diagnosed with hypoplasia on the left thumb and some neurological issues have been suspected but yet to be diagnosed. Some issues from birth have since resolved or improved over time (kidney, pulmonary, some heart and some facial feature issues). He has been hospitalized the good majority of his short life, and has underwent 10 surgeries so far resulting in many developmental delays, brachycephaly and additional feeding and swallowing regressions. Between countless ER visits and hospital admissions, his time at home was mostly filled with therapies (Feeding/speech, OT & PT) and his drs appointments with his many specialists. Since birth he has struggled with feeding, swallowing, breathing, choking, severe reflux, vomiting and failure to thrive. He has had to have several different types of feeding tubes placed and replaced to assist with nutrition. He has had many NG tubes and G tubes placed and replaced. He has had central lines and broviacs to provide emergency nutrients when feeding was not possible and to supplement feeding during the FTT time. He has also had GJ tubes placed and replaced and more recently ND tubes also placed and replaced, all of which have not been successful in one way or the other. He has had to have some major emergency surgeries to correct the undiscovered malrotation and volvulus discovered only during surgery. He also developed adhesions as a result and needed additional emergency surgery. He has had to deal with several complications from multiple surgeries, many infections and lots of still unresolved GI issues. Also during this current admission they have discovered some additional abnormalities in his stomach and duodenum in his GI tract. After 3 months of being hospitalized, he is currently only receiving nutrition through the broviac catheter leading directly into the heart. He has not been able to feed successfully after the last few major abdominal surgeries.Further genetic abnormalities have been suspected but have only in the very recent been discovered. A super rare DNA change has been found and located in the p part of chromosome 19. Inside chromosome 19p13.2, there is a new variant in the SMRCA4 gene. This is a super new, super rare finding which there is no information available yet for. He is only 1 of 5 in the world who have been diagnosed with this genetic mutation. There are no medical publishings and very limited studies conducted. It is believed that he is the only one in the US with this finding. What this all means to Jordan and his future is still unknown but may be related to many of his struggles. He has come a very long way but has a long road ahead of him. However even with all these issues he’s the best boy you’ll ever meet. He will sweep you off your feet and dive right into to your heart with his sweetness, good looks and charm. No matter what he goes through he always has a big smile on his face. We love Jordan and his parents, Pete and Ena, so much and we just want to see this little boy get a fighting chance! -Bonnie & Bryon",241,1.4k,6,240,5 months,3 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

Like many families, we have asked that question time-and-time again since we learned that Tony was diagnosed with stage 4 Lung Cancer. Cancer does not care that Tony represents what is best in our humanity: because cancer is blind, because cancer has no empathy.So cancer has decided to try and take Tony from us, from this world, a truly special soul.  We as Tony’s family and friends are asking all who can, to help us fight cancer and to prolong a souls life. In asking this we also understand you will ask ""Why this one man?"" – ""why Tony Lake.""  We do not write these words lightly, nor take for granted the weight of categorizing Tony as a ""truly special soul."" But we must answer the ""why"" for each of you to give.First Tony falls into the category of those who choose kindness… who choose to light the world with understanding, generosity, patience and goodness, even though his younger days were filled with darkness. As a child who incurred the wrath of an alcoholic and loss of a brother, he decided to protect those around him, regardless of what that meant for him.Tony then chose to serve his country, and it was there as a Navy Sea Bee that his foundation as a union member in LIUNA and his talent in all phases of construction was nurtured. After serving, Tony strapped his meager belongings to his motorcycle and drove from the west coast to the east coast. There he married the love of his life, a single mom with two kids – both who easily called him ""dad."" Two more kids and a home were added on a single income of a construction worker; an income that would also support the care of two critically ill parents. An avid mountain biker, Tony thought he had injured his ribs in a fall. Instead the cancer gave him an inoperable tumor that grew to crack two ribs. Inside the lung the cancer also sits and waits. Traditional treatments have slightly reduced the larger tumor, but without targeted and new treatments, Tony’s life expectancy is 6 months. Insurance will not cover these prolonging treatments.While not of retirement age he will soon be forced to retire on a limited income, one that cannot pay for any new treatments much less continue with his present treatments. As his family we want more for Tony, because he has given so much to so many. Why should you decide to help this one man? Because the world is truly a better place with Tony in it.Thank you.",193,548,10,196,1 month,21 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Battling an advanced form of cancer is challenging in any circumstance, but in Venezuela, a country suffering a widespread humanitarian crisis, it can feel impossible.I support myself and my 5 year-old daughter illustrating children’s books. Venezuela’s runaway hyperinflation, has cut my income to less than USD $20 a month. For this same reason, my insurance only pays USD $15 for my cancer treatment.The challengesFor years, Venezuela has made international headlines for its severe food and medicine shortages. We are currently experiencing the highest inflation rates in the world and a crisis with no end in sight.Millions have fled the country, seeking refuge abroad. I chose to stay in Venezuela to care for my mother, and protect my family’s small dairy farm. Even if I find the resources to pay for treatment, the life-saving immunotherapy drugs I need aren’t available in Venezuela.

Soy madre de una niña de apenas cinco añitos, a quién mantengo con mis ingresos como ilustradora de cuentos para niños.Superar un cáncer y pagar los gastos de un tratamiento tan costoso es una proeza en cualquier país, pero en la Venezuela de hoy, sumergida en una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes en su historia, la lucha es mucho más cuesta arriba.Debido a la hiperinflación en Venezuela, la más alta del mundo, y a la aberración en los controles de cambio, mis ingresos equivalen apenas a menos de $20 dólares al mes. Mi seguro sólo cubre unos $15 dólares para gastos médicos. Enfermarse en Venezuela cuesta la vida En Venezuela, la escasez crónica de comida y medicinas cobra vidas a diario. Millones de Venezolanos se han visto obligados a abandonar el país en busca de protección y una vida digna. Decidí quedarme en mi país para cuidar de mi madre, y proteger nuestra pequeña granja familiar en Los Andes, que se ha visto amenazada por invasores.Incluso si tuviese los recursos económicos para pagar mi tratamiento, los medicamentos que necesito para la inmunoterapia que me salvaría la vida no están disponibles en Venezuela. Para recibir el tratamiento, tendría que importarlos o trasladarme a otro país, lo que podría añadir cientos de miles de dólares al costo de mi tratamiento. A nadie le gusta pedir dinero a sus amigos y familiares, pero no tengo ninguna otra opción, ya que simplemente no tengo los recursos para pagar los costos yo misma.Tengo sólo 44 años, mi mayor anhelo es proteger a mi hija Iroma y verla crecer. No permitiré que el cáncer o la crisis de Venezuela me de por vencida. Te pido por favor que me ayudes a luchar contra esta enfermedad y mis circunstancias.  Las donaciones serán utilizadas para pagar por los medicamentos, cirugías y demás gastos médicos. Cualquier monto es bienvenido y ayuda a llegar a nuestra meta de $50 mil dólares.  Cada ayuda es un regalo que significa el mundo para mi.  Gracias por tu ayuda y compasión,  Laura-------私はラウラといいます。ベネズエラで、私の保険では１５ドルしか出ないのですが、私の治 療にかかる医療費は、５万ドル以上です。診断されたガンは、ステージ3の悪性黒色腫で、皮膚がんの中で、 一番致死的な種類です。ステージ３のガンと戦うことは、どこでも辛いことですが、人道上 の危機にあるベネズエラの場合、本当に、それは無理に思えます。今、絵本のイラストを描く仕事で、自分と５歳の娘の生活費を稼い でいますが、ハイパーインフレーションの影響で、今の月給は、約 ２０ドルしか貰えません。実は、お金が完全に用意できても、それだけで治すことはできませ ん。必要な免疫療法薬物は、ベネズエラでは販売していないため、 外国で探すことが必要になります。親戚や友達、知り合いの皆に、こういうお願いすることは、自分に とって物凄く大変なことですが、自分の力だけでは、医療費を絶対 に支払うことが出来ません。44歳のお母さんとして、娘のイロマちゃんを立派な女性になるま で、必ず一緒にいたいんです。私は、 ガンやベネズエラの金融危機に、絶対に負けたくない！どうか助けてください、この大変な状態を乗り越えて、私は、病気 に打ち勝ちたい。皆の寄付で、イタリアのミラノで治療が受けられる可能性がありま すが、ビザを取るためには、 医療費をちゃんと支払えることを確認し、約束するための書類が必 要となります。皆の協力は、何よりも宝物です。みんなを愛しています。本当にあ りがとうございます。ラウラ---------

Medical,55,Help Nathan Dyer & Family!,https://www.gofundme.com/help-nathan-and-family,"MADISON, WI","April 26, 2018","$100,000","$32,312","Hi everyone,My little brother, Nathan Dyer, had the incredible opportunity to travel with my cousin to Morocco while they visited her husband's family. He was having an amazing time riding camels and exploring - all while wearing a replica Indiana Jones hat!About two weeks in, Nathan came down with symptoms that looked like traveler's sickness. My cousins took him to see a doctor where he was hydrated and given some antibiotics. Days later, he still was not improving - in fact, he was getting worse. He was so weak that he could not even stand. My cousins took him to a hospital where he became worse and worse, until he was in a coma-like state.My mom started working with his traveler's insurance to get him back to the States for better treatment, but he was not stable enough to move that far. It was ultimately decided that he would be flown to Paris, France. Luckily, his traveler's insurance covered my mom's flight to Paris and she was there to meet him when he arrived. The French medical staff told her that he had not been properly treated while in Morocco. Nathan had a bacterial infection, was on a ventilator, was close to kidney failure, and had had at least one seizure.  His kidneys are functioning better now, but he has had another seizure. He was moved to another hospital in Paris to be treated by a specialist, but his initial diagnosis was found to be incorrect. He is still only minimally conscious and we know that the road to recovery is going to be a long one.My family is hard-working and we do not have much. While our focus is on Nathan, we cannot help but worry about how we are going to pay for his international healthcare after his traveler's insurance stops covering care. Nathan and my mom are on BadgerCare, which does not cover healthcare internationally. Nathan was very lucky to be included in my cousin's travel plans and budget and, as a hard worker himself, was able to pay for his plane ticket to Morocco with his own savings from working at the Lake Geneva Cruise Line. My mom works for hourly wages and is currently not working as she is with Nathan in France - we have no money coming in. I am a graduate student and do not have much to begin with. I am leaving to see my little brother soon, which means that I won't be working either.We need a lot of support. Your donation will help my family with...-Plane tickets-Lodging-Food-Medical expenses-To help us stay on our feet after Nathan gets better and my family has not been workingWe have already accumulated $4,200 worth of medical expenses from Nathan's care in Morocco and nearly $26,000 worth of medical expenses from Nathan's current hospital in Paris; this does not include the first hospital that he was treated at in Paris and the additional costs that build up with each passing day. While news sources are emphasizing our efforts to bring Nathan back to the United States as soon as possible, he does not have a diagnosis. Because we do not know what is causing his illness yet, we do not know if he is stable or what other complications may arise if he tries to fly right away. We do not know when he will be able to fly the distance from France to Wisconsin.  This GoFundMe will be used to address all of the above listed costs as they arise - not just the potential full cost of an air ambulance. Nathan is a smart, talented guy with the driest sense of humor and a lot of fight in him. He deserved to have the adventure of a lifetime in Morocco.

A family who is filled with such love and hope during their difficult journey, that they are inspiring everyone they meet. Their baby boy needs your help today…Meet Jason Jagdeo and Marissa Naidoo-Jagdeo…loving parents of Baby Michael Anthony Jagdeo (their little Hero aka “Miracle Mikey”).    Background: On November 2nd, 2015, Jason and Marissa’s lives changed forever; their beautiful angel, Michael Anthony Jagdeo, was born. Unfortunately, his birth was so traumatic that it became life-threatening to both mommy and baby. By nothing short of a miracle, they both survived. We’ve affectionately nicknamed him our “Miracle Mikey”.Mikey was kept in NICU for 3 weeks…fighting for his life. He had suffered brain damage, so extensive that doctors predicted that he would never walk or talk; this news devastated his parents, but they never gave up hope! They have faith that Mikey will defy all odds.On his second day of life, Mikey’s seizures began … and evolved over time, into a rare form of epilepsy, West Syndrome, resulting in hundreds of daily seizures. They were told that there is no cure and coupled with Mikey’s extensive brain damage, his prognosis was extremely poor. Yet, his parents never gave up hope. Together with a team of doctors, they cycled through many different combinations of medicines until they found a regime which drastically reduced his seizures! Doctors were amazed! Another miracle! However, because of the extent of his brain damage, doctors predict that his seizures would continue to evolve over his lifetime…and now, they have begun to evolve. Although heartbroken, his parents have faith that Mikey’s healing is on the way! They embody this quote: “where there is great love…there are always miracles.” There is no doubt that because of their unwavering love, faith and devotion, Mikey will continue to defy all odds.How you can help:                                                                                              For the first time, in a long time, this beautiful family has been given some hope. The specialists have ruled out surgery as an option because Mikey’s brain damage is too widespread. They have instead recommended Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy to improve his quality of life and to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, his seizures. Since Mikey continues to defy all odds, his family believes that another miracle is in the making. To see Mikey walk, talk, run and play one day would be the greatest blessing ever.However, to avoid any untoward adverse effects as a result of Mikey’s extensive brain injury and the complex, evolving nature of his seizure disorder, this specialized treatment would have to be accessed out of country, under the careful guidance of a specialist with more than 30 years experience in treating children with seizure disorders.We would need to raise at least US$89,000.00 to make Mikey’s dream a reality. Through your kindness today, we can do this!Mikey is a little hero who bravely fights his battles every day and lights up the world with his love! He is an angel on this earth, whose eyes radiate hope and determination. He just needs a little help from you right now to get him to his breakthrough.His parents are two of the most beautiful souls you will ever meet. Despite their difficult journey, they are uplifting and inspiring everyone with their love, faith and joy! To see them in tears shatters your heart to pieces. They are blessings to others; let us bless them in return with our kindness. They wish to do everything possible for Mikey because they have faith that he will do the impossible…as he has done thus far! His story is truly a miracle in motion…..",290,2.0k,5,284,2 months,8 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,55,For Amy(Kennel)Lott Cancer Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/amykennellott,"PORTLAND, OR","June 25, 2018","$70,000","$32,230","￼￼￼Shortly after Mother's Day, our family was rocked by the news that Amy was diagnosed with aggressive Stage 4 Uterine Cancer that had spread to the lining of her abdomen. Two weeks later she was in Chicago at Northwestern Hospital undergoing the removal of her uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and the omentum where tumors were found. The surgery was successful in removing everything more than 1 centimeter but we learned that there was a splattering of tiny spots of cancer scattered throughout her pelvic/abdominal area.  Her pathology report came back and after deep research and  many conversations with Gynecological Oncologists and Naturopathic Oncologists,  she and Mike faced the hard reality that the traditional route--- Surgery/High Dose Chemotherapy/ Radiation- has a very poor success rate.They were told that chemotherapy would not be curative. Chemo isn't as successful because this type of cancer has a high and rapid recurrence rate that can happen even before the body has recovered from the initial round of chemo.  This leaves patients who can't do more chemo with no treatment options to handle the recurrence.With this reality facing her, Amy and Mike, after much prayer, feel that traditional chemo is the wrong choice for her and have made the decision to seek Integrative Naturopathic treatment- that combines low dose chemo and immune boosting therapies to help her body become stronger. She and Mike will leave for a clinic near the US/Mexico border on July 19th. They expect to be at the clinic for 3 to 5 weeks and will then return with a plan she will continue at home. While the Naturopathic choice may seem bold to us at first, in reality she has made a very logical decision to reject traditional treatment. Our family is behind her decision 100% and believe that God has led her down this path for a reason. Since Amy's health insurance only covers the conventional chemo/radiation route, we are asking friends and family to help us raise money to make the financial side of this a little easier to bear so that Amy can focus on healing and strength to keep up with their two precious and energetic boys. The costs include time at the clinic, at home treatment costs, supplements, infusions, missed wages and travel.We ask you continue to pray for Mike, Amy, Evan and Andrew and for our entire family. Thanks to the power of your continued prayer, we have felt our initial devastation lift and the light of God's promises start shining through. Thank you for continuing to pray for healing, wisdom and lots of joy filled days as we embrace this detour with determination.[When you pray, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.— James 1:6]",181,1.1k,12,180,2 months,5 days ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,55,Help Nick fight Cancer!,https://www.gofundme.com/please-help-nick-fight-cancer,"RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, CA","June 18, 2018","$125,000","$32,218","Hi there! My name is Atianna and I am asking you to please help save my son Nick’s life! Nick was Diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma on May 24, 2018.Help Save ‘Super Nick’! We need you!I'm a Single Mom of Three Kids.Nick is a 4 year old little boy with two siblings; Jasmine 12 and David 7. My beautiful son, Nick, is the bravest and most amazing person I have ever known  in my life. His smile hardly ever seems to leave his face. His warm and silly personality has everyone falling head over heels for him. Our nurses never seem to forget him! Nurses visit our room from all floors of the hospital just to say hello, as he leaves a lasting impression with everyone. Choc hospital has named my sweet little boy, ‘Super Nick’ because of his continuous positive spirit and endless level of courage! Our nurses made a poster ‘Super Nicks Room’ and hung it on his hospital room door for everyone to see!Our story began in the most complex and confusing way.. Nick appeared perfectly healthy without any health issues prior to dropping him off to school and rushing to work one morning. It all started as a regular day at school for Nick.. Until he jumped from a little toddler slide while playing at school and hurt his ankle. When I picked him up from school that day, we rushed to our pediatrician and then to mission hospital for an X-ray.. no breaks or fractures were found...we were sent home. Strangely, Nicks pain did not improve with each passing day and instead traveled to his hip and thigh area. With numerous visits to the doctor, including an orthopedic specialist and repeated X-rays, we were told that it was an assumed pulled muscle that should heal with some time.Nicks pain was horrific, unexplainable and worrisome. I took my 4 year old baby boy to our pediatrician a handful of times, each time asking why the pain was traveling to different areas of his legs and back.. each time we were sent home without the right answer. We were distracted by the fall and by Nicks healthy weight, appetite and demeanor. Our pediatrician decided to get some blood tests taken from Nick.. One abnormal lab led us to CHOC children’s hospital Emergency Room, where we came in contact with a very special Doctor that said she would admit us and not let us leave until she got to the bottom of this. Nicks labs were taken again and had worsened from the last ones taken. The following day Nick had an emergency MRI and Catscan done under anesthesia. Soon the sky became dark as we were given the diagnosis of Stage IV High Risk neuroblastoma cancer on May 24, 2018. My world truly turned upside down. How could my innocent child be given a 66% chance of survival from Choc and 30% survival from the cancer association?  All these numbers and statistics gave me little hope, until one day I had decided that we would fight as though we were certain that Nick was the surviving and thriving number. Currently, my son is being treated at CHOC children’s hospital in Orange, California.Over the next year and a half we have a road map set by the oncology team at CHOC that includes three phases of aggressive treatment.  Nicky will endure 2 surgeries within the first phase of treatment which includes 6 rounds of of aggressive inpatient chemotherapy, the retrieval of stem cells from Nick that will be frozen and used to ‘save him’ after intense radiation and ongoing high doses of chemo in phase two of treatment.  Phase 2 of treatment will include 6 weeks of continuous inpatient stay for three cycles with 3 to 4 week breaks in between.. and finally, a stem cell transplant (using his own stem cells) during his Immunotherapy in phase 3 of treatment to ‘save him’ from the damage that radiation and chemo will cause. There is a hope for the possibility of more advanced treatment in Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital of N.Y. that is the one and only facility to offer cancer vaccines to protect patients from reoccurring cancer after treatment.Nick will be treated with 3F8, which is Memorial Sloan Kettering's proprietary antibody against GD2. It is an experimental medication waiting to be approved by the FDA. It is made only at Memorial Sloan Kettering and other hospitals don't have access to it at this time.Also, Memorial Sloan Kettering has a clinical trial ongoing for a vaccine therapy after GD2 therapy, but it is only available on trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering, CHOC doesn’t  have access to it. Memorial Sloan Kettering treatment is different than what most other centers are using as ‘standard of care’ for this type of rare and aggressive form of cancer. We would end up living in New York  periodically for 2 -3 months each time, getting rounds of radiation and numerous rounds of immune and antibody therapies.  I have been tirelessly searching for more options.  Through outreach to many doctors and organizations, Nick has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help Nick in his battle with Neuroblastoma cancer!Phase 2  of treatment for Nick, will consist of 6 weeks inpatient of radiation and chemo at a time, then home for a short while and back again with three rotations like this. If Nick survives then phase 3 of treatment begins, which is what we look forward to, Immuno therapy. The doctors explained that Nicks risks are, infertility, deafness, becoming cross eyed, severe pain from radiation, learning disabilities, relapse of cancer, new types of cancers that can be caused by the treatment, and much more. This is all an absolute nightmare. We pray that Nick will fight this cancer and win!! We will fight this battle with him! He is the strongest, bravest, funniest, most affectionate little boy in the world! Nick loves music, it makes him feel better. He receives music therapy at CHOC to cheer him up and heal his spirit. This picture was taken during Nicks first round of chemo just a week after we were diagnosed.Excited to be home and all together for the first day! Siblings were in deep heart ache to be separated during Nicks hospital stay. We had difficulty finding help to watch David and Jasmine during Nicks first round, which was a long 3 week stay. We hoped to have two weeks home together before returning to the hospital for round two of inpatient chemo but we had two emergency trips to the hospital for infections, fevers, hives and more, that unfortunately kept us away from home for almost all of the duration of our anticipated ‘home time’ together. This has been painful for all of us. Watching Nick suffer and being split apart from one another during our hospital stays, has left each of us broken.I had to stop working as soon as Nick was diagnosed, hospital expenses and bills are piling up. I am a single mother and have no idea how I will support my family with this horrible diagnosis and time that I must and will always spend at Nicks bedside. We are in a desperate need of financial resources to help sustain treatment, alternative medications and all expenses that this crisis has brought upon our family.The cost for alternative treatment is substantial, and the need to start is urgent!

In July 2018, she was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma. She started receiving treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital (MSK) in New York City starting July 11th.  She has since tested negative for presence of the disease in her bone marrow, an encouraging result. Willa’s doctor specializes in this disease and is walking the Pauletti family through each step of this process. Each day new tests are being done to see what treatments Willa's body will and will not tolerate, so the days are long for everyone involved. At this time, it is expected that treatment will last at least the next six-eight  months. Miss Willa is proving to be a real champ through all the poking, prodding, sometimes-scary procedures and being cooped up — not a preschooler's idea of a good time. Looking down the road, the Pauletti family is going to need lots of love and support in many forms to face this disease head on. There are a few tangible needs that will need to be taken care of right away, and many expenses the family will incur while seeking treatment for Willa in the coming months. What we've learned so far about the path ahead is that Willa's immune system is going to be fighting hard, so as she moves from the hospital to their home for her monthly chemotherapy treatments, increased and ongoing deep cleaning of the Pauletti's home, plus a hospital grade air purifier will be important. Frequent appointment trips to Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital for treatments brings the associated gas, parking, and tolls.  Heidi and Gregg have diligently stood watch at Willa's bedside for days now, and will continue to do so, taking respite at the Ronald McDonald House nearby in short bursts. So far, this has not incurred a cost, but  there is a maximum stay limitation which we anticipate meeting before treatment is complete for Willa. This campaign has been initiated to defray the cost of supporting the clean home environment Willa needs to heal and the ongoing unexpected costs of travel, childcare, lodging and equipment, the medical/ drug costs we are learning will not be covered, and other needs that the Pauletti family will have to get Willa the treatment  and care required. With time, more will become clear about how Willa's treatment plan will affect the family's lives with regard to missed work, etc. As we understand what else may be required, we will update this campaign to help offset the burden for the Pauletti's.Thank you for all your continued support and prayers for the Pauletti family. Anyone who has or knows children, knows how heart-wrenching this fight will be. Anyone who knows Heidi and Gregg Pauletti knows there are no stronger, more vigilant, more fiercely loving people to support Willa in her fight. Join us in standing behind them and showing your support as they bravely face this challenge head on.With Gratitude, Friends of The Pauletti FamilyTo learn more about Willa's journey:   https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/willapauletti",205,598,2,204,1 month,1 day ago,2 days,2018-09-03

Upon the procedure, just days later, the surgery revealed 3 dark spots in which the doctor biopsied. In less than 1 week, we received Casey’s diagnosis of stage 4, Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Casey, due to severe pain and inability to swallow, has lost 33 pounds in about 6 weeks. He’s been unable to work since November 2017. The local Cancer Institute proposed their method for this aggressive deadly cancer. It involved minimal chemotheropy AND TOTAL removal of Casey's tongue. Additionally he will receive heavy radical radiation, surgical addition of a permanent lifetime airway tube and a feeding tube.  The success rate of this method is 40% and life expectancy of only 3-5yrs. After frantically researching for a treatment with a more positive outcome, Casey and his family were directed to University of Chicago Medical Center. The Oncology team, after meeting Casey, projected hope. A 6 session plan of simotanious  chemotherapy and radiation for 5 days. He will receive 6 sessions of these 5 day treatments, one week on and one week off. Casey announced he is ready to fight and undergo the intense, painful treatment to try to save his tongue and his life. The Chicago Cancer team has started fighting Casey's deadly cancer 1 week after meeting in April 2018. Casey will undergo 10-12 weeks of ""In & Out"" treatment and quite a bit of time rehab and recovery. The family is working diligently, with help from the hospital and friends, to secure living quarters while he is relocated for treatment in Chicago. Donations will help with travel, medical treatments, therapies, and living expenses. Casey may not be able to work for 9 -12 months due to the treatments and therapies to help save his life. The family is struggling to pay Casey's medical and personal expenses which have been mounting since November 2017. With faith, hope and determination to support Casey's decision, we are reaching out to our communities for immediate support for this wonderful young man.",154,1.1k,4,152,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

For those of you that have been so kind to follow his journey over the past 3 years, he has been through more than any one person should ever have to endure. He has battled two severe back surgeries, a heart attack, 2 existing aneurisms near the heart, and now this. Chuck began a treatment plan to include extensive oral surgery, and 7 weeks of radiation 5x per week and Chemo 1x per week mid June. By God’s grace he has been given an 80%+ cure rate though the effects of the treatment have been quite debilitating and painful to say the least. We expect the road to recovery to be long and costly, and by default, a prolonged period of yet again, being without income. So many of you have reached out and asked how to help, and for this we can not begin to express our sincere gratitude. For this reason, please know that contributing to this fund will be extremely helpful to meet medical and living expenses that have accrued from the beginning and continue to grow. More important, your help will provide peace of the mind for Chuck to focus 100% of his available energy on overcoming this horrible disease.Please direct communication to Chase (EDWARDS.CEE@GMAIL.COM) or Jami (JL.EDWARDS@HOTMAIL.COM) as we attempt to allow Cheri also to focus 100% on caring for Chuck at this time.Anyone who knows Chuck, also then knows that he is the last to ask and first to offer 100% of himself for the benefit of those around him. For this reason, one can imagine that this is not an easy ask. From our family to yours, may you never have to experience these horrible events of life and if you do, may you also be blessed with the incredible family, friends and Father Above that have overwhelmed us with love to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Please join us in prayer through this time. Sincerely,The Edwards Family",157,1.0k,0,155,1 month,25 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

He welcomes them each morning by name and escorts them to their bus or carpool with a personal goodbye as well.

This was an unexpected and shocking discovery.  God’s hand and favor has been evident in the process from the beginning as the diagnosis was made quickly and the medical care has been initially covered by a local medical charity for those without insurance.  The overall prognosis is good, but it’s clear that the road to recovery ahead will not be an easy one.  He is looking at SIX MONTHS of being home for treatment and recovers. TWO MONTHS of AGGRESSIVE CHEMO & RADIATION,  and then FOUR MONTHS of RECOVERY and possible surgery.  The charity has limited resources, so there will be medical bills Jason and Gina will have to cover.  Jason brings in the family’s main source of income through the ministry, which he will be unable to do for at least 6 months. There will be MEDICAL BILLS &  LIVING EXPENSES that need to be covered ASAP since Jason has been home all of March and will MISS SIX MONTHS OF WORK. Jason and Gina have sacrificed so much and passionately poured out their lives for the Lord and countless people for over 20 years.  They have deeply touched so many of our hearts.  Now is a beautiful opportunity to give back to them in their time of great need, both through our prayers and our financial support.  Their faith through this process has been incredible and they are believing for a miracle and for God to receive much glory through this.  Let’s help carry them, surround them with love and support and believe with them for this miracle!"" Connie Wantling""It is with a burdened, but very hopeful, heart that I make this request of friends and family of Jason Lee Jones, my brother in law. Very recently he was diagnosed with throat cancer. For those that know him, you know that he is an extraordinary human being that has dedicated his life to God. The lives that Jason has touched and brought to God around the world is uncountable. His unending dedication and devotion to the Lord through his music and voice is his livelihood. That is why this disease, especially because of where it has afflicted him, is so crucial to hit head on and immediately with very aggressive radiation and chemotherapy. Jason is a strong man and very physically fit for his young age of 44. We know and believe that with your help he will be able to beat this disease with a full recovery to get him back on the road. Without insurance to cover the already increasing costs of unforeseen treatment, the next months are going to be difficult for him and his family. Your support during this time for Jason is going to allow him to focus on fighting and beating this disease without worrying about how he is going to be able to make ends meet for his family; his wife and two young children, since he will miss 6 MONTHS  of his traveling missionary & philanthropic work with The Godbreed & Iris Savannah . Even the smallest amount of financial support during this time will go a long way in helping the family. Please help us to give back to Jason and his family some of the love and support that they have so selflessly given of themselves through their dedication to the ministry over the past 20 + years. Even if you don’t have the means to help out financially, your love and prayers would be very well received. We appreciate every single one of you for all your love, gifts of time, prayer, love, or any creative support during this time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts and will keep you updated on his status. God is good.""Kory & Andrea Reeves, your brother-in-law & sister.""One of my dearest friends. My brother (truly, don’t mess). I remember the phone call. The news. The surprise. The lament. The sorrow. But, more than all,  the hope. And the joy of Jesus over my brother's life. In the midst of my fear and confusion about it all...the thing he says continually? “The devil messed with the wrong man. I’m going to preach Jesus even harder and stronger than ever before. Even if I lose my voice, I will still shout Jesus in my inner man.” So thankful to know him and his family. In the midst of a cancer diagnosis, he has a true John the Baptist message (tattooed, big bearded, wild eyed and all)...”prepare the way of the Lord”. Find friends who call you higher. Especially in the midst of trial. Find friends who call you higher. Support and love looks like something. Nobody can be prepared for this kind of news practically. Let’s rally together.

In the past year her diagnosis went from pregnancy-related fatigue to carpel-tunnel to an auto-immune disease from which she would recover and finally to ALS, a terminal disease with a life expectancy of 3-5 years.ALS destroys the nerve cells responsible for controlling your muscles, leaving your mind intact to perfectly understand what is happening to your body and to your loved ones as they are left in grief for the unlived dreams you leave behind and their complete inability to help.  Unfortunately, her family has been through this before with her grandfather, Bill, who passed away a year after being diagnosed with ALS in 2006.  He was a great man, extremely hard working, utterly devoted to his family, and robbed of his well earned retirement enjoying traveling and family with his wife and 4 grandchildren (whom he doted on).  He is missed.Although she hopes to participate in a clinical trial and has started medication in hopes of extending her time with Patrick and Scott, there are some immediate needs for modifying her home and purchasing adaptive aids.  In the future, her care needs will include home care, travel expenses, and setting up a fund for Patrick's education.If you are unable to give, please consider adding Angela to your prayer list and sharing her story with others.Thank you so much and God Bless,Angela's Familyp.s.  Angela really lived life.  She pursued her dreams and built up a large network of friends whom she loves.  She loved to watch KU basketball, ski, and be outdoors.  Below is a picture from one of her proudest moments, having reached the summit of a ""fourteener"" in Colorado.",240,1.1k,9,253,5 months,12 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

After undergoing an unsuccessful round of chemotherapy in Croatia, he came to Boston in search of second-line treatment. Within a week of being here, the doctors discovered that he was suffering from another life-threatening condition, heart-failure brought about by acute cardiomyopathy. In short, the first round of chemo didn’t kill the cancer, but it did manage to kill his heart. Soon thereafter he underwent heart surgery to implant an LVAD (mechanical heart) and spent months in the hospital.Unfortunately, because of his heart condition, he would not be able to receive any more chemotherapy, nor any of the more cutting-edge treatments (stem cell and bone marrow transplantations, CAR-T cell therapy, etc.) taking place at Dana Farber. All that was left was radiation, which he underwent in January and again in April.  Last week, he underwent a PET scan, which revealed that the radiation did not work. The tumor on his neck has not only grown back aggressively, but as well, the cancer has spread to his lungs. While we knew the news from this appointment would likely present additional challenges, no one was ready to hear that the end may be upon us.With no more ‘western’ options available, Brett is not giving up and is as determined as ever to beat this. He’s taking his fight back to Europe, where he has found several alternative health clinics in Slovenia and Switzerland, which specialize in bio-energy. Not only do these clinics bring forth their own costs (starting at approx 50K for treatment), but as well, Brett and his wife Masa have been invested full-time in his recovery. As such, we would like to help him raise some money that would go towards travel costs, treatment, pain management, and if nothing else, a little bit of comfort.",153,284,0,155,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Jessica has returned to work for the last month to preserve medical insurance for our family. This has been extremely mentally/physically taxing on her to juggle work/going to the NICU/going home to Juliana. Mike has been unable to work so he could help balance being at the NICU and taking care of important appointments for Brenden while Jessica is at work.   Each day, specialists are seeing Brenden, evaluating him and making decisions...the nature of Mike's work would make it impossible for him to be there and work simultaneously. Now, we have found out that our insurance will not cover everything that Brenden will need to go home. While some  equipment is covered, he will need back up equipment (and back up for the back ups)....and 24/7 skilled nursing at home, among other expected expenses. We also will need to move from our apartment and get a different car to best accommodate Brenden’s needs. It’s going to take awhile to get him home. He has at least another 3-4 more weeks in the NICU (if all goes well). Then, he will be going to a rehab facility where they can train us on how to best take care of him. He had a tracheostomy on 6/12/18 and is going to have a gtube/feeding tube surgery on 6/19/18. He will require a ventilator at home. We need to become experts in how to care for all of that. During this time, neither of us can work, as we need to be present and with Brenden each day to learn...the faster we are trained, the faster he can come home. We don't know how long this part will take. A summer without Mike's income, after all of these months of him being unable to work while living off of one income and so many unexpected expenses, will definitely put us into a crisis financially.Then, once he can come home, depending on when that is, Jessica may need to take some days off from work to get Brenden settled.  She has exhausted her ""CAR"" days (personal/sick in bank) and already borrowed 18 days that she needs to repay to the DOE.  She has 4 weeks left of FMLA that she could take, if needed (which would be unpaid).  


At this point, the level of care Brenden will need after he gets home and as he grows older is unknown.So many people have reached out and asked how they can help...so here is our request. If you can’t donate, we would appreciate it if you could keep Brenden in your continued thoughts and prayers.

After a lumpectomy and lymph node removal surgery in March, her pathology indicated her cancer had spread. She is currently enduring 20 rounds of chemo, which will be followed by further surgery, radiation and then 10 years of hormone therapy. (Shelby is encouraging ALL her female friends to get mammograms. Her cancer was found during her 10th annual mammogram/sonogram. Her mother, a BC survivor, was diagnosed at 41 and her aunt was diagnosed at 35. Luckily, Shelby found out that she does not carry the gene). The really good news is that Shelby’s prognosis is for a full recovery.

Unfortunately, her recent rounds of chemo have made it too difficult for her to work. She recently had no choice but to leave her job. We don’t see her being able to work again until next year.

After almost 10 years together, you can imagine that Shelby’s cancer diagnosis has been such a blow to our family. We are all fighting and amazingly, Shelby is in good spirits most of the time! But with this sudden change of events we cannot survive on just one income. It’s quite hard for me to admit, but we have to ask for help. These times have shown me that I cannot do this alone. We are so blessed to have some great people surrounding us with love, prayers and support; however we can’t make it through without further assistance.

·     Medical bills

·     Emery’s daycare tuition

·     Childcare and healthcare during Shelby 2nd surgical recovery

·     Grocery delivery


I’m hoping we can all come together some way and make a big difference. Every penny counts and we appreciate each one!

Neha is a sweet, smart, and funny 13-year old girl whose body is deteriorating while her mind remains perfectly intact. Her increasingly limited mobility poses a challenge to her loving parents’ ability to serve as caretakers and the demands of her disease have introduced extreme financial stress into their lives. Neha is in immediate need of critical and costly medical equipment, the claims for which insurance has unfathomably denied.  Specifically, Neha’s care requires specialized equipment for showering and personal care (a specialized toilet seat and a “stander” device will help Neha stand in the shower).Beyond medical equipment, Neha requires care beyond what her parents can provide. Her condition requires non-stop medical attention to ensure she’s breathing, so her parents alternate between working daytime and night-time hours so that one parent can be constantly by her side. Neha’s father works days as a pharmacist and stays up all night to assist her; Neha’s mother works the night-shift at the US Postal Service, comes home and sleeps for just a few hours, then tends to her daughter throughout the day.  Your support will allow Neha’s parents to purchase medical equipment and bring on part-time professional help that will enable them to focus on enjoying the only gift that matters – precious and limited time with their beloved daughter.  How you can help:1. Please give generously to help Neha get the medical devices she requires and the quality time with her family she deserves to enhance the dignity of her life.2. Please forward this GoFundMe campaign to at least 5 people.MORE ABOUT NEHA (from her Physical Therapist):Neha is a 13 year-old girl who has a degenerative mitochondrial disease where she is deficient in POLG, a part of her genome. When I started working as Neha’s physical therapist four years ago, we would walk down the block together.  I stood close by to make sure she wouldn’t fall, but together we walked. Today Neha is confined to a chair, unable to sit up alone, and her voice barely rises above a whisper as she does not have the strength to project loudly. Neha’s family is one of strength and kindness. No matter how hard the day, her mom meets me with a smile and thanks me for coming to see her daughter. Her mother does not complain that she barely sleeps, that she’s already lost one daughter, and is watching another slip away.  Instead she worries  that she has used all her sick time to take care of Neha and now any additional days off go unpaid. Everyone in the home understands that Neha is declining, and her mom just feels saddened over lost time with her daughter.In an incomprehensible ruling, her parents’ insurance rejected both a stander and a shower/toileting chair for Neha. Her parents worked with a hospital to file all paperwork correctly and yet insurance responded they are not responsible for her toileting or standing needs. Neha now cries when her family puts her in the bath. Her mother goes into the shower with her and holds her head as they quickly try and wash her. It also takes 2 people to toilet her as there is no way to support her body and head without a specialized chair. Neha is fed through a tube that goes straight into her stomach. Almost every other week, she will now go 2-3 days without speaking, constantly grimacing due to extreme gas pains. A stander would help with her digestion. I have previously asked Neha’s parents if they would allow me to help raise funds. Proud and self-sustaining immigrants, her parents always said no, that they would manage. When they received the notice of rejection for the chair and stander, they agreed for the first time to allow a fundraiser, as time is of the essence.  Neha’s future is uncertain but together, we can help give her family the comfort she so deserves right now. Thank you so much for your help and support.",176,161,2,180,6 months,5 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

The part of the brain that supports his speech was affected by the stroke and he remained in Neuro-Intensive Care Unit for 6 days until he was able to receive enough oxygen on his own to support the rest of his brain function. He was moved to the stroke unit of the hospital where he is currently being monitored. Doctors told the family that he is extremely lucky and he continues to amaze the doctors with his drive to get better. Eventually, he will be moved to St. Charles Rehabilitation Hospital where he will be admitted for an indefinite amount of time.Many of you have called and asked how you can help. This is how. Our goal of this GoFundMe campaign is to do what we can financially to allow Greg to be able to focus on rehabilitation and not to worry about the mounting medical bills or how he will support himself or his family moving forward. Greg has a long road to recovery. As many of you know his livelihood is the CE business which requires him to travel for work on a weekly basis. However, this is not an option right now. He has overcome so many previous obstacles, such as open-heart surgery, but this will be another lengthy road to recovery in terms of weeks in the rehabilitation center and extended home care. Greg’s determination to overcome this continues to amaze everyone around him. He is still positive and thankful for his life and his spirits are up that he will win this fight. If you can contribute to help Greg, please do so. Your donation will allow Greg to focus on his difficult recovery. If you cannot contribute financially, please continue to send positive thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to him and his family. Please share this campaign with your friends, family, and colleagues.If you would like to send a card or personal correspondence to Greg please feel free to send it to the following; Greg Keys, 9 Sunset Lane, Patchogue, NY 11772.  Thank you for considering donating to Greg’s recovery and as Greg always says, “Rock Your Day!”",139,738,8,132,2 months,21 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

My name is Kathlyn Carney and I am so blessed to be able to call Trish Churchill my best friend for the last 9 years. Trish and I met freshman year of high school at Archmere Academy and quickly became inseparable. Even though we both ended up at different colleges and in different cities, we have remained extremely close. Trish is currently studying at the prestigious Thomas Jefferson University’s College of Pharmacy where she is completing her Doctor of Pharmacy degree. She is one of the hardest working people that I have ever met, so it was no surprise to me when she was accepted to the Jefferson College of Pharmacy. I know I speak for so many people when I say that Trish is one of the most dedicated, resilient, selfless and kind people I have ever met. Trish always puts her friends and family first and she has taught so many of us what it means to truly care about someone. In the midst of finishing her last didactic year at Thomas Jefferson University and enjoying her favorite city, Philadelphia, Trish received unexpected news. At the end of February, Trish was diagnosed with the rare autoimmune disease Myasthenia Gravis and more recently stage 4A Thymoma. A thymoma is a tumor that is found in about 10% of patients with Myasthenia Gravis. Trish’s tumor is currently too large to surgically remove, so she is estimated to undergo 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy to shrink the tumor; in hopes that it can be surgically removed following treatment. When Trish told me the news, I was devastated and couldn’t believe this was happening to her. However, I have never met a stronger person than my best friend and I know if anyone can get through this, it’s her. Her attitude since she found out about her recent health conditions has been incredibly admirable. She is determined to complete her final semester of academics on time and begin her final year of rotations as planned in May. Every time I talk to Trish, she is positive and encourages all of her friends and family to have the same optimistic attitude. Despite her situation, Trish has never once asked for sympathy and has continued to be the same resilient and compassionate woman that we all know and love.  By creating this page, we’d like for the Churchill family to solely focus on Trish’s healing process. It is our goal for her to receive the best possible treatment without insurance limiting the medication options available to her. Please join us in supporting Trish’s journey to a cure. All donations will be used for any medical out-of-pocket expenses that the Churchill’s will endure. Thank you so much for your time and donation - it is greatly appreciated.",376,1.3k,2,371,5 months,20 days ago,4 months,2018-09-03

She met with Neurologist the following week who put her on a 7-day steroid and scheduled an MRI for 6/25. The steroid finally relieved the pressure and pain for the first time she first started feeling it a week so prior.  At this point, the Neurologist was not expecting to see anything abnormal on the MRI, but just scheduling for due diligence. After the 7-day steroid pack, the headaches returned. The Neurologist then prescribed a migraine medication. That only partially worked. Last week they called the Neurologist office every day seeking a consistent pain relief management strategy. The Neurologist said there was nothing more she could prescribe until after the MRI and advised if they need relief to go to the ER so they returned to the ER last Thursday night. Megan received an IV with a steroid where for the second time she finally had relief from the pain. She was discharged that night, but once the steroid subsided, the pain returned. They scheduled an MRI for yesterday at 6:30 AM dressed in their work attire, not expecting to find abnormal results. But the results unfortunately showed a sizable malignant tumor in her right brain, bigger than a golf ball, pressing on her brain stem and pushing into her left brain. This was the reason for the constant pressure and headaches. She was immediately admitted back to ER and surgery scheduled for Thursday to remove the tumor. The Neuro Surgeon explained that the cancer is not curable with surgery, its just the first step.  After surgery, she will start treatment.Please consider donating to help show your support and love for these two IG family members. We will be arranging for meals and other supportive activities to help them through this difficult time and to help Megan win this fight. Help spread the word!",475,622,0,473,2 months,2 months ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Hello everyone! 

My name is Ai Sonomura. I have been a good friend of both Megumi and Hiroyasu Nunokawa since high school in Chiba Japan.  Former residents of Utah, work opportunities took them to Indiana about three years ago.  They have five children ranging in age from 18, with plans to head off to college in the fall, to 5.  Over the years I have seen how much they have extended themselves to others, opening up their home, resources and hearts, helping freely and unconditionally.    

They have recently learned of a serious medical condition afflicting Megumi that will significantly impact their family's lifestyle and livelihood for the foreseeable future.  Hiro provides for the family, but they are not wealthy by any means, as Megumi has juggled raising the kids and finding ways to bring in additional income. 

I am copying a portion of her own explanation of the situation from a Facebook post, so please read below to understand the more in-depth details. However, I truly believe it is time they become the recipients of some good will in this uncertain and challenging time for them.  Many who are aware of their recent circumstances have asked how they could best assist, including being willing to send money, which is how we collectively decided this would be the most effective and convenient way to help them at this time.

 

Hi, Families and Friends!Some people might be curious about my situation so I will share a brief of it !I am hospitalized now because they found tumors in my heart and between the heart and lungs. The one in my heart is about 5 cm and the other is 3 cm and tangled in some tubes that connect the heart and lungs, making it hard to breathe, but I'm surviving for now.I am so blessed to have great doctors to take care of this severe issue and they are trying to figure out the best treatments for me. There were some options, like open heart surgery or chemo therapy . Since this is a really rare case, the doctors are discussing from every angle every day.  And for now, chemo looks like the best option to try. (UPDATE: Doctors have been determined that surgery is not possible. They are pending various test results to determine when and how to proceed with the chemotherapy).It might seem like a huge trial, but I have already received so many blessings through this experience! 1️⃣ I am feeling that I have THE BEST family and friends and they love me soooooooo much!(Hiro stays with me all the time. Mia takes care of the other kids and so many families and friends are supporting us) 2️⃣ I am in the right place to receive great treatment!Please include my name in your prayers.  That would be extremely powerful help for me!I love you all  ❤️I will try to update when possible as long as I am able to hold my phone !

布川夫婦は、5人の子供を育てる中で、どんなに忙しくても、困っている方がいるとすぐに助けに行くような、奉仕の人たちです。

個人的にお知らせが難しいので、こちらから少しだけ現状報告を！

ただ今入院中でして、その理由は心臓の中に5センチ大、肺と心臓の外側に3センチ大の腫瘍が見つかり、多分リンパ腫ではないかと。外側にある腫瘍が心臓と肺をつなぐパイプに絡みつき圧迫しているせいで、呼吸が苦しいですがちゃんと生きています。恵まれた事に素晴らしいドクター達のチームが私のために毎日検査と話合いを色んな角度からしてくれて、最も良い治療法を模索してくれています。 あまりにレアなケースなだけに、開胸手術か抗がん剤治療かで意見が二転三転しましたが、今のところは抗がん剤治療の可能性が高いようです。一見、厳しい試練のように見えますが、それでもすでに沢山の溢れる祝福を受けています。

1️⃣ 私には最高の家族と友達がいて、ものすごく愛されていること。（ひろくんは常に私と居てくれて身の回りのことをしてくれます。美愛は自宅で子供達を家事をしてくれています。沢山の素晴らしい友達が毎日色んなサポートをしてくれています）2️⃣凄腕のドクターたちのチームが見てくれている事（一人のドクターから、もし僕があなたの状況ならこのチームで診てもらいたいと言われました）

私には信じる宗教があり、信仰に寄って生きる者なので、どうぞ、どんな形でも言葉でもいいで、私のためにお祈りしてくださいね。お祈りの偉大な力を知ってます。皆さん一人一人が大好きです❤️携帯を持てる限り、また報告します！",279,1.1k,5,283,4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We were told that without immediate treatment he would live only a couple months. April 11th he was admitted to the hospital for anywhere between 30-40 days, until complete remission occurs. At that time he will be allowed home for only a short time, before he will undergo a bone marrow transplant, followed by another 3 months in a secluded living space near the hospital.It goes without saying that this news has thrown our worlds into a complete tailspin. It has been devastating, scary, confusing, and it's all happened so incredibly fast. No one has had much time to really think about the financial crisis this is going to be for Brad and Cindy. Truth is, not very many people could live for 5-6 months on less than 1/2 their income plus a medical bill that is inestimatable. My whole life my parents have stretched slightly beyond their means, relying on faith and frugality, to continually provide me and my brothers opportunities that allowed us to become the people we are today. We are forever indebted to them, and because of this; and like many of you, we want to do whatever we can do within our control to be there for them when life gets really, really  hard. That time has very unexpectedly come, and we want to ask something very big of all of you. Some have known my parents since they were born, some met them when you were all young kids, some are relatives both near and far, co-workers, acquaintances, some of you are my friends, or Luke and Josh's friends. So many people have shown such support, and asked how they can help, we are truly blessed by the company we keep. We cannot say thank you enough for the sincerity we have felt.Can we come together financially to support two of the most humbled-hearted, compassionate, generous, loving, and most genuine people we have ever come to know? What we can say we know for sure is that cancer is awful, and it really can strike anyone at anytime. It is REALLY unfair, and it has the power to destroy a person and their family in more ways than one. You never think it will happen to you, but then one day you wake up and it's all you think about. We are all forever even more compassionate and ready to help others in our situation than ever before. We did a little math, and if we can find 200 people who would be willing to donate $100 dollars each, we can help my parents pay the medical side of this beast. They would be blown away, and it would offer them reprieve from the daily stress and allow them to focus on my dad beating leukemia. Whatever your finances may allow you to afford, we come full of gratitude to say thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",137,253,5,139,4 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN. - Leonard CohenIf I could go back in time and shake the Cecily who cried every time her heart got broken by some frat boy, or comedian or writer of bad movies (sorry ex boyfriends) - I would. I'd say, ""You think your heart is broken now? Cut to 15 years in the future, when a cardiologist will tell you - No….it's really, really broken."" Last month, I was told I had a heart aneurism, which is the cause seemingly of one of my heart valves to have completely malfunctioned. Scarier, the root of my aorta is apparently crumbling and the tissue that basically holds my heart in place in my body is breaking apart. Eventually, it can burst and ya know, that's kinda it.This month, aside from having to re-build the aortic root, they have to fix the valve by most likely replacing it with another one. I'm just going to be honest…I am terrified. What has confounded this is that one of the ""helpers"" at the hospital (after my MRI) found out I live alone and kept saying, ""This is so hard, because you are so so so so alone. How WILL you DO this ALONE?"" I of course know I'm not alone. (My beloved Beagle mix just can't drive or help me with finances.) But a few nights ago, when I was writing my will and thinking ""who would even WANT my 1993 Mazda"", I felt a sense of existentialism never quite described in high school philosophy class. It feels so scary and that’s just the truth. The ""why"" of it can't be answered. I haven't eaten red meat in 10 years, I have never once smoked a cigarette, I'm not a heavy drinker. The only thing that's ever gone up my nose was probably a marble, but that was in the 70s! Aside from these fears, I'm equally terrified of the expenses about to land in my lap. I have health insurance, of course. But even insurance can't keep up with the demands of today's healthcare costs. Open heart surgery is obscene. I do know there will be a lot that's not covered by insurance. There already is. And because I'll spend time in the ICU  and re-habbing after. I won't be able to work one of the many extra jobs I do to make ends meet…for months.  So I'm trying to make myself feel better by putting it like this: I've never had a wedding or a baby. So think of all that could have been spent flying out to see me get married. Or the wedding gifts. Or the baby gifts. Since Bloomingdales won't let me register for ""Aortic Root Replacement"" or Bed, Bath and Beyond does not have a ""pig valve"" or ""aftercare"" section, think of this as a registry.In truth, I'm putting this out into the universe in hopes of easing some of the horror of this. Physically and emotionally, I feel underwater. I have no idea what my financial ""goal"" should be, but if I could just write ""life raft"" up there, I would. Even the tiniest bit of help will help and so from my crumbling heart to yours, I thank you for reading, giving or sharing.",198,584,2,192,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

At first, I got a 30 cm chunk of tumor in my abdomen, and I am through too many destructive but healing chemo-therapy sessions. The beginning was really hard. Thank God, I passed those times.Even though I got cancer, praying and studying were two of the most important things that made me happy.I had a surgery on Jan. 2018. Surgeons got rid of all tumor cells they could see. Now, I feel like this survival journey will end. Right now, I am taking maintenance chemo-therapies to make sure this nightmare illness will not be occurring back. Since I am sick I cannot work or go back my home.  I am out of all my funds. I have to continue to be treated.Please, help me pass the finish line.This is when I need to go into crowd.This is after my surgery.This is when I am under chemo tho' happy.",582,219,4,582,4 months,3 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03

It was so hard for everyone in our family and so many of our friends. As the holidays approached and we were still grieving the loss of my Dad, we got news no one could have dreamed we would hear.  Kerri was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer after a check up to address some digestive issues she was having. We were all devistated, but Kerri and Bob rose quickly.  They had a plan and quickly acted upon it as 2018 started.Kerri started chemotherapy almost immediately and has endured months of treatment, while consistently being strong and positive for herself and family. Watching her over the past few months has been a solid confirmation to me that she is beyond a doubt one of the toughest people God has placed on this earth. Her determination is phenomenal. Everything she does, her family drives her determination. My brother and their boys have also been determined – to keep Kerri and each other moving forward!After a recent scan, we learned that the cancer has grown and the chemotherapy was only marginally effective. Chemotherapy has been stopped and the option of radiation is now being explored. Kerri was refered to MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where they specialize in late stage colorectal cancer. This is the BEST place in the country for her to receive treatment and she was fortunate to get an appointment.  Without a doubt – she needs to go, NOW!The CostsRight now, and the reason I am opening this page, is they need your help. This open-ended trip, as well as what lies beyond, all have an unknown price tag. It stinks that money has to be considered right now – because peace of mind is something everyone deserves. Bob and Kerri have health insurance, but it will not cover everything (co-pays, deductibles, travel, lodging and more).  The new lifestyle changes that their family has endured will be expensive.  How you can helpPlease consider hitting the “Donate Now” button on the upper right side of this page, adding a monetary gift, and giving my sister in-law some financial peace of mind.  Every dollar we raise will go directly to Kerri’s fight. It will help her and Bob cover medical expenses, additional treatments they may opt into, and make it possible for my brother Bob to be with Kerri during her treatments.I hope you're able and willing to support my family through this difficult and devastating experience.  With your help, Kerri, Bob and their boys can focus all of their energy on healing and remission.  It would be great to surpass our goal!Thank you!Thank you so much for reading my story!  Thank you for opening your heart to my family.

In February, Janelle fell outside our home on her way to class and began having pain in her lower back. After a month or so she went to the hospital to see what was wrong, as it couldn’t possibly be from falling a month prior. Doctors thought it was a bruised bone, maybe a slipped disk, or possibly a kidney infection... Come April, after spending 10 days at Mass General Hospital, undergoing multiple scans and tests, Janelle had a biopsy done revealing the pain was from cancer. She was diagnosed with Ewing’s Sarcoma, an extremely rare bone cancer most often found in children and adolescents. When I found out it was cancer, I said to myself, “Of all people to get cancer… I am absolutely stunned it’s Janelle.” If there is a poster child for healthy living and positive energy, it would be her. Before her diagnosis, Janelle was either at the yoga studio, tearin’ up the mountains in the winter, whipping up a delicious healthy (usually vegan) meal in our kitchen, or hanging with friends at the Ski and Board house. She also spent the last two years working with the UMass Amherst based nonprofit, Protect Our Breasts, an organization that focuses on sharing the conversation about chemicals in products that contribute to cancer, and empowering women to make safer choices to protect their health. Janelle is currently the co-president of the UMass Ski and Board Club, and will be beginning her senior year online this fall.  Janelle is still on track to graduate from UMass Amherst in May 2019. As Janelle continues this long journey, she needs your help! She is currently receiving treatment and going through rounds of chemotherapy at Mass General Hospital in Boston. Her treatment is extremely rigorous, tiring, and will be ongoing for the unforeseeable future. Once she is done with chemo, she will most likely need additional treatments such as a bone marrow transplants and clinical trials.

What you may not know is the severity. Alexa, who is 15, has stage IV Osteosarcoma in her right shoulder and it has metastasized to both of her lungs. She had been experiencing increasing pain, and sudden swelling led us to take her to the emergency room for evaluation, and she was admitted for additional testing. We received the diagnosis within days. She had her first inpatient Chemotherapy on March 19th. She will continue Chemotherapy for 10 weeks.

My name is Laura Boyle and I am 27 years old from Smithfield, Rhode Island. Last year I was diagnosed with Von Hippel Lindau Disease. VHL is an extremely rare genetic condition where blood vessel tumors can form in up to ten areas of the body. These tumors can be benign or cancerous. So far, VHL has affected my adrenal glands, my pancreas, and now my brain.My first tumor was discovered when I was in college, just 19 years old. Last year they found a malignant tumor on the head of my pancreas that was resting on my small intestine. Just one short, hectic week after finding this out, my life was uprooted and I was in the OR at Rhode Island Hospital, having pancreatic surgery known as the whipple procedure. A whipple procedure entails removing part of the pancreas, stomach and small intestine, as well as the gallbladder and liver duct. The entire digestive system then needs to be rerouted. After the surgery, they determined the tumor to be pancreatic cancer called a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. This led them to discover that I have a cancerous genetic disease called VHL.After more testing, they also found that I currently have three brain tumors, known as hemangioblastomas that they continue to monitor. These tumors rest on the back of my brain and spine and continue to cause symptoms like nausea and migraines. Throughout recovery, maintaining a healthy weight has been most difficult. I am severely underweight and malnourished and my tumors and digestive issues make it extremely difficult to maintain a normal 27 year old lifestyle. In recent weeks, I have had to take a leave of absence from my teaching career because of my debilitating symptoms. I have the most amazing seventh grade students this year and it breaks my heart that I am no longer well enough to teach them and spend their last few weeks of this school year with them. Right now, I ask you to please help me in any way you can. I am currently struggling to manage my symptoms enough to get back to my students, my life, my wonderful fiancé and my caring family. I am finding it more and more difficult to maintain my job, my health bills, my doctor's appointments, and pay off my student loans. If you can help in any small way, it will mean more than you know! Thank you for reading my story.  I will be using any money I earn on my medical bills and maintaining my student loans while out on leave. This is an inspirational poem I found that was written by a fellow VHL warrior. I couldn't explain my situation any better than she does!“To look at me you’d never knowBut the tumors in me just grow and growNo matter what I do or sayThey just won’t go awayAt first the feelings just flowedThe time stood still, it got very coldFrom a care free teen with my whole life aheadTo a dying teen lying in a bedThat night I lay awake till dawnAnd before I knew I had a new plan drawnI realized something in the dark of nightThat I was going to win this fightThe tumors the doc had foundThe news that put my parents on the groundThey said that I was going to dieBut I wasn’t prepared to say goodbyeSo I got myself ready for warAnd promised my loved ones I’d walk out that hospital doorAnd sure enough the road was roughBut I was never willing to give upI know my war is not over yetBut one thing I’ll never forgetTo smile in troubles remember I’m blessedGod gave me this imperfectionCause he knew I could handle the stressAnd in a funny way I’m glad for that dayfor the scars and the tearsI’ve gathered through the yearsFor all these things is what makes meMy von Hippel-Lindau, My Life, and Me.”",385,711,0,374,3 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Our nephew Calvin who's nine has been diagnosed with stage 4 / group 4 / high risk rhabdomyosarcoma, with the alveolar genetic marker. This is an aggressive form of cancer and has a 20 percent cure rate if the treatments are successful.  Because of the location of the tumors (which are pressing up against major blood vessels), surgery is not permitted at this time.  Calvin will need to undergo chemo in hopes of shrinking the tumors so that surgical removal can take place. They are still waiting on the results of the bone marrow biopsy which took place at the same time his chemo port was put in. A U.S. Army veteran, our brother Chris is the sole financial provider for his wife and four kids and has not left Calvin's side since that trip to the ER.  Chris is on family leave which unfortunately means he does not get paid.  This means there is no income to cover expenses.  Expenses that sadly won't stop adding up during this difficult and life-altering situation: gas, food, utility bills, car payments, mortgage, everyday living expenses.  These are on top of any medical bills that may occur.  This past week is just the beginning to a long battle ahead...physically, emotionally and financially.  Please help Chris and Tiffany by donating.  Any amount is helpful!  Along with your donation, prayers for Calvin are appreciated.  Updates will be provided as we learn more.

FLT3). On Thursday, May 17, 2018 Steph was sent to Stanford Medical Center after results from a local blood test came back with dangerous levels of white blood cells. The tests were a result of Stephanie seeking medical attention after experiencing a recent series of issues that she had believed to be related to her Multiple Sclerosis. Severe headaches, debilitating in nature, a terrible ulcer on her tongue that made it impossible for her to eat and she even blacked out at one point. It was then that she realized this was beyond the challenges that she already dealt with and considered part of her “normal” with MS. Upon her arrival at Stanford they immediately began chemotherapy treatment and told her that she had cancer. It took a couple of days and a very painful bone marrow biopsy to reveal exactly what form of leukemia she would be battling. Given the seriousness of Stephanie’s already highly compromised immunity, the treatment plan for her is very individualized and she is being taken care of with extra care and attention.Tad has not left Stephanie’s side since she was admitted almost two weeks ago, and he plans on supporting her continually in the time ahead. Stephanie is currently undergoing induction chemotherapy with the hopes of putting the cancer into remission before undergoing a bone marrow transplant. If, or should I say when her marrow test comes back clean of the cancer cells, she will undergo stem cell therapy and that will then have them staying in Palo Alto an additional 100 days for 24 hour care and treatment. Much is uncertain at this point, but we do know that the Rothbauer family could use the help of each and every one of us to get through this scary, unpredictable, and very expensive journey.This Go Fund Me account is being set up to go directly to the family to pay for the many costs associated with Stephanie’s current and future treatments.ABOUT STEPHANIE:To know Steph is to love her. Her vibrancy and genuine love of life is present in everything she does. Even during these difficult times. What would cripple many has only displayed her strengths even more. This passion is displayed in everything she is a part of. She has been a supporter of the national and local MS Foundation, she’s a well-recognized interior designer (which class studies she completed in the initial stages of battling her MS), she’s an amazing participant in the county Big Brothers and Big Sisters project where she was recently honored as Big Sister of 2018. Steph received this honor because like everything she commits to she has been committed to her little sister and it is a commitment that she plans to see through the young lady’s time in school and beyond. Steph’s family is her biggest passion and her focus is and always has been to ensure that TJ (age 14), Brayden (age 12), and Mia (age 8) are happy, loved and know their place in her heart. The battle ahead is not going to be easy and the only option is that she comes out the champion, but Steph and her family are going to need all of our support facing this future of uncertainty. For a woman that lives by a plan and a calendar you can imagine the strain and fear that she is feeling and yet she does so with smiles, jokes and making the rest of us still better for being a part of her life. Let’s help where we can and take whatever burden away so that her and her family’s focus can be on her recovery and time together that is and always will be a priceless amenity.WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR:Although Stephanie and Tad have medical insurance through his employer, there are many, many costs that are not covered through insurance. Your generous donations will go towards helping pay for a variety of costs associated with Stephanie’s treatment including:- Co-pays for medications and treatmentsMany of the treatments that Stephanie is and will be receiving are VERY expensive and insurance does not always cover everything. - Gas, hotel rooms and restaurant foodStephanie is currently being treated at Stanford Medical Center in Palo Alto, CA, a 4 hour drive north from her family’s home in Paso Robles. Her future treatments and potential bone marrow transplant will also be at least a few hours from her home. Your contributions will go directly towards covering the many ancillary costs associated with a family of five living away from home for an extended period of time.WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP:In addition to donating, you can help us spread the word!

At that very moment this 31-year-old man's life would change forever; he was suffering a stroke. He displayed all the classic signs, dropping face, tingling on one side of his body, slurred speech and total confusion. He was taken to the emergency room where the diagnosis confirmed that Tim did suffer from a ""mini"" stroke. He stayed overnight in the hospital and after further observation he was released the next day with instructions to return for further evaluation. Shortly after his release, while walking his dogs with his girlfriend, Tasmyn, Tim once again was suffering from another stroke, this time his condition was much more severe.Test after test, Neurologist were baffled and could not pinpoint a definitive diagnosis. After much research the experts saw traits in Tim's condition and tentatively concluded that he may have a disease called Moyamoya. This disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder caused by blocked arteries at the base of the brain. This was a first for Neurologist at the Kaiser Permanente of San Diego, so they were perplexed in how to treat it. During that time, Tim had worsened even more. To the point where he could no longer speak, had lost his ability to move his right arm and became very lethargic. Initially, doctors began a regiment of blended medications in hopes it would stabilize him. Unfortunately, the medication was not working so the ultimate and last resort was for the Neurologist to perform an angioplasty to the area of Tim's brain that was not getting enough blood flow.With the grace of God and the many prayers offered up for Tim, the procedure was successful. The doctors were able to open up the vessel and to get blood flowing back into the affected area of Tim's brain. After spending one week in the Direct Observation Unit and another week in the ICU, Tim was transferred to a Rehabilitation Center where he will have to relearn how to speak, walk and do many of the basic functions of everyday life that he was doing prior to his stroke.Tim's journey is long, but he is resilient and determined to get back to some type of normality. As you can imagine the cost of his stay in the hospital, the surgery, the treatment plan, the medications and all the other expenses you can think of will be another challenge for him to overcome.To our friends, family and anyone reading this message, your donation to assist Tim in tackling this debt will be greatly appreciated. We are humbled and words or actions could never repay your kindness and generosity.  However, if you are not able to make a monetary donation, please keep Tim in your thoughts and prayers.

She will start renovations soon and will try to sell the house as soon as it is done. Currently, her home has no kitchen, no living room, no washer/dryer and only one functioning bathroom. That was ""fine"" until she was diagnosed with cancer. Now she cannot stay there anymore, nor she can deal with the remodeling herself (to save money she was going to supervise it). We plan to rent her a small apartment, preferably near her son and his family immediately, since she will start chemo on July 13th. In the meanwhile and whenever she wants, she will stay at my house. She knows she is always welcome here (we set up a bedroom for her) and I will do everything I can to be with her at every medical appointment and treatment, but I know she would like to have her own place and be close to her grandson. By the way, Kika's son and his family live in a two-bedroom condo, so there is no space to accommodate Kika and her beloved dogs comfortably.Work and IncomeWork-wise; the situation is even tougher. Kika always worked as an independent contractor but has no new projects (nor she can take new projects right now.) So, she will have no income at all, but a very small retirement check.Health Insurance and Medical ExpensesHer health insurance is Medicare, and she will have several out of pocket expenses. We also would like to get a second opinion from MD Anderson or John Hopkins in Maryland and to join medical trials around the U.S. that offer hope. This gofundme campaign is to help us get through the next few months until her house is sold. She plans to use the house money to pay for her future expenses. Unfortunately, we cannot wait until she sells the house and, with no new project/work, she cannot afford to rent an apartment or pay for her mortgage, treatment, and medication. I know Kika has some great friends out there and that you all will help her through this. Any amount is highly appreciated. I plan to post a few updates here, but if you would like to contact Kika and/or myself directly, please email TeamWinKika@gmail.com. We both have access to that email so that I can send updates in her behalf. Thank you all so very much.",163,619,6,165,2 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is precious and dear to so many as a wife, mother, daughter, sister, grandmother, mother-in-law, aunt, sister-in-law, friend and so much more.In February 2018, Mrs. Tammy was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She had surgery on March 15th to remove part of her pancreas. At that point, the cancer had not metastasized and we were believing for a surgical cure. After Mrs. Tammy recovered from surgery, she began chemotherapy.  On August 8th, she had a CT scan done to see if the chemo was working. Unfortunately, the chemo is not working and there are now multiple tumors in her abdomen.Through much research and many phone calls to oncologists, medical centers and the top hospitals all over the country, Mrs. Tammy has found New Hope Medical Center. Their central office is in Arizona, and their treatment hospital is in Mexico. They offer a 12 day cancer treatment. This treatment is her next best option for a cure. Through much prayer and faith, Mr. Tim and Mrs. Tammy have concluded that this is her best option and the door that God is opening. Fortunately, they allow one person to go with her and stay with her for the duration of the treatment. Because of the aggression of the cancer, we are hopeful Mrs. Tammy gets approved to go next week (August 20th).  Our goal is to raise $35,000  to completely cover the cost of the 12 day treatment and travel to get there.  If you feel so led to give, we thank you so much! Please also join us in prayer for healing, peace, wisdom and for God's will to be done. Join us in the fight on the journey to Mrs. Tammy's recovery!A note from Tim and Tammy: ""Thank you for joining us in this fight. We are so humbled by all of your love, prayers and any financial support you can offer. God bless you!""The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.

At this point, insurance has not approved to cover the required shots for her treatment.  Her family plans to proceed with or without their approval to ensure she receives the needed treatment to get her back to normal.Darice has been by her side while Daddy Louis has been home taking care of her two sisters, 'Ihilani and Kolokea.  Peka has a huge support base from her family, friends and church family.  Her faith in God is strong and we believe that God has his hands on her and she will be his walking testimony to share his miracle healing upon her.  While prayers are what she needs the most, medical bills are starting to come in and as much as her family hates asking for help, there have been so many people reaching out wanting to help financially so they have decided to start this page to aslo keep everyone updated on her progress.  We Love you all and thank every one of you for your love and prayers.Peka and the Garcia OhanaPeka can do all things thru Christ who strenghthens her.  Phillipians 4:13",275,1.7k,19,276,2 months,11 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,60,Advanced Cancer Therapy Treatment,https://www.gofundme.com/advanced-cancer-therapy-treatment,"DALLAS, TX","May 30, 2018","$85,000","$31,110","A final chance to liveHello there. My name is John Bacile and I’m a Christian father of 4, and a stage 4 cancer patient with only a few months left to live (Again.)I know that some of you reading this may have also heard these words from your doctor, and if you haven’t, I can tell you, it is sobering. Your entire world comes to a stop. By the time I discovered I had bladder cancer 2 and a half years ago, it wasalmost too late. I had a very aggressive, invasive cancer that had already eaten into the muscle wall of my bladder.My options were so stark, so quickly, that I could barely breathe. I was told that unless I had a Cystectomy (surgery to remove the bladder and other nearby organs that are affected) and take Chemotherapy and Radiation for 3-6 months, I would probably only live 12 months and suffer a painful death as the cancer was obviously progressing in an unfavorable area. Even if I elected to allow the surgery, the cancer may have already grown past the point of being eradicated.I really wasn't given other choices and the Oncologists wanted to begin their operations, chemo and radiation within 2 weeks. But I consider myself fortunate that my first instinct was to pray. Seemingly out of nowhere, I remembered a book I had read the year before that discussed holistic therapies for cancer patients and it recommended ingesting overwhelming clean and raw nutrition in large doses in order to rebuild your immune system's natural weapons against disease.So I politely refused the doctor’s advice since having come to believe that destroying my immune system with chemicals and poison would greatly affect my odds of living a quality life in the few months I had left with my family. Instead, I decided to go on an all-natural, holistic, organic diet - juicing, raw organic foods, steamed vegetables, lean meats and various supplements, vitamins and enzymes, etc.That was February 2016 and we acted immediately with no hesitation. However, because the cancer was so aggresive by June it had begun to cut off urination and so I elected to have a secondary surgery called a TURP where they go in and cut out as much of the tumor as possible. The pain and the constriction were immediately relieved, but not for long. By August, I needed another operation, and by December, a third.By the time of that operation 11 months had passed and the tumor had now merged so much with my bladder that it was increasingly difficult to tell them apart in key areas like the ureters where urine drains from the kidneys to the bladder. I remember that disappointing day when I was informed that the doctors could perform no more operations; the cancer would only grow from here.The day after the December 2016 operation, my kidneys began to fail. The next morning, I needed an emergency Nephrostomy (where tubes are inserted into your kidneys through your back to drain them.)I remember being very discouraged that day as I lay in my hospital bed. Tubes in the front of me, and bags and tubes on my sides and back; the pain of back to back operations and the dreadful thoughts in my head of how quickly I was deteriorating were overwhelming. One day in the beginning when I had initially prayed to the Lord, I heard His voice tell me, “This disease is not unto death.” It was quiet; it was deep, and I daily held on to it as I fought to beat back the cancer. “But what now?” I thought. “After all this how could I possibly be saved?” Because also in June of that year, a new breakthrough in Immunotherapy for bladder cancer had been rushed to the market by the FDA, the first such advance in over 30 years. I remember thinking about how fortunate I would be if only I could take the IV therapy. However, the FDA had approved the wonder drug only for dying patients who had exhausted all other standard options - surgery, chemo, and radiation.But remember I had turned all that down.How unfortunate, I thought, that something that could possibly save me was so close and yet so far. While I was pondering our limited options, the Oncologist informed us that because I was given the emergency Nephrostomy, I was no longer a potential Chemo patient. And as of that day, I had technically exhausted all possible cures. I was now terminal, and eligible for the immunotherapy.And just like that, I was the second person in Dallas Texas to begin taking the advanced bladder cancer drug, “TECENTRIQ.” And then like magic after only 3 months, the scans showed that I had responded wonderfully to it. All the cancer outside of my bladder had disappeared and the main tumor had shrunk over 25%. What great excitement and hope we had. It happened so quickly and was such a miracle at the very last minute. But cancer is very clever and unfortunately, after only 8 months, the drug stopped working and the next scans showed that the cancer was back and worse it was growing in many other places as well. Month after month we continued with a similar bladder Immunotherapy and always taking the nutrition program as there was nothing else to do. As the months have passed, the cancer had continued to spread to my kidney and my lymph system in my throat and groin, and the main tumor has become very large. 2 weeks ago we took new scans since an additional 8 months have passed since the last, and based on them, the oncologists have again given me only months to live. Thank you for reading this far because you won't believe what happened next. Naturally our hopes and hearts were shattered and our finances had become utterly depleted. I know this is how it is for so many people with cancer, and my heart aches for those less fortunate than myself. My story up until now is the same story so many people share. It's just a devastating disease in so many ways.I am once again faced with this fact - If I do not have a miracle very, very soon, I am going to die. This was not as frightening to me as it once was though, because we have already had so many miracles during our journey that we have simply come to expect them. It seems that whatever we needed, whenever we needed it, was always there. (But this time, I must admit, I didn’t know what else there could possibly be) Are you going through a cancer trial or any other great difficulty in your life? I want to encourage you to never give up and always, always trust the Lord. He is good and merciful. With all this despair and difficulty surrounding us, our trust in the Lord was all we had left. That was when, only two days ago, two of my customers who had heard about my cancer walked into my business and sat down. They said that they are involved on the margins in one of the world’s most exciting cutting edge scientific Immunotherapy drugs, developed at Baylor Medical College in Houston Texas. They wanted to know if I’d go to a clinic in India to take treatment.And again, seemingly out of nowhere, just hours after I had been on the verge of accepting my imminent demise, my fatalism has turned into hope. For me, this is not a trial. The drug has been proven to work and is not just for bladder cancer; it has already completed a remarkable trial and it works for all solid tumor cancers.There I was, as you can imagine, stunned, speechless, and light as a feather as another timely miracle was laid at my feet.  But in order to take advantage of it I will need a lot of financial help. That's where you come in and I need your help as fast as possible - timing is essential - I must leave soon and begin the treatment that could well save me from this aggressive cancer.Having to act so quickly, we cannot take the time to first raise the funds, so we are leaving June 3rd on faith and well-placed hope because this treatment has been proven to work favorably on 40% of the first group who had been given treatment. And now the door has been opened for us to go. The cost of the medicine and travel expenses is in the neighborhood of $85,000/95,000 - and the initial part needs to be raised fairly quickly.Fighting this disease for 3 years now, has left us with virtually no money in order to take advantage of the treatment being offered to us. From a brief email this week sent to a few of our family and friends - an initial amount of cash was raised to begin the process and secure a deposit in order to be accepted into treatment.However, none of the estimated $85,000 plus is covered by insurance so we are needing to turn to the mercy and grace of anyone wishing to help. Even if you cannot help us financially, please sign up for our blog and follow our experiences as you or someone you may know could easily need this therapy in the future – hopefully as it gets less and less expensive.This is what we can share with you as of now:-            We are asking that you donate any cash amount you can via Go Fund Me. We are also asking that you donate any excess Frequent Flier points as we can use these points by giving miles in exchange for cash. -            From our initial email above, we additionally received donations from several people of over 600,000 Frequent Flyer miles. With a portion of these, we were able to purchase 3 roundtrip airfares as my two sons Kelly 19 and David 28 will be going with me. (David will only stay for 3 weeks)Here is our Itinerary:-          June 3rd through June 6th we fly from Dallas to NY to London to New Delhi India. (There were direct flights but I'm so easily fatigued we needed to factor in a couple of rest nights)-           My first injection will be June 20th. -           Second injection will be July 3rd, and the third and final injection will be July 17th.-           By the 2nd injection, I should begin to see reduction in tumor sizes. By the 3rd injection, my cancers will be a fraction of their original sizes. By August 1st, I should be in full remission. What a glorious day that will be!-          HOW DOES THE TREATMENT WORK-          The treatment is a dendritic cell immunotherapy.-           The technique is absolute cutting edge state of the art.-          It was developed at Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas-          Cancer tissue is taken from the main tumor, and then the DNA of the patient’s white blood cells are altered to attack that specific cancer.-          It works on all solid cancers.-          Tests to date show the treatment to be extraordinarily effective.  The treatment has no side effects and results begin immediately.-          The treatment has not yet been approved in the U.S. but has been approved in India, that's why I am going there to receive the treatment.-          However, the very first United States trial will be at Baylor College of Medicine starting late next month on pancreatic cancer.  The treatment I will be receiving in India is a very similar treatment being given to the pancreatic patients here in the first American trial.I'm so excited!-          Because after looking at my 3-year medical history, my immune system, and estimated time left to live - the scientists believe that I have an excellent probability of having no discernable tumors by the end of August.-            I thank you all in advance for helping me and my family. Without help from people like you there would be no hope for us. You are our only hope.God bless you all so very much,And thank you.

Medical,60,Ella vs. Childhood Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/5934djk,"JOHNSTON, RI","March 10, 2018","$25,000","$31,050","One day a little girl is placed in your arms.One day that little girl says her first word.One day she takes her first steps, and before you know it...One day she is off to kindergarten.Then, one day, life changes.Ella is a beautiful 6 year old. She sings and dances like it’s her job. She spends countless summer days playing at the beach, and school year afternoons with friends, family, or belting out her favorite songs like Moana’s “How Far I’ll Go.” She knows that she wants to be a singer or a princess, (or maybe even both), one day when she grows up. Ella has won the praise and acknowledgement of her teachers for being a conscientious and courteous student and an amazing friend and classmate. On Monday, February 12, 2018, Ella stayed home from school with a rash her mom, Tracy, believed to be Fifths Disease. While on the way to the pediatrician’s office for a quick check to be sure, Ella’s dad, Mike, noticed a strange lump on her lower left back. Because Ella and Tracy had attended a roller skating party 3 days prior to this visit, the pediatrician diagnosed the non-painful lump as a muscle spasm, along with her confirmation that Ella had Fifths Disease. When the lump did not change two days later, Tracy contacted the pediatrician, asking for further exploration of its cause. The pediatrician agreed, and Tracy set an appointment for an ultrasound at Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, RI for 4pm on Friday, February 16. By 4:15pm on the day of the ultrasound, Tracy, Mike, and Ella were being ushered to the Emergency Room at Hasbro for further testing on what the doctors determined was a soft tissue lump. From there...that day, and the ones that immediately followed... everything became a blur. Encouraging test results came back one by one, giving the family hope, until the MRI displayed every family’s worst fear; Ella has Ewing’s Sarcoma. Through this process, a family learns a lot. They learn to take their train that until now, had encountered the same bumps and turbulence most families experience, and switch it to a track of uncertainty. A track that is often plagued with long waits and dark tunnels, much like a roller coaster at Disney World, Ella’s favorite place to visit. Parents learn to say, “My daughter has cancer,” and only cry on those days when they wonder why, and they tell people how they’ve learned that Childhood Cancer Research is devastatingly underfunded. They learn how to tell their daughter that she will lose her hair, and that she won’t be able to regularly attend school where all of her friends continue their routine. They learn how to research and explain medical procedures, while fielding questions and giving care to their child. Family members and friends learn to ask, “What can I do,” or “What do you need” before even saying “Hello.”Most importantly, a 6 year old girl learns that even though she doesn’t feel sick, there is a thing in her body called a tumor that the doctors removed...mostly...but that some sneaky cells hung around to try to make more mischief. She learns where her chemo port is, and that the awesome nurses and doctors at Hasbro treat her with gentle kindness even when performing physically difficult procedures. Ella learned that these cells she has need chemotherapy to go away for good. And that’s what they will do. They will go away for good, because no singing princess will stand for a devious disease blocking her way.Parents learn that, even with healthcare, there’s unpaid leave from work and travel expenses that add up. The doctors at Sloan Kettering in New York City are specialists in Ewing’s, and they have agreed to see Ella and help treat her. This will mean regular trips from Rhode Island to New York. Even with donated sick days, Tracy does not have enough sick time to get her through the eight plus months of chemo Ella will need to kick Ewing’s Sarcoma to the curb. Even after the chemo, there will be months of radiation, blood work, scans, and doctor’s visits to make sure our singing princess Ella remains on the road to recovery.Tracy, Ella, and Mike have a long way to go before their train can switch back to a more well-lit, less tumultuous track. Until then, they need our help so finances do not add extra bumps and worries to their already burdened travels. Because...One day, Ella and her family will celebrate new milestones.One day will be the last chemo treatment.One day will be the first of countless clear scans and tests.One day we will all join Ella and her family in celebrating a cure for everyone.Ella, Tracy, and Mike are forever grateful for the kindness of friends, family, and especially those who give without ever having met Ella. She promises to send you an autographed picture when she becomes a famous, singing princess.",383,1.5k,8,379,5 months,5 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

Here’s a background into Elroi’s few years on God’s beautiful earth so far.Our Miracle baby Elroi was born on the 29th of January 2015. He was born without opened nostrils which impeded his ability to breathe, a condition the doctors termed as Bilateral Choanal Atresia. Since babies are obligatory nose breathers he was not able to compensate by breathing through his mouth. At only a few minutes old, he experienced his first of three pulmonary cardiac arrests and had to be resuscitated, and several pinches administered just so he could stay alive. It was scary as a parent to see the frail body of our supposed bundle of joy go through this life threatening experience; his color would turn pink when he cried, meaning he had sufficient oxygen in his body, to an eerie purple when his mouth was closed, which meant he was oxygen-deficient. Elroi was rushed to the major teaching hospital in Ghana called Korle Bu Teaching Hospital as a matter of urgency, where a life-saving operation of perforating the nasal cavity was performed. This was not to be the only time he would go under the knife. Elroi has had other operations since this first one, including removal of the stents, and a heart surgery at five months to close an open duct.To compound issues, Elroi was later diagnosed to be profoundly deaf in both ears which led to another diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome. This is known to occur only in 1 in every 10,000 births. It is a complex combination of medical conditions which includes Coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities (severe to profound sensoneural hearing loss in both ears)After several trials and speech therapy with two fitted hearing aids, the doctors in Ghana concluded that a cochlear implant would be the best solution in aiding him to hear.Unfortunately this procedure is not done in our homeland Ghana, hence our doctor suggested Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) in Columbus, Ohio. NCH requested to redo all the assessments to ascertain if truly our son was eligible for the Cochlear implants. This reassessment came at a cost of $6,000 which we paid in full prior to the  tests getting done. After the various evaluations were conducted it was confirmed that Elroi is indeed a candidate for a cochlear implant in order for him to have the gift of hearing. With hearing, Elroi will be able to speak as these two essential life skills are interdependent in Elroi’s case.Now..to get the cochlear implant surgery done comes with a price tag of $50,000. The Nationwide Children’s Hospital has requested payment in full before surgery can be done, and as per the Cochlear Implant Specialist we met with, the surgery needs to be done as soon as possible…the further we delay the further Elroi’s speech development is impacted negatively. A lot has been committed so far to get us to this stage and your benevolence will be greatly appreciated to give our little miracle the needed hearing required to complete his full cycle development. Any amount will be greatly appreciated.",321,1.9k,5,310,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

She has an infectious smile and loves to laugh with her family and friends. Christina also loves to eat, but because of a rare disease called Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction, she can’t. Her digestive system won’t move and absorb nutrients like it should, instead food causes a great deal of pain, nausea and retching. The doctors at Cleveland Clinic have told her she is in intestinal failure and the only hope that remains is a modified multi-visceral transplant, which means she needs a stomach, duodenum, small intestine and pancreas transplant to have hope to eat - and to live. She is currently awaiting transplant.Right now Christina is receiving all of her nutrition through a surgically placed IV line that provides the nutrition her digestive system can’t (Total Parenteral Nutrition), but without the ability to eat anything she will go into liver failure, and as she knows all too well, long-term use of surgically placed IV lines brings life-threatening infections. Please join us in praying that a transplant will happen soon.During the transplant evaluation at Cleveland Clinic Christina was told the cost would be in excess of a million dollars, and although she has insurance, there are significant amounts insurance is expected not to pay. As part of the evaluation she was counseled to begin fundraising to help cover the costs of transplant, which is why this page is being created. In addition to medical costs, Christina and her mom, who will be her primary caregiver (required for transplant), will have to stay in Cleveland awaiting transplant because Christina cannot be more than three hours away when she receives the call that a donor has been found. After transplant she will be required to stay in the area for a minimum of 3-6 months. No travel or living expenses are covered by insurance.Christina is a delightful young lady with a big smile and a heart full of dreams for the future. Will you please help her raise the funds she needs to get a transplant? Asking for help is hard, but with your help, she will move forward to being able to eat again and live a life full of hope for a bright future.You can follow Christina’s journey at christinasjourney.com.

We have known Jen for many  years through our church. She is a wife to Matt and mother to three beautiful children. Recently, Jen went to the ER for what she believed was a kidney stone. The CT not only confirmed the kidney stone, but also found a 13.5 cm mass in her liver, and two soft tissue masses. The natural doctor Jen has been working with the last year has specifically been working on her circulating cancer cells (a/k/a CTCs). All of this work has not been in vain as her cell count is now down to 2. Upon follow up, a PET scan has revealed that the cancer has spread.  The natural doc has a connection with a specialist in CA, Dr. Ahvie. Dr. Ahvie is an M.D. and graduated from Johns Hopkins. He takes very difficult cancer cases and offers targeted approaches with chemotherapy, as well as another therapy that acts as a cancer vaccine of sorts. (They still have more information to obtain.) The targeted therapy would be based on the RGCC testing that Jen did with her natural doc that outlined the exact chemo that gave her the highest death rate of cancer cells. Dr. Ahvie has been consulting with Jen’s natural doc and believes she would be a candidate for his therapy. He indicated how happy he is for the work that has been done to lower the CTC count, as it’s important to his therapy as well.This is where you come in. Jen and her family need prayer warriors to rally behind her. The specialized treatment from Dr. Ahvie in CA is not covered by Jen’s medical sharing company, so she also needs monetary funds to cover testing, traveling, procedures, etc. Upon her return from the initial treatment, Jen will need to keep up Dr. Ahvie’s protocol at home, which will involve costs as well.Please join kingdom forces with us to pray specifically for Jen and her family. And please consider giving a monetary gift for these mounting medical costs. God bless you, and please continue to follow Jen’s journey here as we give updates. We would be so grateful to have you share this on social media or email.Abbie Brigham and Mary Graves____________________________________________Prayer Requests by Jen:Please pray that I would have spiritual and physical strength, not fear the future, and trust in my Sovereign God completely. May He be glorified.Please pray for my dear husband, Matt, as he works tirelessly to provide working his full time job and extra side jobs to pay for medical expenses. Matt also faithfully serves the kids and me at home as I have not been operating at full speed.Pray for my children to trust in Christ and draw near to Him. They also serve our family so sweetly. Pray for their strength and for God to bless them.Of course, please pray for total healing and for us to have wisdom as we navigate the path the Lord has for us to walk.Please pray for God to provide for my medical expenses.Please pray for doctors to have wisdom for the best treatment.Please pray that I would be able to eat and sleep and hold my weight. The doctor emphasized this is very important.Thank you from our hearts. We praise God for every prayer, every kindness, and His provision.  - Jen",168,1.2k,4,166,1 month,15 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have been studying at Portland State University as an exchange student since April. I’m writing this for my friend, Sho Morita, who was tragically hit by a car. Sho’s body and head were seriously injured. He was in the ICU for a month. The driver was intoxicated over the legal limit and was arrested soon after. I established this funding campaign so that he and his family can receive much needed financial help.Sho is also a  senior at Waseda University. He came to Portland in April as a member of the same International exchange program. After arriving in Portland, besides studying English, he joined the college soccer team and was spending a great time here with friends in Portland. He is bright, funny, and always friendly. He is adored by everyone who gets to know him.Sho’s family and friends were  stunned by this accident. His life was completely disrupted. I am asking our friends and the community to offer help in order to relieve the burden on his family. We would gladly appreciate anything you can offer: prayers, thoughts, and donations. 【How the accident happened and Sho’s condition】On June 25th, at midnight, Sho was hit by a car which drove through a red light while Sho was walking on the crosswalk on his way to his host family’s home. The driver was reported to be intoxicated above the legal limit. After the accident, Sho was transported to OHSU hospital. Thanks to the work of OHSU’s doctors and nurses, his life was spared. However, his body was severely injured. He sustained a severe head injury along with a broken right arm and right leg.  Because of the damage to his brain, doctors believed that he may be in a coma forever, or he might lose his life.He was in a coma for almost a month after the accident, but he woke up miraculously.  Since then he has recovered well with care from his family, friends, and the staff from OHSU. HE IS NOW FULLY CONSCIOUS and capable of communicating with us. He was then transferred from OHSU Hospital to a Japanese hospital for financial reasons. It’s still unclear when he can be discharged. Based on his condition, the doctors advise us that we should be prepared for a long stay at the hospital.【Medical expenditures and other costs】Regarding his medical expenditures, Sho bought insurance for studying abroad and his medical fees are compensated to a certain extent. However, medical fees in the U.S. are much more expensive than in Japan.His insurance coverage has reached its limit due to the U.S. medical expenses and transportation to Japan. The family will be overrun by medical costs because of his continuing care.The cost of transporting his family to the U.S. and a percentage of the medical fees in Japan are not covered by his insurance and his family had to pay for it by themselves. Furthermore we are unsure when he can leave the hospital, the total amount of medical fees is unknown. Thus I am establishing this fund and asking for your help to reduce his family’s burden even just a bit.【Goal of the fund and how to use it】All of the donations will be handed to Sho’s family and used for the transportation cost of his family and the medical fee in Japan as written above. I am setting the goal at $80,000. To be honest, the expenditures in the future vary greatly depending on how well Sho can recover, so the goal is only a guide. It is likely to cost more than that.【How you can help Sho】It goes without saying that any donation will help Sho and his family no matter how much you donate, and it would be more helpful than you think. You can donate easily by credit card and the minimum amount of donation is $5.I would appreciate it if you share this page via Facebook or Twitter as well as give a donation. Either posting this page directly on SNS or sharing someone’s post is welcome. If you can’t donate but would like to help, please share this page and this would help him and his family.I want to say again and again that both the donation and the share will help Sho and his family. Cooperation is powerful. We really need your help.Thank you for your time. Please help Sho for the sake of his future.Suguru Minはじめまして。現在大学4年生で4月からポートランド州立大学に留学していますミンスグルと申します。今回、同じ大学のプログラムで一緒に留学に来ていた友人の森田晶が不幸にも交通事故に遭い、脳を含め重傷を負って長期間の入院を余儀なくされたため、皆さんに少しでも協力していただければと思い、このクラウドファンディングを開設しました。晶は現在大学4年生で、僕と同じく4月からポートランドで留学をはじめ、大学での勉強に加えて大学のサッカーチームに所属するなど充実した留学生活を送っていました。普段から明るくて、面白くて、いつでも場を盛り上げてくれて、本当にみんなから慕われていました。今回の事故については晶に過失は一切なく、家族や友人を含め本当に悔しい思いをしています。そして何よりも悔しい思いをしているのは晶本人だと思います。晶と晶の家族のためにも少しでもみなさんに協力をしていただければ幸いです。【事故の経緯と晶の状況】6月25日深夜、晶がホストファミリーの家に帰る途中の横断歩道で、赤信号を無視した車に轢かれ大怪我を負いました。運転手は飲酒運転で、晶に過失は一切ありません。その後ポートランドの大学病院に搬送され、幸い事故直後には一命を取り留めましたが右手右足を複雑骨折し、脳へのダメージも著しかったため、当初医師からは最悪命を落とすか、よくても寝たきりの状態のままだろうと伝えられるような状況でした。その後一ヶ月弱ほどこん睡状態が続いていましたが、奇跡的に目を覚まして、今では意識もはっきりしていて会話ができるほどにまでなりました。先日アメリカから日本の病院に搬送されましたが、依然として退院のめどは立っておらず、引き続き入院が必要な状態です。それに加えて、回復した後も長いリハビリ生活を強いられることになります。【医療費やその他費用について】医療費について、晶は留学用の保険に加入しているため一定額までの入院治療費は補償されるのですが、アメリカの医療費が日本と比べて段違いに高額なため、アメリカでの入院治療費、アメリカから日本へ搬送する際の費用で保険金額の上限にほぼ達しているのが現状です。ご家族のアメリカへの渡航費や日本での治療費に関しては、留学用の保険ではカバーされずご家族自身で賄わなければなりません。また、日本での治療費やリハビリにかかる費用については退院のめども立っていないため、いくらかかるかも想定できません。そこでこのページを通じて少しでもご家族の負担を減らせればと考えています。【募金の目標金額とその用途】募金していただいた金額は全額晶の家族に引き渡され、上で述べたご家族のアメリカへの渡航費と日本での治療費に使われます。目標金額としては80,000ドル(約880万円)に設定しています。正直今後かかる費用が晶の回復状況によって大きく変動するため、目標金額はあくまで目安です。目標金額以上に費用がかかる可能性も大いにあります。その際には目標金額を変更することも考えています。【皆さんにお願いしたいこと】当たり前ですが、どんなに少額でも募金をしていただけるだけで晶とご家族のためになりますし、皆さんが考えている以上に助けになります。アメリカのWEBサイトなので英語の表記しかないのですが、クレジットカードがあれば3分ほどで募金ができるのでぜひよろしくお願いします。5ドルから募金ができます。以下のURLに募金の方法が日本語で書いてあるのでご確認ください。 http://colorguardaf3.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/01/05/173429 また、このページをFacebookやTwitterでシェアしてもらえるだけでも、募金と同じくらい助けになります。このページを引用して投稿していただくのでも、誰かの投稿をシェアをしていただくのでもどちらでもかまいません。何かしらの理由で募金ができない方、募金とまではいかなくても力になっていただける方はシェアをしていただけるだけで十二分に助かります。もちろん募金をした上でシェアをしていただければ、これ以上ないほど力になります。繰り返しにはなりますが、募金とSNSでのシェアのいずれも、皆さんが考えている以上に晶とご家族の力になります。皆さんの力を少しでもお借りできれば幸いです。ここまで長い文章を読んでいただきありがとうございます。晶とご家族のためにご協力よろしくお願いします。明　卓",549,1.8k,8,561,1 month,27 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She is a graduate of Episcopal High School and currently a student at UVA.Good news is that lymphoma is treatable, and her odds of beating the disease are high. Bad news is that her cancer is stage 4, so treatment will be aggressive.  I can't image what Layne is going through right now. Mr. Berry and his wife have a lot on their plate. It's hard to shower, get decent meals, go to work, and tend to your own needs during times like these. Not to mention the medical costs for cancer are super high! On average, the cost for lymphoma treatment is 10,000 a month. Layne will also have reoccuring medical costs at minimum for the next five years, as she will have to follow-up with her oncologist after she beats the cancer.Mr. Berry is an amazing teacher and someone who truly cares for his students.

Medical,61,Greg & Dawn Lee: Fighting Together!,https://www.gofundme.com/greganddawnfighttogether,"CHARLOTTE, NC","May 8, 2018","$40,000","$30,795","Dawn and Greg Lee built their life together on the foundation of faith in God, love and family. Through their unselfishness, strength and perseverance, they approach every challenge as a platform for connecting with others and for bringing God's love into our broken world. Through every trial they face, they are steadfast in putting everyone else first. Now, they need our help. Four years ago Greg Lee was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. Then, on April 4, 2018, in the echo of three life-changing words, ""you have cancer,"" Dawn was thrust from her role as a faithful caregiver and sole breadwinner into a fight for her own life. The process of fighting Greg's cancer the past four years has severely impacted them financially and the future costs of fighting two cancers at the same time are overwhelming. We are hoping to raise enough money to cover their ongoing medical costs and the loss of income from the inability to work fulltime, while both are being medically treated. All funds donated will go directly toward offsetting their expenses and allowing them to continue to fight. Dawn and Greg are eternally grateful for your prayers and any support you can provide.Greg's Story In 2014, Greg was shaving one morning and noticed a lump on the right side of his neck. Three physicians and two biopsies later, the diagnosis was confirmed. Squamous cell carcinoma. To make matters worse, two months after Greg's second biopsy, he began experiencing extreme vertigo, headaches and other symptoms. After seeing several doctors, the source of the problems was diagnosed as Type 1 diabetes. The healthy diet he had begun to fight the cancer was no longer healthy for him.The next eighteen months would see continued tumor growth, and a dramatic increase in fatigue. Greg was forced to cease working in March 2016 to allow his body to heal and recover from the trauma. His neck tumor was the size of a large grapefruit and was causing a tremendous amount of nerve damage and pain. In September 2016, Greg was not expected to survive long enough to see Christmas.Yet, God had other plans. Greg was referred to another radiation oncologist, who offered a new procedure: extremely high doses of radiation over a short period of time. Over the next nine months the tumor continued to shrink, far beyond everyone's expectations. One could use the word 'miracle' when describing how much better Greg's quality of life became. Not cured. Not in remission. But Greg was Greg again and life was so much better! Unfortunately, Greg’s fight is not over. On Feb. 2, 2018, a scan revealed that the tumor had doubled in size and was growing again. The limited treatment options are being explored and the future is uncertain, but Dawn and Greg aren’t giving up.  Dawn's StoryDawn is a natural caregiver. She is 100% a Mom to her kids and a Nana to her grandkids. Over the past four years, her superhero skills were called upon while serving as Greg's caregiver, supporting their family financially and caring for an untold number of women through her job as a RN at an OB-GYN clinic.Her own battle with cancer began in April 2018, when cramping and a GI bleed landed her in the ER. The CT scan showed a mass in her colon and she was kept overnight for more tests. The bleeding was so severe, Dawn lost two liters of blood the first day. The subsequent scope and biopsy revealed a large cancerous mass that needed to be removed.  Surgery went well, but the tumor was larger than anyone expected and of the 27 lymph nodes that were removed, 15 tested positive for cancer. Dawn was diagnosed with high risk, Stage 3c colon cancer. As her body recovers from the surgery, Dawn is meeting with colorectal oncologists to discuss the different options for chemotherapy. She is facing six months of intense treatment. Their Walk with GraceThroughout the past four years and even with Dawn's new diagnosis, Dawn and Greg have walked with grace, joy and dignity. Their positive spirit and giving nature is constant. Their story is not about cancer or the incredible odds facing a couple battling cancer together at the same time. Their story is about how they have used their diagnosis to inspire others in similar situations and through it all spread the love of God. Instead of letting cancer control them, they used it for good and put the needs of others over their own. But now, they need our help. Help to continue their journey, as they face long chemo treatment protocols, staggering medical bills and the inability to work fulltime as they heal. Help to know that their friends and family stand next to them during this battle. Help to know that they don't have to face this fight alone. Please help Dawn and Greg Life is precious to Dawn and Greg as they watch their children and grandchildren grow and experience the awesome world God created. God, faith and family are at the center of their lives and they would love to be able to experience as much time with family and friends as God allows. The process of fighting Greg's cancer the past four years has severely impacted them financially, and the future costs of fighting two cancers at the same time are overwhelming. We are hoping to raise enough money to cover their ongoing medical costs and the loss of income from the inability to work fulltime, while both are being medically treated. All funds donated will go directly toward offsetting their expenses and allowing them to continue to fight.We are eternally grateful for your prayers and support! May God bless you.",122,511,11,131,3 months,4 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

While this was definitely scary news, our family was hopeful that the mass would turn out to be benign. Unfortunately, test results confirmed our worst fear...My 34-year-old brother had cancer. As devastating as this news was it was nothing compared to the news we received a week later. Stage IV with another mass found in his liver. Ryan is now in a literal fight for his life. He will begin chemo treatments this week followed by surgery soon after. As if that is not enough to worry about, he also has to worry about supporting his amazing wife, Coryne, and two beautiful children, 2 1/2 year old Preston and 10-month-old Noelle. Ryan’s treatments are going to make him extremely fatigued and weak. He will, therefore, be unable to perform at his job which is very physically demanding. Since he has not been at his new job long enough he will not be paid for time off and is not eligible for FMLA. This is where you come in. I would love to be able to help alleviate some of that financial burden for Ryan and his family. He should not have to worry about how he’s going to pay bills and feed his family while he should be focusing on beating this horrible disease. If you can give anything at all, please do.

Thank you for helping! The money raised for Crystal will go to medical expenses, including an air ambulance from Idaho Falls to Oakland. Crystal’s Mom, Michelle Castle, will be withdrawing any funds as the beneficiary of Crystal’s campaign. )Crystal, a healthy active 32 year old, suffered a major stroke Friday morning, May 18th, roughly 15 minutes after she arrived to work in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Any earlier she would of been driving or she could of been home where I wouldn’t of found her for hours. She was immediately taken via ambulance to the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center and after a 4.5 hour emergency surgery to attempt to remove a monster clot at the base of her left brain, they were unsuccessful. She was also put on a “clot buster” medicine to help break it down. We were finally able to see her hours later. She was able to lift and lower her left arm on command , squeeze our hand and tried to open her eyes. We had nothing but to believe she could hear us, feel us and that this would all be fine. Later on that evening around 1030pm her pupils changed to different sizes. They rushed her to get a CAT scan and noticed severe brain swelling that was compressing her spinal cord. At this point the neurologist recommended a craniectomy to remove the left side of her skull to relieve pressure. This would give her a chance to live with an unknown outcome of what would happen next. The doctors now believe the clot affected 90 percent of her left brain. So here we are, 5 days later. She’s now surrounded by family with more on the way. A lot of ups and downs. A lot of positives. A lot of negatives. A million unknowns. Every case is different. Every patient is different. Every outcome is different. And for those of us who know Crystal, she’s different. Strong. Stubborn. The feisty twin. And if anyone can fight, she will. I will say today wasn’t as scary as yesterday. But tomorrow has no promise. Crystal needs some help - we are asking for help! Any help. She is going to have unknown medical expenses along with a possible uninsured medical flight to get her back to CA to a hospital where we know she will get the absolute best of care. She more than likely never work again and will need years of physical and speech therapy. We moved here from Central California about 15 months ago when she accepted a new job. It’s just us out here. Shawna, her twin sister, is in Boise 4 hours away. All of our other friends and family and the biggest part of her support system are back in California and that’s our goal of where to get her. With that said, thanks for the help. It all helps. And not just the money, but the vibes, the well wishes, the prayers. We spent yesterday with some of her coworkers in ICU, reminiscing about the short time they knew her, talking about who she is, how she’s always right, how she always takes charge, how she never fails and how she isn’t going to fail this. We know she was listening to every bit of it.",231,1.3k,10,233,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

We were a surprise in each other’s lives. Loving each other has been erl we have known despite the adversaries of life. We travelled, we laughed, we married, and in 2016 brought into this world the boundless spirit of joy - our son Dylan. He’s almost two. On May 31st 2018 our world was shattered. We received the news that ken has pancreatic cancer ; metastasized to his liver and other surrounding soft tissue and vertebrae. The day before we were finalizing house plans for our new home and picking kitchen tiles with such excitement (Ken is a chef for over 20 years), our son had just recently started nursery and we’d just decided to start planning for baby  number 2.  Now we were facing the devastating possibility of worst case prognosis. We left our life in the Cayman Islands; and are now in the USA seeking treatment. We are ready to fight. We need to fight, We must fight. We believe we deserve our life together and we know that our baby deserves a life with his dad. We are uncertain of tomorrow but are certain our love can see us through-regardless. For any and all support that comes our way ; We thank you, We respect you , We are forever grateful to you. Ceili HeffernanFor all those who have graciously donated we wanted to let you know that we have made arrangements with my Aunt Gayle to receive the funds into her bank account on our behalf. She will then be able to ensure that we can then directly receive the money from her.  Because we are in the USA and this campaign was set up in the USA, only an American citizen with a bank account and residential address here can be set up to receive and withdraw from the Go fund me campaign. Of course we trust Aunt Gayle implicitly and will now be able to start using the money you have all sent us to start paying for our accommodation, food, transport, fees for our visas (to allow us to remain here for treatment), travel to obtain our visas, continued care for our son Dylan, and all the various costs arising due to Kens medical treatment. Kens doctor at Memorial Sloan Ketterin - Dr. Sharokni - has requested further scans to be done before a final decision is made on his complete treatment regime. We see him again on July 16th. This is when we will have a better picture of what's ahead. For now, Ken is doing ok. Managing symptoms with medication and we are finding moments to laugh in each day. Ken and I are both positive and are focused only on getting him better so we can get back home. Our baby boy is being flown back home tomorrow. We are distraught but know that it is the best decision for Dylan. This is no environment for him. He will be back at nursery next week and will hopefully find comfort in the familiar, even without us being there. We still do not know how long we will be here in the US, but the strain and fear of our lives being thrown into limbo, income for our family being effected during this time and the sudden increase of costs of all sorts; has been made bearable by the kindness, compassion and understanding of so many of our friends, family and even strangers. There is a lot of love in this world and its at times like these when it really shines. Much love Ceili & Ken",254,725,6,254,2 months,24 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She needs a procedure that is only offered in Mexico. Without our help, she won't be able to afford it because it needs to be paid for up front.  Let's rally to help this amazing, inspirational, loving, giving woman get to the finish line.Her daughter Haven wrote the following to give you more info:18 months after the initial diagnosis of my mom, she is still working 30 hour weeks at her desk, taking medications, attempting to stay healthy, visiting various doctors, and keeping a smile on her face as a walking miracle. It’s taken a toll on her body. The thing is, now her oncologist wants her to go through chemotherapy, which would have killed her last January before her 6-week prognosis. Exhaustion and pain keep her awake at night and tired during the day. She is anemic again despite blood infusions, and it’s nearly impossible to keep her on a diet that is both healthy and helps her gain weight. The next step is to achieve the goal Mom has had for a long while but never decided to pursue because of the cost—the Sanoviv clinic in Mexico. With aggressive and holistic treatments that are unavailable in the US, Sanoviv has a program to rebuild Mom and give her a future. However, that future costs $30,000, which is the same price as chemotherapy. The past year of medical bills, a college student, and regular life has left us searching for the money on trees. The donations here would be used to send my mom to the clinic in Mexico where she can taste the life we want her to have. She has come so far and I can’t stand the thought of not being able to give her this chance.  The support from our family and friends means more than I could ever convey.Sanoviv offers an abundant field of alternative, holistic and integrative breast cancer treatment options.

As long as she has no infections she will be home till mid September. Then she will be re-admitted for her stem cell transplant and round 4 of chemo. She has been stuck in her room the past couple weeks and will be again when she has to go back....so they have had to be really creative to keep her entertained.  They also had a repeat head MRI last week and saw no tumor!!! Please keep praying!7/5/18charlie is still in the hospital. The infection is clearing and today they did the first step of her stem cell transplant. They got great news that they may be able to go home for the weekend! Next round of chemo will start Monday.Updated 6/29/18The Matthews found out today that they are going to have to stay inpatient at the hospital for the next 3-4 weeks.  Charlie is on IV antibiotics that she will need for about a week.  After that they will be harvesting her stem cells, followed by 2 more weeks of chemo.  So they will be splitting their time to be with Charlie 24/7.  How you can help over this next difficult month:1. Visit them IF YOU ARE HEALTHY!  They love visitors to break up the day!2. If you are signed up for the meal train....it would be best for them to get prepared/hot food before (or close to) 5pm.  That way one of them can pick it up and bring it back to the hospital before Charlie goes to bed (you can also text Shelly and arrange to deliver it to the hospital, or you can have uber eats deliver it there...you would just have to let shelly know when to run down to pick it up from the uber driver. 3.  Donate:)4.  Let Shelly know if you (or someone you know) has breast milk that you can donate. Updated 6/27/18charlie got admitted yesterday to treat fever and  listlessness. They gave her some blood last night and she is doing much better today. They hope to be discharged after 48 hours. Please keep your prayers up! Updated 6/20/18The Matthews are home! Charlie completed round one of chemo like a champ! Everyone at the hospital was shocked at how well she handled it.  Been a little hard  for the whole family...living at the hospital with a new born, so they are so happy to be home for a week or so with the dogs and in their own beds. When Charlie’s labs look right they will be re-admitted to collect stem cells. They collect them no to use during later chemo infusions. Updated 6/14/18Charlie was admitted to hospital this week to start her chemo treatments.  They did some more testing and confirmed that she does not have cancer cells in her spinal cord!  This was great news.  She had her first dose of chemotherapy last night and is tolerating it well.  They plan to keep her in the hospital to continue this round of chemo until the end of the week.  Then she should be able to return home and do some treatments out-patient.  The plan is that every couple of months she will have to be admitted for the more intense chemo rounds.They are still waiting on the final pathology and genome results.   It will likely be several weeks before we know more, but regardless of the results the treatments for now are the same.  Back story:In late May, Charlie became sick and appeared to have an ear infection. She was seen again by her doctors when she became unsteady on her feet. After some studies, it was found that she had a brain tumor. She was immediately transferred to Rady Children's Hospital's PICU where the doctors  quickly removed the tumor and later determined it was cancerous.  Although we still don’t have the specifics, we are sure that Charlie has a long road of chemotherapy ahead of her in which she will be admitted to the hospital on and off over the next year or so. A week after her surgery, Charlie and her parents welcomed her baby brother Noland into the world.  He was born on May 29th and was a healthy 8 pounds 1 oz.  Noland is doing well, he is a good eater and sleeper.  This fund was set up to help with medical costs, travel costs, babysitting fees, house maintenance and basically anything that will help ease the stress for the Matthews family.  Our goal is to raise enough money so that Shelly does not have to go back to work until Charlie's 9months-1 year of treatments are over.  Many people have already donated directly to the Matthews. Blake and Shelly are beyond appreciative of everyone’s generosity. They have used some of what they have gotten so far to bank the baby’s stem cells as a possible therapy for Charlie.

She is in need of our support and prayers. Kiera is an amazing 8 year old little girl, and overall beautiful human being. She truly touches the lives of everyone she comes across. She is the kid that can make anyone smile or laugh even on their worst day. She just has a way of drawing you in with her beautiful personality. She loves school, reading, competing in chess tournaments, Jiu Jitsu, writing books, yarn crafting and making messes! In 2011, Kiera was diagnosed with a Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM). Due to a bleed in her brain, she lost feeling and the use of her lower left leg and foot overnight. At the time, surgery to remove the CCM was not an option. Based on the location of the CCM lesion, the surgery presented too many risks. After 3 months of physical therapy, hard work, and with the help of AFO braces (zoom shoes as she called them) to support her lower leg and foot, she was up and walking again. Her parents Jude and Aundrea Ciddio were blessed with several years of primarily focusing on strengthening her left leg and foot, and picking new colors for her zoom shoes of course.Unfortunately, by late 2016 she started having what she referred to as “tingles” in her left leg. By the spring of 2017 these “tingles” progressed to her leg falling asleep, and were later diagnosed as seizures. The seizures began to cause her to fall several times a day. One day at school, she experienced a seizure which caused a severe fall. She ended up with two black eyes and a huge bruise on her forehead. By the end of April 2017 and into May, she was only able to attend school for a few hours a day, and had to be escorted by mom or dad. By the end of June the seizures were increasing and nothing was helping. At the end of June, Kiera had her first overnight stay at UNM Hospital. After speaking with doctors, adjusting medication, etc., the seizures continued to get worse. They were not only happening 6-12 times during the day, but began occurring at night and disrupting her sleep. Anytime she would fall asleep she would be awoken by a seizure. After feeling helpless and scared for months, the family ended up at the ER for the 3rd time in a 10 day period. Kiera got to the point where she could not sleep without having seizure after seizure. The medication she was given was not helping with the severity or occurrence of the seizures. Kiera was finally admitted at UNM Hospital. Her seizures were so bad that an attempt for an MRI was unsuccessful. Instead, they had to do two CT scans. The results displayed signs of another bleed which was believed to be the cause of the seizures. They spent that night in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with little information as to why. They later found out she was so sedated there was risk and concern for respiratory issues; it was a long night to say the least. They spoke to the head of pediatric neurology, the neurosurgeon and various pediatric doctors who wanted to load her with antiepileptic drugs to try and break the seizures, while also discussing surgery to remove the CCM as well as associated risks. After 10 days at UNM, with seizures peaking at 50 per night, they finally made the decision to go home. They were not making progress at the hospital and the more drugs she was loaded with, the worse the side effects became. They were sure that surgery was going to be the only option. They prayed and hoped if they could just get home, maybe they could get her calm in her own element and get some rest before scheduling surgery. Our prayers were answered, and she was seizure free for over 5 months.At the end of December 2017, her “tingles” started to return and they tried to do all they could with medication to get ahead of it, but they are getting worse. After countless hours of research, Aundrea reached out to two neurosurgeons; one in Chicago and one in Colorado. She was able to schedule an appointment at the University of Chicago Medicine earlier this month. We have faith in this CCM specialist as he has done numerous surgeries. Kiera’s first airplane ride and out of state vacation was to fly out for advanced testing with a CCM specialist. After speaking with the doctor, it is now clear that medication is not going to be the answer and surgery is needed in order to control the seizures and give Kiera a better quality of life. So, in the next 60 days or so, Kiera will take her second plane ride to Chicago to have brain surgery and remove the CCM. Kiera, Aundrea, and Jude are expected to be in Chicago for at least two weeks. As you can imagine the cost of surgery, travel, housing, and time away from work is tremendous. At this time, they are not quite sure what kind of post-surgery rehab, medical costs, and follow-up appointments will be needed. Anyone that knows my sister and brother in-law, know that they are very private and asking for help is totally out of their element. No one wants to see their child sick or in pain, and when you add exorbitant medical costs to the mix, the situation can be extremely distressing. With that said, they need our help and prayers.

Medical,64,Lane Bailey Needs Our Help,https://www.gofundme.com/lane-bailey-needs-our-help,"FREDERICKSBURG, VA","August 29, 2018","$7,500","$30,250","If you know Lane Bailey, you're lucky. He's a man that truly knows no bounds to his love and nurturing.  He's loyal, he's brilliant, he's stoic, he's gentle, he's generous. Lane has dedicated his life to serving the people.  To serving the state of West Virginia.  But what you may not know, because he's kept it under wraps, is that he's dying. After struggling for almost a year+ to figure out exactly what was going on with Lane, he was finally diagnosed with MSA-C (Multiple Systems Atrophy), a rare form of Parkinson's affecting between 15,000 - 50,000 Americans. They aren't even 100% sure how to treat it as it doesn't respond to most forms of Parkinson's treatment.The list of hospital stays, procedures, treatments, and drugs is over a mile long.  He's been in ICU and on life support multiple times over the past 12 months, along with two extended stays in a rehab facility.  Lane is no longer mobile and wheelchair bound due to the MSA taking over his balance and coordination (the disease will eventually take over all motor function).  While he can get up from the chair to shuffle to another chair a few feet away, anything more will cause him to take a spill and result in injury.  The number of falls recently, resulting in blood and cuts and bruises, are too many to mention.  Lane has had to undergo a tracheotomy so that he can breath and eat normally, which comes with so many issues of its own (prone to pneumonia, fluid in the lungs, and extensive care). While he still has his voice and is finally able to breath on his own, it has been an uphill battle to get to this point.  Lane can no longer do anything on his own.  He has to have assistance for everything, and we mean EVERYTHING - from the minute he wakes up, until he goes to bed he requires assistance.  From getting dressed, to using the restroom, getting in/out of the bed, taking a shower, getting to/from the car, you name it.  All the things we take for granted, those normal everyday things, he needs help with.  If you know him, you know this is crushing his soul.  This man, this tall, wonderful, joyous man is no longer joyous.  His body is quitting on him and it is so unfair. So so unfair.  He knows he's dying, he knows there is still such a long road ahead, and he knows there isn't a thing he can do about it.  It cannot be stopped, there is no way to stop it. No treatments, no medicine, nothing.  It's just going to get worse.  The medical bills are out of control - currently ticking in at well over $50,000 not covered by any insurance.  The sheer amount of funds needed to help someone who is wheelchair bound is staggering - a new van had to be purchased, ramps for the house, retrofitting the bed and the bathroom to be handicap accessible, everything.  The cost of all of Lane's medicine is INSANE, costing he and Sharon over $2,000/month out of pocket (in addition to what is covered by Medicare).  The bills...the bills just won't stop.  His wife, who has dedicated her life to their family, must care for him 24/7, so she can't even take on work  And the system, the system he has worked so tirelessly to defend, can't help him.  So if you know Lane Bailey, you know this treasure of a human is sad.  He's defeated, he's lost, he's suffering, he's depressed, he and his wife are in a serious financial bind, and neither Lane or Sharon see light at this end of this tunnel.  Any help you could provide would be beyond generous of you and so appreciated it won't even be able to be expressed appropriately.  We don't know what else to do.  He and Sharon don't even know we're asking (and are most likely going to be mad when they find out). We don't know how to pay for all of this or even how to sustain it moving forward. It's awful, just so awful. Thank you for even taking the time to read his story and for even considering donating your hard earned money to this man. Just thank you.  All our Love,Megan (Lane's daughter-in-law), Andrew (Lane's son), Waverly & Bexley (Lane's special granddaughters).----------------------------------------For More Information on MSA: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Multiple-System-AtrophyTo Donate to the MSA Coalition:  https://www.multiplesystematrophy.org",120,316,0,118,4 days,2 hours ago,4 days,2018-09-03

Medical,64,Help My Dad Beat Leukemia,https://www.gofundme.com/help-my-dad-beat-leukemia,"GLEN COVE, NY","August 5, 2018","$50,000","$30,225","Hi, my name’s Meli Grant, and my dad, Michael, is fighting Leukemia. Basically he has cancer in his bone marrow. It’s called AML, or Acute Myeloid Leukemia. It started as MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome), which means that he has multiple chromosome abnormalities and as a result his bone marrow doesn’t produce cells properly. It results in a dangerously low blood count (super low energy), low platelets (he bleeds and bruises easily, and doesn’t heal well), and low white counts (most of us know what that means, but basically little things our bodies are really good at protecting us from can be a life or death situation for him). Ultimately, if untreated, it means losing my dad. Case and point, my dad spent nearly a month straight at Saint Francis Hospital on Long Island between their medical ICU and an isolated room where he’d be safe from infection after his cheek was hurting one night, and we discovered he had a fever over slices of pizza. Not exactly what we imagined life had in store for us when we ordered that night. At different intervals, he’s had a picc line in his arm, a port implanted in his chest, and the scariest one was a temporary line in the side of his neck that went straight to his heart so that he could receive blood and medicine in a timely manner. He spent multiple nights in an oxygen mask and when I wasn’t with him, I’d be home stress-drinking coffee until 5 in the morning. Happy we’re past that. Now for the good news. My dad has been very privileged to have fantastic healthcare courtesy of his job. He’s a high school teacher at Friends Academy, a Quaker private school on Long Island. He teaches stagecraft, working one on one with some amazing kids, and manages their theater. Before that he worked for over twenty years in professional theater in New York City. As a result of his great insurance, he’s had nearly everything covered thus far, and where we’ve run into unexpected bills, we’ve been able to challenge them and come out on top. The best news of all is that he’s in REMISSION!! We couldn’t be more grateful. So why is there a GoFundMe page then.Here’s the thing. He’s not cured until he’s had a stem cell transplant. This will involve another intense round of chemo, (another) full month in the hospital, and then two or three months more in a sterile environment somewhere within walking distance of the hospital (Memorial Sloan Kettering).Here’s where we’ve run into trouble.Housing is offered by MSK, but it’s very expensive. There’s a good chance we’ll have to pay up to $50,000, between housing and live-in aids. None of this is covered by insurance. This is how the numbers break down.     •       The housing option provided by the hospital works out to about $7500 a month. The social worker emphasized that some past patients have opted to rent a NYC apartment instead. ~$15000     •       He is required to have 24/7 supervision, in the event that something goes wrong, medical emergency or otherwise. This role can be filled by family members. That mostly comes down to me, but I live in Dallas and I’m already flying back and forth regularly for work. I’m going to be trying to fill as much of that time as I can. Hopefully as much as 50% of that time. Hiring an aid works out to about $25-30 an hour, 24 hours a day, which adds up in just a few months to: ~$20,000 - $30,000. If we are unable to meet this housing/supervision requirement, the hospital won’t do the procedure. We are expected to make a decision imminently, so we’re going forward with it, even if it means a lot of financial risk and instability. So the number above ($50,000) is a number that would take care of everything for us and provide us with some protection against unknowns. That would be incredible. What we are asking is if you want to donate to help us get through this, then whatever you donate would be welcome. No amount is too small. Any amount helps to reduce the financial burden and stress that it can cause my dad as he begins his new future cancer-free. If we hit our goal, we’re grateful, if we manage some of it, we’re grateful. And if we somehow wind up with more than we need, any excess will be donated to the hospitals that have taken such good care of him throughout this process, Saint Francis, Weill Cornell, Memorial Sloan Kettering. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.",188,400,3,193,29 days,1 day ago,-1,2018-09-03

At the end of January 2017 my father, Tom, was home recovering from a routine kidney stone operation. Walking back to bed from a midnight bathroom visit he lost consciousness and fell, waking up hours later face down and unable to move. Because my mother was away visiting family and I live out of town, there was no one home to help him or hear him call for help. He laid there for hours, immobilized and alone, unable to answer the phone when messages came in from my mom asking how he was doing and if he was alright. Worried he hadn’t responded, she managed to reach two family friends to go to the house and check up on him and finally, sixteen hours after falling, paramedics were called and he was taken to the hospital.     It was determined that the fall had caused severe whiplash that resulted in a torn ligament misaligning three vertebrae in his neck and compressing his spinal cord. Emergency surgery stabilized and reinforced his spinal column, but unfortunately even after the surgery he found he was paralyzed with no feeling or control of his body from the shoulders down. After months of intense physical and occupational therapy and more recovery at home he has progressed to the point where he has regained some feeling throughout his body and some control of his shoulders and arms, but still, control of his legs, feet, and hands remains out of reach. He also suffers from constant nerve pain and frequent spasms, common to spinal cord injuries.     My dad has always been a very active man, always working on his car, fixing things around the house, running his Hi-Fi repair shop, helping his friends out with their projects, and helping me out countless times when I found myself in a jam and didn’t have the mechanical experience to handle it. His days now consist of him lying in bed, or at best being put into his manual wheelchair, and passively watching TV or listening to music. He needs constant 24 hour support to perform even basic tasks like eating.      Tom has recently been approved by The Stem Cell Institute, a world leader in their field of stem cell research and therapy, for treatment in August in Panama City, Panama. Unfortunately, this treatment isn’t yet available in the United States and requires travelling abroad. Scans taken before and after the injury as well as months into his recovery show that his spinal cord wasn’t torn or severed, only bruised and swollen. These scans were reviewed by the institute’s team of doctors before accepting him. The stem cells they use will be collected from Tom’s bone marrow and obtained from umbilical cord and placental tissue donated by mothers after normal births. The Stem Cell Institute has had success in treating similar injuries, and when performed within two years of the original trauma they show an 83% chance of significant recovery.     The initial treatment costs $37,200 and so far we estimate that we’ll need $5,000 for travel for my dad and mother along with specialized accessible medical equipment and supplies. Tom’s medical care and has put extreme financial and personal strain on our family simply maintaining the status quo. We need help. Unfortunately his insurance will not cover this treatment.     I would like to personally express my gratitude for your consideration, and especially for the wonderful help and support already given by so many of Dad’s friends and family.Thank you.Max",130,374,2,130,2 months,6 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

KC has been a chronic sleepwalker for his entire adult life and even sometimes slept in a hammock to limit his unconscious activity. He fell from a 3rd story window to pavement and landed on the left side of his face. He was found at 3am by the paperboy; no one knows how long he was lying there. He was chilled and moaning in pain but could not respond to requests to verify control of his arms and legs.He has many fractured ribs, a punctured lung, injuries to the lower spine, spleen, and kidneys. The lumbar spine is misaligned and impinging a very small amount on his spinal cord. Worst of all, the impact was just above his left ear, smashed part of his eye orbit, and damaged his brain. The trauma team at Good Samaritan worked hard to stabilize him and warm him up before emergency surgery to address the swelling in his brain. He's had two surgeries so far. First they added a drain to relieve pressure on his brain and a plastic surgeon reattached his left ear. A few hours later they had to remove a portion of his skull and part of his temporal lobe to make room for the swelling. He is in a medically induced coma to give him rest for healing and time for the swelling to go down. It generally takes 3-5 days for that to happen. He is currently stable but in critical condition in the ICU. Treating the other injuries is secondary to stabilization and getting the swelling down.The doctors say that he has youth on his side, and we all know he's a fighter ;-) KC's dog Bella is safe at his home with me. Our mother, my husband, and I are in town from Texas to be with KC.We are starting this fund to help with KC's needs during this time. You can follow KC's story here -  https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/kcmerrill. Thank you for your generosity and please keep my brother in your thoughts and prayers.",268,579,4,263,12 days,1 day ago,-1,2018-09-03

This news came as he and Lulu had recently celebrated their one-year wedding anniversary and welcomed their beautiful son, Theo.The outpour of support and well-wishes have been taken in with gratitude that they are surrounded by so many loved ones. A team of medical professionals is working hard to ensure that Ern is on track for a healthy recovery. A donation in any amount will be generous and gratefully accepted to support Ern, Lulu and Theo during this time and in the months ahead.

His intrepid spirit and determination have weathered one round of chemotherapy; he is currently recovering.8/14/18 UPDATE- Round two. Chemo is repeated every Monday. Side effects become milder with each administration. Blood tests show a positive response to the drugs! He essentially has no immune system and is susceptible to all sorts of infections. A very low White Cell count allows the body to regenerate itself and create new and healthy blood cells.

After attending the North Bennet St. School in Boston, Martin established his home and business as a historical restoration carpenter in Philadelphia.  Successful and driven, as a business owner of Seneca Historic, his life has revolved around his work. Last summer, Martin began experiencing severe symptoms - the most debilitating and alarming was pain, numbness and progressive atrophying of his right arm.  After numerous tests, doctors and lost revenue (his capacity to complete contracted projects was greatly compromised) he was finally diagnosed in Jan. 2018 with a Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST).  By this time, Martin had almost completely lost arm function. This rare, aggressive cancer has a poor prognosis and is incredibly challenging to treat.  Scans and a surgical biopsy revealed a large (MPNST) tumor embedded deep in his chest within the brachial plexus (important network of nerves).  MPNST's have a high rate of recurrence and metastasizing to other areas (commonly lungs). His diagnosis created an emergency as Martin became unable to continue his business and lost all ability to support himself.  Without family of his own in Philly, an urgent need for immediate treatment, and housing unsuitable for a seriously ill person; our mother left her Olympia, WA home to become Martin's full-time caretaker.  She found an adequate place for them to live together while forming a team with our brothers Ethan and Thom who left their homes in Seattle and Portland to help. Martin is receiving care from a team of specialists at Penn Medicine.  He is currently in his fifth round of brutal chemo infusions - an attempt to shrink spots presenting in his lungs which doctor's believe have a high likelihood of metastasis from the primary site of origin.  Martin will soon undergo an extensive surgery to amputate his right arm and shoulder to remove as much of the tumor as possible with radiation treatment to follow. At the beginning of this crisis our family pooled together financial resources to resolve his immediate needs.  However, after months of numerous expenses necessary to support a seriously ill cancer patient - medical bills, housing costs, transportation, food - our circle of family is becoming financially depleted. On Martin's behalf, I am requesting donations to relieve the urgent financial burden on my brother and his immediate caregivers.  Your donation will be greatly appreciated and wisely managed towards providing the following: housing, utilities, caregiving expenses, groceries, transportation and medical bills not covered by insurance/other sources.  With the total cost and scope of treatment impossible to predict, we have chosen the initial amount of $50,000 in hope that will be sufficient for the next year.  As Martin progresses through this difficult journey, we will update as his needs and expenses unfold.  Best wishes and regards, Martin's sister - Emilie.

That day will live in my memory forever, and my world was changed forever.  I think the entire world was changed forever because Aria’s personality and spark for life make the world a better place. She gives her family and everyone around her so much joy. Even in the midst of tremendous change over the last three years, Aria has been a shining star, always worried about how everyone else is doing. A few weeks ago, Aria had a sore stomach which led us to a GI specialist 3 times in one month, once to the ER and once to urgent care. They all gave us a clean bill of health but Megan and I felt something was wrong and insisted on a scan (also because I felt a weird bump on her abdomen).  We thought there might be an intestinal blockage, so were horrified when they told us there was a mass.  Over the first two weeks of March, they pieced together the shocking results that Aria has Stage 4 Neuroblastoma.   http://www.cncfhope.org/Home  There are approximately 700 cases of Neuroblastoma each year and over 100 of those are treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City.  We were referred to MSK by several sources and have now found hope and comfort.  While the cancer has spread to her bones, it has not spread to her lungs, liver or kidneys.  Aria started chemo on March 13 and, although it is hard to explain to her what is happening, she is such a brave girl.  We are in uncharted territory with this journey, but understand that it will be long, exhausting and expensive.  Our temporary second residence will be in NY since Aria’s treatment will last 8 to 12 months and she will be unable to fly home or take public transportation due to the risk of infection.  In addition to temporary housing in NY, I’ll be flying back and forth to be with Gabriella, who will stay in Georgia to minimize disruption to her life.  And I’m just beginning to get a glimpse of the many things beyond out-of-pocket medical expenses that will add up quickly – Uber/cab rides when walking is not an option, stroller, wigs, etc. We are grateful for your support and prayers!Daniel Lakier",195,610,4,189,5 months,7 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

I have never heard him say ""what about me?”   He always puts others before himself.  He is selfless.  A man that I have never seen cry has been so overwhelmed by emotions in just a few weeks - it breaks my heart!  I am proud to have Uncle Mike in my life and hope that I can be half the man he is one day.  HOW DID IT START?In September Uncle Mike noticed that his tummy was upset.  He thought it was from the stress and anxiety of losing his dad.   Then a week before Superbowl Sunday, Uncle Mike thought he had the flu because he wasn't feeling well.  It was Superbowl Sunday, although his team didn't win - he was excited that Philly won - since they never had a super bowl victory - he was even happier that the Eagles brought home a win to his family in Philly.  Anyone who knows Uncle Mike, knows that he loves sports!  You would think that he'd be jumping with joy that weekend- but uncle Mike was still not feeling well - so off he was to see the doctor on Wednesday;  he had blood work done in the morning and by the early evening, my nouna/aunt Gigi received a call from the doctor telling her to get uncle Mike to the hospital ""his liver enzymes are all over the place"".  Uncle Mike had CT Scans, MRIs, and blood tests to confirm that he had a tumor in the bile duct and malignant masses in the liver; more testing later revealed that the cancer had infiltrated the lymph nodes.Uncle Mike will begin chemotherapy and then radiation Y90 at University of Chicago.  Although at this point surgery is not an option for him, the goal is to hopefully have the tumor shrink so the doctor's can go in and resect - that means take it out.  We are hoping that in 3 months we see results - and results means shrinkage.  The doctors have explained that the process of chemo, radiation, scans and possible surgery could take up to 6 months!   HOW CAN YOU HELP?First and foremost PRAY!  It takes a village and I am respectfully asking that we all band together to help Uncle Mike.  Please pray and believe!  Uncle Mike has a beautiful six year old daughter who needs him around! My Aunt Gigi needs him.  My pappou needs him!  He takes such good care of my pappou!  His friends and family need him!  I need him! My Uncle Mike and Aunt Gigi are proud people - It is very difficult for them to ask for  help - but my Aunt Gigi, Uncle Mike and Cousin Gabriella are going through a difficult time.  The medical expenses, pharmacy expenses, travel expenses, nutrition expenses and just basic living expenses are becoming too much!   That is why I am asking for help on their behalf.  Please find it in your heart to show compassion, selflessness and generosity - Please help my family - the medical bills have started to come in - and although, yes, they do have insurance - it does not cover all the costs.  “Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed.”   GandhiThank you!",172,697,17,171,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,66,Saeideh’s Emergency Fund,https://www.gofundme.com/HelpSaeideh,"ENCINO, CA","March 22, 2018","$200,000","$29,849","￼On Wednesday February 28th, my mom Saeideh Hosseini, was admitted to the ICU...and within several short hours, mom experienced multi organ failure, ultimately leading to a double leg amputation.  That was the third time in 4 days she had been to the emergency room. Since the symptoms she was having were similar to those of a bad case of the cold or flu, she had been sent home the first two times. This time was different as her symptoms were very severe. That night the doctor told us that it wasn’t looking good and that I should go and kiss her goodbye...hearing this and seeing someone who is usually so full of life and laughter in a coma was a huge heartbreak for me, my family, friends, and loved ones who have been so supportive. We were told the multi-organ failure was due to a virus that had attacked the heart. No one has been able to tell us what strain of virus caused this, only that unfortunately for Saeideh, not only was the heart failing, but also her lungs, kidneys, and liver were failing as well. The doctors surgically placed a device called the IMPELA to help her heart continue pumping. Meanwhile, Saeideh needed dialysis machine to help with the kidney failure and also another device called  ECMO to help clean and oxygenate her blood. That’s when we got her transferred to the ICU unit at UCLA where she is still today. The team of doctors and nurses here have been working diligently to help my mom recover and  finally after days of being in a coma, she is awake. Her heart is beating on its own which is a miracle since on several occasions we were told that her chances of surviving this were 5%-10%! We were also warned that there may be brain damage and wheel chair confinement.  Mom is fully functional mentally and has no brain damage. My mom has always been and always will be a very strong independent woman. I am sure with time she will move around on her own. Unfortunately, all the medicine and medical devices used to keep her alive are not without side effects... During this time, the blood pressure medication and the devices in her groins caused poor blood flow to her lower legs which led to her having both legs amputated.Overall my mom is dealing with this better than we thought. She is stronger and braver than any of us knew, she truly is an optimist.  She keeps a smile on her face, regardless of the discomfort and pain of being in a hospital bed. The doctors and nurses are always commenting about how pleasant and nice she is. She has earned the title of the “Most Popular Patient” of the ICU. I want to thank everyone who has been supportive of us during this horrible ordeal. We are grateful for your prayers and we know that Saeideh being alive today is a divine gift and miracle!  Mom’s road to recovery is long and expensive. And she does not have much insurance coverage. So her recovery, rehab, medications will be prohibitively expensive. And thus, we ask you to be an angel and help if you can. Any amount will be appreciated and will go a long way.

Doctors administered strong antibiotics and after 5 days, Carson was released back home with a prescription for daily antibiotic infusions for 4-weeks. Carson rested and received his daily infusions; however, he continued to struggle with worsening symptoms and dropping blood oxygen levels. On Friday, July 20th, Carson's parents brought him back to Saint Mary's ER where he was admitted once again. The following Monday, July 23rd, doctors determined the source of Carson's pneumonia to be a fungal infection called blastomycosis. While not uncommon, the complications Carson has experienced with this infection have been described as 1 in a million. The infection wreaked havoc on his lungs. He was eventually placed on a ventilator, but his lungs continued to fail and on Tuesday, July 24th the decision was made to place him on a heart and lung bypass machine (life support) called Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation or ECMO. This machine takes the carbon dioxide rich blood from Carson's body, removes the carbon dioxide, then oxygenates the blood and returns it to his body. Carson has been on ECMO since. His progress will be measured by weekly rather than daily progress. His mom, dad, and sister have been by his side through this journey.And, his journey will be difficult and arduous. It is not clear how long Carson will be connected to ECMO. It may be weeks or months. Since being placed on a ventilator, and eventually ECMO, Carson has been in a medically induced coma so his body can rest and heal.He has begun be to be awakened and we pray his recovery continues in this positive trajectory. Please join us in prayer for complete healing and a powerful recovery process. Pray that Carson's emotional, mental, and spiritual life will flourish even as he faces intense difficulties. Pray for strength for Carson and his family.The goal of this fundraiser is $50,000, but as you can imagine, the cost of medical care Carson requires will far exceed this mark. Our hope is that during Carson's recovery he will not have to worry about finances.  Carson has committed his life in service to others through ministry. His love for people is evident in his compassionate presence and engaging spirit. Now, it is our turn to bless Carson.

He passed away Tuesday morning. I am grateful he is no longer in pain, and I hope he was not too frightened in the end and knows how much I loved him. Thank you and much love to everyone that has helped us over these past three months.

There are times in our lives when we need help, and, for us, this is one of those times. My husband, David, has Stage IV oral cancer. After visiting and speaking with several oncologists, we found out that traditional treatments are not an option for him. David also has an autoimmune disease (dermatomyositis) that requires him to take strong immunosuppressant drugs to keep his own immune system from destroying his muscles and connective tissues. Because of these medications, the doctors told him that chemotherapy and radiation were not an option, as these treatments would kill him quickly. Being someone who does not heal quickly and is easily prone to infection because of the medications he takes, the extreme surgery (the removal of half of his face, including bones) was also not an option. 

So, we began researching holistic alternative treatments and started them within two weeks of his diagnosis. However, insurance won’t have anything to do with these treatments and five weeks in, we are already almost $10,000 out of pocket. We have at least 8 more weeks of the protocol left and then maintenance doses to continue after he is done.

David is a strong man and a hard worker, who believes in living life to its fullest. He owns and runs his own small business, which we are trying to keep going through all of this so that he has something to focus on other than his health and so that we can continue to have some of his income coming in. Obviously, his hours have been cut way back and even in those he works, his strength and stamina is not what it usually is. He will likely lose some clients over this, but hopefully not his business. I have to constantly remind him that his life is more important. 

Outside of work, you will rarely find him sitting still. He is always working on something, helping someone out, or going out to socialize with friends. He is not one to ask for help, but always one to offer it. We have plans to travel together, and the one thing he said when he got this diagnosis was that he wants to make it long enough to go on the trip we have already planned and paid for this summer to Portugal and Spain. 

I have hopes that he will make it much longer than that, and that, maybe, once we have kicked this cancer’s butt, we can use some of these alternative treatments to cure or at least slow his autoimmune disease and get rid of some of these immunosuppressant medications that probably caused this cancer to progress so quickly that it was already a late stage cancer by the time we caught it. Mainly, I have high hopes to continue living my life with my husband and our pupsters, Chili and Toby. We have known each other since we were 9 and 10 years old. We have been together as a couple for over 20 years, and have been married for 18 of those years. We have a life full of love, laughter, and adventure, and I’m not ready to give that up. He’s not ready to give that up. So thank you for whatever help you can give. Your generosity and caring is truly humbling to us.",175,992,3,171,4 months,2 months ago,2 months,2018-09-03

Recently my friend, Farokh (aka Rokhy) Emami was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer at the age of 45. She was fortunate to find the tumor early herself and despite her doctor’s repeated assurances and even a negative mammogram, she insisted on an MRI which her insurance would not and did not cover. Thank goodness for her persistence! You see, this wasn’t the first time cancer had knocked on her door. Her only child, a daughter now a teenager, was diagnosed with retinoblastoma (a rare cancer of the eye) at the age of one. At that time, she and her daughter moved to the US and started cancer treatment at CHLA. With generous help and support from her brother, she spent months at her toddler daughter’s bedside at the hospital. Countless follow up visits, treatments, scans, ER visits, and multiple hospitalizations ensued in the next couple of years. Although, her little girl recovered, the doctors told mom that with childhood cancer, there was an increased chance of recurrence within 10 years. Dreadfully, at the age of 11, the cancer was back, this time in the form of leukemia. At that time, there was no immediate family left to help and support them. Both my friend’s parents were deceased and both siblings living were in other parts of the world. Nevertheless, this strong and extraordinary mother and daughter duo persisted as they embarked on yet another grueling round of chemotherapy treatments, prolonged hospitalizations at CHOC, countless tests, and at times devastating medical set backs until the cancer thankfully went into remission. Life continued and this mother and daughter thrived as years passed. Not too long ago, my friend posted on Facebook that her daughter had just passed her 5-year cancer free mark. A sigh of relief as this time, it had appeared that the cancer was not coming back. Little did anyone know that as the duo were preparing for high school graduation and prom, cancer was coming back into their lives for a third time, but this time for a different target - the Mom. Since this devastating diagnosis in February of this year, this amazing mother and daughter have stood strong fighting this disease with minimal help from family and friends. Chemotherapy treatments are scheduled for every other Thursday. I don’t know how, but somehow this strong woman has been undergoing her chemo treatments every other Thursday while incredibly resuming her job on the following Monday after each treatment. However, after the 3rd chemo, of the total 8 treatments, her body grew weaker and it become more difficult to gain back her energy and recuperate. After the 4th treatment recently, she developed sores on the bottom of her feet that make it painful for her to walk and drive. Needless to say, she has had to stop working until she completes the remaining 4 treatments and the recommended two months of radiation that must ensue. Meanwhile, the bills are piling up and the financial resources are almost depleted. The primary focus of anybody fighting any debilitating disease, such as cancer and alike, should be recovery and healing, but that’s difficult to do when you are burdened financially. Prayers and positive energy go along way, but reality is that she needs financial assistance as she hopefully beats the cancer and gets back on her feet, both literally and figuratively. My friend is a typical strong, prideful and resilient woman and a single mom who is used to handling all that lives throws at her on her own. This time though, it’s different and although she has somehow managed thus far, I would like to lessen her burden just a little by raising enough funds to cover at least four months of her and her daughter’s living expenses until such time that the treatments are over and she can return to work. The goal is to raise $10,000 by end of June for her remaining 4 months of treatment and recovery. Please know that every little bit helps. Please open your hearts and your pocketbooks to donate whatever amount you can spare and donate Anonymously if you’re more comfortable. For those of you who know me well, you know that I don’t hesitate to help those in need when I can. This time though, I need you to help another fellow single mother as she fights this awful disease for the third time. Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign and for your kind & thoughtful donations. Arshia Mardasi",278,645,0,286,2 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

The generosity and outreach has provided a much needed source of encouragement during this immensely difficult time. The past few weeks have been challenging, and new developments have emerged as it relates to Dana's treatment. Because of this, we have increased our stretch goal to $40,000. Doctors have confirmed that Dana will need to receive a bone marrow transplant with a pre-treatment plan that includes radiation. The potential of infertility following radiation is very high. Doctors are encouraging Dana to harvest her eggs prior to the procedure, so she can still maintain the possibility of bearing children in the future. Additionally, she will need 24 hour in-home care following the transplant, for at least one month. The mounting expenses include the following:- Medical bills- A need for fresh food between treatments- A service to sterilize her apartment before she returns home from each treatment (chemo and transplant)- Fertility treatment and egg harvesting- 24 hour in-home careThank you again to those who have donated. If you are unable to contribute again, please consider sharing this link to help spread the word.  Again, your generosity and support is so encouraging. Thank you.Original post below:Our best friend, daughter, sister, niece and ray of sunshine, Dana, was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) in June of this year. She has begun a very aggressive regimen of chemotherapy, which has been difficult. The goal is for Dana to undergo a bone marrow transplant.If you’ve had the good fortune of meeting Dana, then you know Dana is an incredible person with an indomitable spirit. If you're reading this, chances are Dana has helped you or been there for you at some point in the past. Dana is a force -  she is one of a kind, she's the best friend you'll ever have, and we love her beyond belief.If you don't know Dana, you know us and our families. We wouldn't be who we are without Dana in our lives. She's extremely special to us, and by extension we hope that makes her special to you. It is not Dana’s style to ask for help, so we are asking on her behalf in the form of this fundraising effort. This is a favor for me as much as it is for her.A lot of people have reached out asking how they can help support Dana, and this is it. We'll be using the funds raised to cover medical costs and to supply healthy fresh food for Dana as she delves deeper in to treatment and prepares for her bone marrow transplant. This is the most tangible way to support Dana. Our starting goal is $20k, which will cover Dana's meals for several months. It would be an incredible start. If we can reach just 1000 friends & family who donated $20, we'd accomplish our first fundraising goal. Additional funds will continue to relieve the unexpected and certain costs that will arise throughout the remainder of her treatment and her reentry back into her normal, healthy life. Please help us make a difference in the life of a friend who brightens the soul of any person with good enough fortune to know her. More details on Dana’s diagnosis are as follows:On June 7th, 2018 Dana was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia affecting her T-cells. Upon receiving her diagnosis, Dana immediately began an aggressive regimen of Chemotherapy. This specific treatment calls for a month of in-patient treatment, which Dana has completed, followed by an additional 7 months of chemotherapy. After completing the first round of chemo, Dana faced major complications and the doctors deemed a bone marrow transplant necessary. The transplant will be performed once Dana is healthy enough to receive. The biggest concern with this type of treatment is Dana’s compromised immune system, which makes her susceptible to a myriad of bacterias and viruses that our healthy bodies easily avoid. This has made her journey particularly difficult and has resulted in elongated and unexpected hospital stays. We appreciate your love and support.

Unfortunately Ray faces a lengthy period of additional treatment and recovery during which he will be unable to work. This GoFundMe drive will raise funds that will go directly into a dedicated trust account to help Ray with his living expenses and other financial needs.On March 11th , following several weeks of recurring headaches and nausea, Ray went to the UVM Medical Center in Burlington VT where a scan revealed a significant mass near his brain stem. The following day he was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and underwent a 12 hour surgery on March 16th. The tumor was determined to be a type called ependymoma. Follow-on treatment to reduce any chance of recurrence will be four weeks of daily radiation therapy which will begin sometime in late April. The prognosis for his full recovery is good.In addition to his musical performances, Ray also works as a carpenter to help pay the bills. It is unclear how soon Ray will be able to return to work in either of these fields; at the very least it will be several months. In addition to uncovered medical costs, he needs help with living expenses, travel costs for his radiation treatments and other costs associated with recovery and rehabilitation. Bandmates from TAB and other groups are organizing benefit shows and t-shirt sales to raise money, and local friends and neighbors are pitching in to help him. This online funding drive provides another way for folks near and far who have been touched by his music to make a contribution. Ray is looking forward to getting back out to play for everyone as soon as possible, and our financial contributions will allow him to concentrate on getting better without the added burden of financial distress. We are setting a initial goal of $30,000 to provide Ray financial security during this time. Any contribution is greatly appreciated no matter what size.About the organizer: I am a friend of Ray's and live near him in Vermont. I offered to manage this page to make it easier for people to donate to his trust account so that Ray and his family can concentrate on his recovery.

Background: On September 14th, 2017, Laura Lee gave birth to her and Ryan’s beautiful daughter. Laura Lee had an emergency C-section with breathing complications, and was immediately diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy (heart failure caused by or induced by pregnancy. It’s a rare diagnosis that impacts ~1,000+ women in the US per year.) This diagnoses has led to several emergency room visits during her regular course of treatment, an ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) implanted in March 2018 replacing the life vest she was temporarily wearing, and an intravenous medicine pump implanted in July 2018 to automatically distribute medicine into her body.In June 2018, it was confirmed that Laura Lee's heart failure is preexisting and was induced by her pregnancy. She was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (an enlargement of the left ventricle) with signs of noncompaction cardiomyopathy (pockets formed in the walls of the left ventricle). After further testing, signs of a leaking mitral valve was found and heart failure started to form in her right ventricle. Her condition was deemed incurable through regular medical therapy.  In the near future: In order to receive a heart sooner than later, Laura Lee will move from St Paul, Minnesota to Scottsdale, Arizona for her surgery at the Mayo Clinic. She is anticipated to be in Arizona for 4-5 months while on the waitlist and undergoing her 90-day course of treatment post-surgery. Laura Lee’s husband Ryan and her parents will rotate as her caregivers while also managing the care of her children (daughter Lindy Lu, 10 months and stepson Ezra, 8 years) who will continue to live in Minnesota. With gratefulness from Laura Lee and her family, we are asking for any donations, thoughts, prayers, and love during this time. Because of the travel expenses for her and her family flying back and forth from Minnesota and Arizona, the reduced income for Laura Lee and Ryan who will both take time off work, on top of caring and providing for their children, all support is incredibly appreciated.A note from Laura Lee:  “ ❤️Heart Transplant❤️ Many thoughts come to mind when first said: fear, danger, risk, uncertainty, death. But when it becomes your cure, the negativity subsides and beauty shines through. It becomes a miracle procedure, a chance to say ‘not yet’, to feel normal, to be able to spend more time with my husband and loved ones, to see my babies grow, to save my life.”",309,1.0k,19,314,1 month,4 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Grosvenor Jr. I'm 42 years-young, a proud husband, brother, son and father to 6 wonderful kids. Unfortunately, for the past few years I've been battling a rare lung disease called Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, or IPF. IPF is idiopathic meaning a condition which arises spontaneously or for which the cause is unknown. I have never smoked or done any type of illegal drugs. In 2015 I was diagnosed with IPF, sadly the survival rate from diagnosis is 3 to 5 years. From that time, I was placed on a medication used to slow the progression of the disease. There is no cure for IPF, it is terminal. I was referred to University Medical transplant center in San Antonio to be evaluated for a double lung transplant since that is my only option for survival. I have been visiting the transplant center since then to monitor the progression of my disease. On June 18, 2017 I was placed on supplemental oxygen 24 hours a day. In May on Mother’s Day I was hospitalized for a week for RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) although rough I was able to recover and return to work. Then on July 1st, Heather took me to the emergency room and I was hospitalized again for a week but that time with pneumonia. Unfortunately, during that admission Heather and I were informed that I was in end-stage lung disease and we should move forward with getting listed for a double lung transplant ASAP. I have not been able to bounce back from the pneumonia and haven’t been able to return to work since the end of June. I got out of the hospital in the beginning of July and we have been traveling to San Antonio almost daily for testing, bloodwork, classes and procedures to be cleared for the transplant list. After years of battling this disease, several hospitalizations, a lung biopsy, being on oxygen for over a year and now using a wheel chair to get around we have encouraging news. As of Friday August 10th, our 11th wedding anniversary, I was officially listed for a double lung transplant. Now we wait for a phone call telling us it is time and to report to the transplant center in a matter of hours.  I take a regimen of medications and breathing treatments to attempt to give me some relief but as of my most recent spirometry appointment my lung capacity has deteriorated to just 36%.One of the many requirements in determining eligibility of a lung transplant is that I have a care provider that attends all appointments with me. Once I receive my new lungs I will be required to attend weekly transplant clinic appointments at the University Transplant Center in San Antonio to check my anti-rejection medication levels, other blood levels, to have bronchoscopies, pulmonary functions tests and doctors visits for the first 3 months following the transplant after that I will be required to attend these appointments biweekly/monthly for a year. As my caregiver Heather will be required to attend all these appointments with me. Which means we will need childcare for our 5 younger kiddos Gabi 9, Nathan 7, Maya 5, Julia 2 and Jonathan 2. I will be out of work for 6-12 months, and on and on. This is where the GO FUND ME comes into play.  All money raised will go toward travel expenses, childcare, and medical expenses related to my transplant.  Heather will not be able to work for 3 months following the transplant. She will be required to be with me 24 hours a day 7 days a week as my caregiver, this is a requirement by the transplant center. There are so many other costs associated with the surgery that don't get covered by insurance. Double Lung Transplant is not without its risks and its financial burdens.  After transplant l will be in the ICU and then later in the hospital doing rehab for up to several weeks. I am fortunate to live about 2 hours away from the University transplant center. University Transplant Center is one of the best facilities anywhere to perform the operation.  These funds will afford us the opportunity to focus on recovery, family and getting thru this tough time. I am incredibly motivated to survive this--my goal is for Heather and I to watch our 6 kids grow up and to be as active in their lives as possible. We appreciate all the prayers, good thoughts, and encouraging words from all our family, friends and church family. Thank you for reading my story and thank you for your help. I look forward to sharing my progress with you and posting pictures of me after I recover from the surgery. Thank youRay, Heather, Ray III, Gabi, Nathan, Maya, Julia and JonathanPlease feel free to ask any questions about our family or my condition. Please share this with everyone on your social media pages and ask THEM to donate and share as well--the more people who see this, the better our chances of hitting our goal.",218,880,5,215,19 days,10 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

In February, Ollie underwent a lifesaving tracheotomy and now depends on a vent to support his lungs. While Oliver uses a vent to breathe, he also requires the use of four other devices (oxygen tank, a cough assist machine, suction and a nebulizer) for daily living.  ￼￼￼￼These machines are heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to use which makes it almost impossible to leave home or travel.

The amazing people at Ventec,  www.venteclife.com have developed VOCSN, a innovative machine that incorporates all therapies into one lightweight, streamlined, portable device. A combined 55lb shrunk down to a portable 18lb!

She loved the Easter bunny and walked around picking up colorful plastic eggs and eating raw carrots that the Bunny's helpers had set out for children. She went down the slide with help and was practicing climbing the steps with help.On April 2, 2018 her school daycare told her mom when she was picked up that day that her left leg was ""bowed"" (hyper-extended) and she seemed to be dragging her left foot. Ellie saw her pediatrician on Wednesday April 4th and they wanted either a neurologist or orthopedist to take a look at her. She saw a neurologist on Monday April 9th and she did not think it was a neurological problem, so she squeezed her into the orthopedist that day. The orthopedist took an x-ray of her knee and didn't see anything and told them to come back in a week. On Wednesday April 18th, Ellie went back to a different orthopedist at that office and they said that it was probably nothing. That Ellie should come back in 6 months if she still wasn’t walking and there was no reason to waste money on PT.Ellie's parents were not satisfied with waiting 6 months and definitely thought PT would help. At this point Ellie was only walking when assisted. On Friday, April 20th, Jill took Ellie to her pediatrician and asked to get a CBC done. They also did blood work for inflammatory markers. All the blood work came back normal.  On Sunday April 22, Their neighbor Cindy who is a pediatric PT professor at MUSC came over to evaluate Ellie.  She definitely said not to wait 6 months. She may have felt some clonus in Ellie's left foot. Ellie was 17 months old.On Tuesday, April 24th, Jill and Chris called Shriners in Greenville, SC and explained Ellie's situation. Shriners called back the next day and said they would see Ellie on Friday, April 27th. Shriners did more x-rays of Ellie's spine and full right and left leg. All looked ok. They also did another CBC and lead test as well as additional bloodwork. They ordered an MRI of the brain, upper back, lumbar, etc... By the end of April, Ellie was no longer walking, standing or crawling. On May 1st Ellie started PT. On May 3rd was Ellie's MRI under general anesthesia. On May 4, 2018 at 8:30am, Shriners called and said there were spots on Ellie's brain. Chris, Jill and Ellie's lives were changed forever. Later that afternoon the neurologist from MUSC called and they heard the term Leukodystrophy for the first time.  They are waiting on the blood work from the geneticist to determine which type of leukodystrophy Ellie has.On May 14th, Ellie was fitted with braces so that she might be able to stand or maybe walk again. Ellie is also having a difficult time sitting up now. Chris, Jill and Ellie are now waiting on genetic results so they can see the best Leuko doctor in the United States at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. They are possibly going to CHOP on June 14th, but may have to push it back to wait for the many genetic test results that they have yet to receive. This is so frustrating and sad for all as Ellie is also having symptoms in her hands and it is getting harder for her to hold her drinking cup. Ellie does not sleep well since she cannot rollover or change positions which means her mom and dad do not sleep well either. At this point there is no known cure for this disease. The possibility of Ellie continuing to regress and having a shorter life expectancy is a real possibility.  This is so devastating to Chris, Jill and everyone who loves this wonderful little girl. Ellie no longer goes to her school/daycare since it is so important for her to not get an illness with a high fever. Jill is no longer working full time hours as a dental hygienist since there are many doctor appointments and Ellie needs extra care at this time. Jill continues to work at Ravenel Family Dentistry part time and Chris continues his HVAC business. They have insurance , however there are many things that are not covered and both have missed and will continue to miss time from work as well as working fewer hours. They want the best there is for Ellie and are doing their best to do that and stop the progression of the disease.",270,1.2k,6,265,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,67,Trasplante de Riñón para Francisco,https://www.gofundme.com/un-nuevo-rinon-para-francisco,"MIAMI, FL","July 16, 2018","$275,000","$29,420","(ENGLISH BELOW) ¿Harías cualquier cosa para salvar la vida de tu Papá? Yo también. Y con tu ayuda, yo, con todo mi amor y disposición, le estaré dando mi riñón. Mi papá, Francisco Martínez, ha dedicado gran parte de su vida a servir a los demás. Es un hombre y médico extraordinario, lleno de bondad, quien hoy necesita de tu ayuda.  Mi papa fue diagnosticado con Enfermedad Renal en Etapa Terminal (ESDR, por sus siglas en inglés). Luego de agotar las opciones en Venezuela, hace 10 días, sus hijos decidimos traerlo a Miami para verse con un Nefrólogo para una segunda opinión. En efecto, el nefrólogo confirmó que mi papá necesita un trasplante de riñón lo antes posible.  Nos remitieron al equipo de trasplantes para comenzar con los arreglos, pero al informarles que no tenemos seguro, se negaron a iniciar el proceso ya que no contamos con $275,000 dólares para cubrir la cirugía y monitoreo post-trasplante. Entre llamadas telefónicas desesperadas, reuniones, y correos electrónicos para lograr encontrar una solución... Mi papá comenzó a mostrar síntomas graves de fallo renal.  Ayer fue ingresado por emergencia en el Jackson Memorial Hospital en Miami, Florida. Sus pruebas de laboratorio arrojaron niveles muy altos de potasio, lo que coloca su corazón en peligro inminente de infarto, y su cuerpo alcanzó un estado de acidosis alarmante. En términos simples, esto es lo que sucede cuando los riñones pierden su capacidad de funcionar,  y entonces los fluidos, químicos, y desechos comienzan a acumularse en la sangre, hasta llevar a la persona a una intoxicación que puede causar la muerte.  Debido a esto, se tuvo que iniciar diálisis de emergencia para estabilizarlo. Podrías pensar que esto es bueno... Pero las estadísticas muestran que los pacientes en diálisis viven menos de la mitad del tiempo que vivirían si fuesen trasplantados. Adicionalmente, los riñones regulan la tensión, ayudan en la creación de glóbulos rojos y otras funciones importantes, cosas que la diálisis no hace. Y cada vez que lo dializan, a pesar de que su sangre es filtrada y limpiada, su función renal empeora y su oportunidad para un trasplante exitoso disminuye. Mi papá es un hombre increíble, trabajador, dedicado y bondadoso. Quien lo conoce puede dar fe de ello. Ha dedicado su vida a servir a los demás, y lo ha hecho por puro amor y pasión a su carrera. Es apreciado y amado por todos los que se cruzan en su camino, y merece una segunda oportunidad para vivir. ¡Por favor, ayúdame a dársela! Así es como puedes ayudarnos: Donar - Cualquier monto, por más pequeño que parezca, ayuda… ¡y estaremos infinitamente agradecidos!  ***Si prefieres hacer una donación directa, favor contactarme a través de GoFundMe par darte distintas opciones.Compartir - ¡Esto es tan útil como donar! Por favor, ayúdanos a difundir la palabra…nunca se sabe quién puede cambiar la vida de mi Papá. Rezar - El poder de Dios no tiene límites.  Gracias infinitasssss!!!!! La familia Martinez Arends-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-. IN ENGLISH Would you do anything to save your Dad’s life?  Me too. And with your help, I will lovingly, happily, willingly give him my kidney.  My dad, Francisco Martinez, is an extraordinary man and doctor who has dedicated most of his life to help others. Today, he needs your help. My dad was diagnosed with End Stage Renal Disease (ESDR). After running out of options in Venezuela, his 2 daughters and son, decided my dad had to be seen by a Nephrologist in Miami to get a second opinion. The nephrologist indeed confirmed he needed a kidney transplant as soon as possible.  We were referred to the transplant team, but upon letting them know my dad has no insurance, they refused to even see him without proof of having $275,000 to cover transplant surgery and post-transplant treatment, money that we don’t have.  In between phone calls, meetings, and emails trying to find a solution, my dad began to display severe symptoms of kidney failure. Yesterday, my dad was admitted by emergency to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida. His lab tests showed very high levels of potassium, which places his heart in imminent danger for a heart attack, and his body reached a life-threatening state of acidosis. In simple terms, this is what happens when kidneys lose their ability to function correctly, so fluids, chemicals, and waste products build up in the bloodstream leading to death. Because of this condition, doctors started my dad on an emergency dialysis to stabilize him.  You’d think this is good… But statistics show that Dialysis patients live less than half as long as transplant patients (see chart above). Moreover, kidneys help regulate blood pressure, create red blood cells and other important functions, which dialysis doesn't do. And every time he is dialyzed, even though his blood is being cleansed, his kidney function actually worsens, and his shot for a successful transplant diminishes.  My Dad is an incredible man. He has devoted his life to serving others, and has done it out of pure love and passion for his profession. He is cherished and loved by all who cross his path, and deserves another shot at life. Please help me give it to him!! Here’s how you can help us:  Donate – Anything, literally ANYTHING helps, and we are DEEPLY grateful! If you prefer a direct donation, please contact me through GoFundMe for options. Share – This is as much helpful as donating! Please help us spread the word. You never know who may be able to change my Dad’s life. Pray – The power of God knows no boundaries.Thank you.The Martinez Arends Family",454,1.2k,3,445,1 month,9 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

For those of you that do not know Suzanne, she lives in Brooklyn with her husband and nine year old daughter, Sophia. She is a talented Scenic Artist with vast experience in film, television and theater. Besides being known for her talents professionally as a long standing member of Local USA 829 she is also a talented icon painter with her work commissioned by various churches in America and abroad. Suzanne's experience and creativity are surpassed only by her unique spirit, enthusiasm and strength. It was this strength that enabled her to fight breast cancer when she was diagnosed in 2015, and to be declared cancer free in 2016. Suzanne was in remission for two years, until unfortunately, her cancer returned. This time it has spread to her brain. Suzanne is determined to defeat the cancer again; she has been undergoing Radiation, Chemotherapy, Immunotherapy, and other life saving treatments. This has been taxing physically, mentally, and financially as she is unable to work. We want to do all we can in helping Suzanne get through this difficult time and overcome this horrific disease.

Grant is 21 years old and lives on the Southside of Chicago. He attended St. Cajetan’s Grade School and St. Laurence High School and prior to the diagnosis he was attending College and working at local paint shop.Grant's journey to his diagnosis started in early Winter of 2017. He wasn't feeling well and was forced to reduce his work hours and eventually stop working all together due to what he thought was severe pneumonia. Due to having no health insurance, Grant was visiting various clinics to try and get better. After a handful of visits and multiple antibiotics, one clinic suggested he get a chest X-ray. The results of the X-ray showed something more than pneumonia and they suggested he go to the Emergency Room.After arriving at the Emergency Room, Grant was quickly diagnosed with cancer and multiple scans revealed he had a large tumor located in the center of his chest cavity and one lung was completed deflated. This all contributed to Grant’s severe cough and loss of weight that led him to clinic in the first place.Due to the aggressive nature of the cancer, the doctors insisted Grant start chemotherapy immediately. Within a week, he started a 5 day, 24-hour chemo treatment in the hospital. Since his first treatment, Grant has had many complications and additional hospital visits. Although the tumor was shrinking, it caused complications by creating a hole in his esophagus. Due to the hole in the esophagus, Grant has had to endure multiple procedures and surgeries which ultimately led to the insertion of a gastrointestinal feeding tube in his stomach.Grant is currently still going through chemo treatments and managing the hole in his esophagus which makes it extremely difficult for him to breath and talk. Luckily, through all of this, Grant’s mother, Elizabeth (Lisa) Grant has had to stay with him and give him the 24-hour care that he needs, but at great sacrifice. As a single-mother, she is unable to work because Grant needs to constant care. Due to extreme weight loss and low oxygen levels, Grant is unable to care for himself even in the comfort of his own home. Even the walk from his bed to the bathroom is exhausting.We hope with this GoFundMe, we will be able to help offset some of the daily costs associated with Grant’s care. This will include medical bills, cell phone bill, gas to and from the hospital, feeding tube supplies, medical products, and just general costs to ensure that Grant always has a house to come home to after his hospital stays.Please feel free share this with family, friends, co-workers, or strangers! Any little bit will help Grant and his family conquer this challenge! On the behalf of his family, we thank you for visiting this page and thank you for your generous donation!

She’s kind, patient, selfless, always willing to help, quiet at times but very sure of herself. She’s the love of my life and I don’t want anything in the world to hurt her. This disease is something she doesn’t deserve and it couldn’t have happened to a nicer, kinder person. She always puts our kids first, even during times like now when she’s struggling with fatigue, one of the many early symptoms she’s experiencing. She still finds the time to give her 100% to anyone who asks of her. All the people that know her have the utmost respect for her, I think that says a lot about a person. I love her with all my heart and want the best I can give her and we’re hoping this treatment is the best.” -Jon RapisuraWords from a husband who has so much love and determination to do anything for his wife. For those who know Aya Rapisura, Jon couldn’t be more precise; kind, patient, helpful, nicer person who loves her children. Unfortunately, today we are sharing with you some difficult news. Aya has recently been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Imagine living your every day life as a wife and mother, getting yourself ready for work and the kids ready for school, drive to the market, playing at the park, making dinner. Then one day, it all stops. It disappears and may never be that way ever again. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain, and between the brain and body. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50. The Dealing of the Cards:January of 2018 Aya was experiencing numbness on the side of her face which spread to other areas of her face. After an appointment with her personal physician no initial flags were raised. She initially put it off as nothing serious but towards the end of January the numbness continued, and tingling started in her hands and legs with fogginess in her thoughts. She started having difficulty driving and focusing. She began to forget things. A decision was finally made to go to the ER and that was the beginning of this journey. The same day that she went to the ER, she was admitted to the Hospital. Multiple tests were performed, MRI’s, MRI’s with contrast, Spinal fluid taps, Cat Scans, countless blood work…… At the end of the 2 days in the Hospital with multiple doctors it was 99.9% confirmed as MS. The diagnosis was heart breaking and we were dealt cards which we now must play with. At that time the results were that she had one small lesion in her brain but nothing else meaning this has been caught very early and we all thought “great! Early is a good thing.” After the initial kick in the gut feeling subsided it was time to do research and let us tell you we did research. The Prescribed Fix in America:The Neuro doctor, which is the same doctor that attended to Aya in the hospital is great. She and Aya have a good connection. The initial meeting after getting out of the hospital went well. She informed us of what was going on and what steps will be taken next. Another MRI was scheduled to see if any progression was made and a follow up appointment was scheduled.  The results of the MRI were reviewed during the follow up appointment with good news, No additional brain lesions and no movement on the existing brain lesion. However, the location in the brain where this lesion is affects sensations which is why she is having symptoms of numbness, tingling and brain fogginess.  From here we will be seeing another doctor who specializes in MS who was highly recommended by the Neuro doctor.Now the meds. Currently in the United States there is no “cure” for MS, only medication to slow the progress. There is no guarantee the meds will even work and with any medication there is side effects. Your given a whole pamphlet of meds to control/slow down MS progression and are told “choose one.” The Leap of Faith HSCT/Stem Cell:The internet can be a rabbit hole, once you go down that hole be sure when you look back you can still see light. Once you start the research it gets scary fast but you can’t stop looking, almost like when there is a car accident on the side of the road and you can’t look away. Some of the stories of people and their situations with MS is heart wrenching and some are inspirational. Were hoping we are the latter of the two…From what we know…. Medication will only slow down the disease, possibly, but it cannot stop the disease. Percentage of success varies from patient to patient, progress and speed of progression of the disease varies from patient to patient. Some people live years with out any major progression, some progress in 1 year. There is no clear template of progression. They rate the progress of the disease by an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). -0- being no disability all the way to 9 which is bed ridden and totally dependent to 10 death. Sorry to sound morbid but this is the reality of the situation and now you can see why it strikes so much fear. After scouring the internet something interesting came up, HSCT and stem cell treatment for MS. An excerpt from  www.hsctstopsms.com “HSCT currently gaining a lot of attention in the main stream media for its huge success in giving people with MS new hope and the epic possibility of totally halting disease progression, more and more people are asking: what is hsct? HSCT stops MS!  HSCT or Hematopioetic Stem Cell Transplant, is the only existing scientifically proven treatment, currently available that completely halts disease progression of Multiple Sclerosis. It is not a new procedure as such, as it has been used to treat cancer since the 1960’s, but it is a relatively new treatment for MS. Perhaps ‘new’ is the wrong word – The first HSCT performed specifically for an autoimmune disease (uveitis) was performed in 1985 by Prof. Shimon Slavin in Israel. The patient remains cured today. The first HSCT performed specifically for MS was at George Papanicolaou General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece in 1995. However, there were many observational case studies before then focusing on the success of HSCT for MS patients that were transplanted for cancer who simultaneously had their MS halted, as an unanticipated side effect of the treatment. All of the early studies that followed, also clearly established the now (well understood) probability that transplantation earlier in the disease life cycle is more beneficial than transplanting later in the disease evolution, when there is a greater degree of irreversible disability. Because the procedure involves the use of chemotherapy the treatment is not the most comfortable and is unfortunately quite expensive. What cannot be denied however is that to date HSCT is the only scientifically proven treatment that STOPS underlying disease progression in all types of MS and restores normal immune self-tolerance and produces lasting curative symptomatic improvement for most MS patients. To date over 2,000 patients have been treated worldwide, and the number continues to rise daily. While this treatment is standard procedure for treating cancer patients (thousands of patients are treated annually), it is not standard treatment for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis. There are a very small number of facilities Worldwide currently performing this procedure for MS. The hope is that more will open in the early future as the demand increasingly continues to outweigh the supply, and that the cost of being treated will reduce accordingly, as the protocol efficiency is optimized. Many who have already had HSCT say that one of the best parts of being treated is that halting the underlying disease progression of MS gives them back a future. George Goss, who had HSCT in 2009, an inspirational pioneer in promoting HSCT after he underwent the procedure in Heidelberg five years ago, describes this as “pure gold”.  (Please see his blog:   http://themscure.blogspot.co.uk/  and check out his HSCT forum on Facebook: Hematopioetic Stem Cell Transplant – MS & Autoimmune Diseases, where he has provided invaluable information and support for those seeking HSCT). Living with MS is both frightening and uncertain. Little is known about what sparks rapid disease progression with no warning. One can go 10 years with little or no symptoms and then suddenly find oneself in a wheelchair in the space of a few months. It has been described as a “Tiger that cannot be tamed”. HSCT removes this “Sword of Damocles” hanging over one’s heads and gives one the gift of hope and the luxury of planning a future with loved ones. Unless you live with MS you can have no concept of how magic this prospect can be!”The Hope is in Mexico:We guarantee everyone is saying “MEXICO?” Yes Mexico, from the research we’ve found Clinica Ruiz located in Mexico, our light at the end of this dark tunnel. If you have the chance, please look up  www.hsctmexico.com. We never had a Facebook page until now. Signing up for one has expanded our knowledge about HSCT and Mexico and is giving us hope. We’re hoping to go sooner than later, as time is not on our side and in doing so, increasing our chances of success. The percentage of success for treatment is higher the sooner you treat the disease, the percentage of success rate drops the longer you wait and the farther along the disease progresses. Once the disease progresses and the damage occurs, there is no reversal. It is not going to be easy. This is 28-days of intense treatment with tests, extraction of stem cells, chemo, re-introducing stem cells, monitoring, then heading back home for recovery anywhere from 6-12 months to prevent illness and infection. We are looking at expenses in the range of $75,000.00. Expenses include; the treatment, accommodations, flights, food and so on. This is all out of pocket as insurance will not cover this treatment. It is very hard to understand why HSCT is not available in the United States as a first option of treatment, but instead of complaining about it we are dealing with our situation and doing something about it which points us to Mexico. For those of you who know Aya, she never complains and she will never tell you if she’s hurting. At her worst, she will still smile, put others first and give 100% of herself. Today we are asking you to please put Aya first and help us help her fight this battle. We are humbly asking you for your support on behalf of Aya as any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for caring enough to take the time to read this",105,226,12,107,5 months,19 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Please join me, Leah's softball family, and my entire Long Hill Township NJ community in rooting on Leah as she battles to recover/rehab from a spinal stroke. In early March 2018, Leah became inexplicably paralyzed from the neck down and has been hospitalized on a ventilator.   After a lot of testing, they have decided they believe Leah may be one of the rare few pediatric patients who has suffered a spinal stroke.  Leah continues to improve everyday and she is fighting harder then she ever has before to regain movement in her limbs and breathe on her own.

Joe Mihalik, a longtime friend and business colleague of mine, took a fall while in the woods behind his home. The fall turned out to be catastrophic. He ended up not being discovered for over seven hours. He was barely conscious and unable to move in freezing temperatures, with his cell phone just feet away from him. Finally, after an exhaustive search by police and police dogs, they were able to locate him. He was stabilized and airlifted to the Morristown Memorial Hospital Trauma Center in Morristown, NJ.At the hospital, he spent 6 weeks in the ICU. He fractured four vertebrae in his neck, crushing the #2 vertebrae, and five vertebrae in his back causing a bruised spine. He also broke his coccyx (or tailbone), had three broken ribs, and suffered a lacerated lung. On top of that, he suffered two serious strokes. He was told that he would have paralysis in all four limbs, he would need a feeding tube because he couldn’t swallow without choking, and he was considered legally blind. It was a devastating prognosis.   Finally, on January 19, 2018 he was moved to Kessler Institute in West Orange, NJ. The therapists there are wonderful and he is very motivated to reclaim his life. He is making progress, but he can’t walk or feed himself and he gets very frustrated, as you can imagine.  He has a long road ahead of him with months of therapy, and he doesn’t know what the future holds. Unfortunately, while he is in rehab, the medical bills are piling up and he and his wife are  overwhelmed. He now has to sit back and watch everything they have worked for in life go down the drain. He is trying his best to stay focused on rehab, but it is difficult with all the financial worries. Joe is an avid outdoorsman and he has worked for Mark Patrick Seminars as a Hypnotherapist for twenty years. He and his wife, Heather, have traveled all over the country helping people to quit smoking and with weight-loss, thereby changing thousands and thousands of lives. Even after twenty years, he is passionate about his work because he lost his dad to heart disease, and he’s lost other family members to lung cancer and diabetes. Joe is a fighter, and he is already talking about getting back to helping others.  HOW THE MONEY WILL BE USED:Funds raised in this campaign will go directly to provide financial aid towards the many months of rehabilitation, transportation services to therapy, and special therapies that Joe will need.   Their insurance will not cover all of their expenses, and it can only cover a certain percentage of them. So we are asking for you to donate gracefully because this will help provide financial support towards Joe’s long recovery.  A LITTLE ABOUT ME:My name Pat Giorgio, and I have known Joe for over 33 years.

Recently diagnosed with breast cancer, April will undergo a double mastectomy and several months of aggressive cancer treatments.April is meeting all of this head-on, navigating the multiple appointments and multi- level decision-making, planning for all that is required of her logistically and physically over the next several months. And while no one can take on this part for her, we can help with the massive financial burden associated with it.Like many single parents who are small business owners, April is unable to simply stop working and continue to support her two boys Griffin and Sullivan. Yet, according to her medical team, the physical exertion required by her work as a wedding photographer may be impossible for several months following surgery and during the exhausting chemotherapy treatments. This has resulted in thousands of dollars of client refund costs and cancelled weddings.Further, bookings for summer and fall 2018 weddings are all happening now. Without a clear vision of her recovery track, April can’t, in good conscience, commit to new weddings. Therefore, she loses about half of this year’s income, and won’t be able to book any weddings until early 2019.Finally, while April does have insurance, she will be required to lay out $7400 to meet her deductible before insurance kicks in to pay for the massive cost of cancer treatment.We want April to put every ounce of energy into healing. We want her to not even consider the thought of going into credit card debt to pay for medical bills and other expenses. We know the village. We believe in its goodness. We know that April has been a part of it, carrying weight for others to ease their massive burdens. We want this care for April, in spite of her reluctance to ask for it.We are setting a fund-raising goal of $18,000, to cover that monstrous $7400 deductible, refunds, and a portion of lost living expenses, so that April can make healing her fulltime job this year.

It’s just who she is. Always caring, always willing to drop what she is doing to help, and always there to hug and pray with you.For more than the past few years, Courtney has been silently enduring so much medically. As most of us know, in 2015 Courtney had brain surgery to remove a cyst in her brain that was causing so many side effects for her. While the surgery to remove the cyst was a success, it was not without lingering complications. What we thought were just temporary symptoms from her surgery turned out to be TWO more cysts that had returned to the exact same spot she had her first removal. Her Dr. who specializes in this type of surgery and cysts had NEVER seen this happen before. Throughout it all, Courtney and Keith remained positive and steadfast in their walk with God knowing that he is her ultimate healer. In January 2017 Courtney had to go back into a second brain surgery to remove the two new cysts. The removal was a success and Courtney took her allotted 6 weeks off of work to heal and recover. All though she was still experiencing symptoms, Courtney returned to her job. The day she returned to work, she was informed she no longer had a position with the company. Courtney took this in stride and set out to find a new job. She sent in over 100 applications with no success. She is still currently unemployed and without health insurance. As of the past few months, Courtney’s symptoms since her second surgery have been progressively getting worse. One of her recent visits and scans has shown that the pressure in her brain from her spinal fluid is just too high. Her medical team has tried to treat this with multiple medications which Courtney’s body won’t tolerate. With this pressure comes intense headaches, vertigo, insomnia, loss of appetite, confusion, blurry vision, confused speech, and fatigue. It is clear to her medical team that she is in need of another surgery to place a shunt in her brain to relieve the fluid and pressure build up. This needs to be done now. There is no other option at this point. Since Courtney has lost her job, and Keith had recently started new employment, there is no health insurance at this time. They are above the income threshold to qualify for Medicaid which means this will be all out of pocket. After the hospital bringing the cost down over 50%, Courtney and Keith are looking at a $60,000.00 dollar price tag to get her through this. This money MUST be paid in full for her May 31st surgery by the 30th. We have to have all funds in by the 24th of this month to process and be able to pay the hospital. There you have it. This is the Goliath that they are facing in this moment. But we as believers know they do not face this alone. This is not a surprise to God, and it is in Him whom all our provision comes.I am asking all of our friends and family to take a moment and stop to pray. Pray first and foremost that God perform a complete healing and Courtney doesn’t need this surgery! However, if he chooses to use this medical team to give her relief and healing, pray that he can use each one of us to meet this financial need. No amount is too little.Luke 6:38 “Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you”Proverbs 3:27 “Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.”Romans 12:13 “Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.”James 2:14-17 “What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace; keep warm and well fed’, but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead”",168,815,4,163,3 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

For those of you who know me well, you'd know that the last thing I want to do is ask other's for help. I pride myself in being independent and self-reliant, but my mother getting sick happened all too fast and all too big for me to handle. The only thing I can do for my mom at this point in time is ask for help. (1 week before the incident)My mother, Myung Hee (Elizabeth) Park, is a parent who lives for her kids. She ran a dry cleaners by herself for 12 years, so that she could provide for my brother and me. She would hold in her urine many times because she feared to miss a customer and lose the extra dollar, the extra dollar that would go towards my brother's and my education.  She was the first one to teach me and my brother about unconditional love. My mother is the one person in the world that I love more than myself and she could've been gone in a matter of hours.  On 2/22/18, we took my mother into the ER where she was diagnosed with sepsis, which further developed into septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Despite giving her antibiotics, her white blood cell and procalcitonin levels kept increasing to levels that were the highest some doctors and nurses have seen in their career. Both her kidneys were failing and the liver was starting to fail as well. We were unsure that she was going to make it as septic shock has a very high mortality rate. In fact, multiple doctors have told me that it truly is a miracle she is alive. Due to the septic shock, my mother's blood pressure dropped drastically with a very irregular heart rate so we started her on multiple blood pressure medications to keep her blood pressure up. Unfortunately, her extremities have necrotized due to the minimal circulation from the blood pressure medications and her fingers and toes have resulted in gangrene (dead tissue). Currently, we are unsure how much of her hands and feet are going to to make it. We are waiting for the body to demarcate on its own and then, she will require amputations and prosthetics of both hands and feet in the future once she is stronger. There was substantial atrophy of her muscles from being strictly bedridden for weeks. My mother, once a healthy and independent woman, can no longer lift her arms to eat or sit up in a chair, let alone walk. She has a long and intense recovery with physical therapy, speech therapy (from being intubated multiple times and for long period of time), and occupational therapy.My mother almost died. No, that would be an understatement. Just looking at her blood results, symptoms, and the severity of her sepsis, she should have died. However, my mom is the strongest woman I know and her strength is what kept her alive. Recently, she told me, ""It's okay if I don't have hands or feet. I'm alive. I'm grateful and happy that I will be able to see you and your brother grow."" My mom's passion is cooking. She's the best cook, trust me. For my friends who've tried her food, you'll agree. So when she said that to me, I cried. A lot. For the 432489th time. By some miracle and everyone's thoughts and prayers, my mom is alive. She has a long road to recovery ahead of her and my family needs a miracle to make sure she gets there. The surgery, prosthetics, rehab centers, therapy appointments, medications, etc. will probably add up to more than 25,000, but please help my family start her recovery period. I'm still in disbelief that I find myself in a position to write this, but here I am. My mother is the sweetest, brightest, warmest and strongest woman I know and deserved none of this. She has done everything for my brother and me, so please help me do something for my mom. Thank you.",514,537,4,508,5 months,4 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

The immunotherapy trial worked with my immune system to fight the cancer, but I have suffered fatigue, and continued growth of the cancerous skin nodules on my left side. Also, my breathing has continued to deteriorate to the point that I now am forced to use a portable oxygen machine. The doctors have been concerned about the continued skin involvement and breathing troubles so a biopsy was performed on some skin nodules to see if my immune system had begun attacking the cancer cells. Unfortunately, my immune cells were not present in the nodules and this indicates that the treatment is not yet working.  So....my doctors decided to move on to another treatment. I started chemotherapy last Thursday. This chemotherapy is strong and works to attack the cancer. I will see more side effects from this treatment than the immunotherapy. It is likely I will suffer from fatigue, nausea, low blood counts and I will lose my hair again (this time it’s curly hair ). The doctors need to combat the cancer now, in hopes that a promising clinical trial becomes available. I will likely have to avoid a lot of crowds and germs but I will continue fighting like I have been for the past year and a half. I am so overwhelmed by the amazing support of my family, friends and community we are so thankful to know that we aren’t in this alone. After several months of telling Amy not to put this page up, I’m glad she finally got me to cave. I have been able to share my story and reconnect with so many friends from all over.

To those who have the pleasure of knowing her, it came as a shock to say the least.  It seems unimaginable that this could happen to a vibrant, young woman who prides herself in her work as a personal trainer and lives a healthy lifestyle. It's  hard to think that this could happen to such a good person. Sarah is a loyal friend, caring daughter, supportive sister, devoted partner to her significant other, Jacquie and of course loving dog mom to her fur baby, Wendy; she means so much to the many people in her life. She is a truly beautiful human being with a kind heart and genuine soul.  Sarah's journey in her fight against cancer is just beginning. This journey will no doubt be a challenge, but certainly one Sarah will conquer with grace and dignity. Sarah's courage thus far has been worthy of admiration; she is a true inspiration. As her medical team at Dana-Farber continues to work tirelessly to determine the primary source of her cancer, the medical bills have already started to pile up. Given that the cancer has spread to many lymph nodes throughout her body, Sarah will need aggressive chemotherapy.  She has been out of work due to debilitating nerve pain and endless medical appointments. She will continue to be unable to work for the foreseeable future. As Sarah fights hard to heal her body, we want to remove some of her financial burden so that Sarah can focus on kicking cancer's ass.HOW YOU CAN HELP SARAH:And so we ask that you to consider supporting Sarah in anyway you can.

He was diagnosed with young onset/early stage Alzheimer's Disease at 62. He started showing symptoms 2-3 years prior, but we didn't know what was going on.Geno and I were married on June 26, 1982, 36 years ago. We have raised two sons, Ben and Owen. Our family was very thankfully formed through adoption. They both came to us through Open Adoption at birth.Geno was a Special Education teacher, firewood supplier, track coach and placer gold miner over the course of our adventuresome years together.Upon the onset of AD we were able to continue our lifestyle to a lesser degree with each passing year as he lost more and more cognitive abilities. Working was out almost immediately, but he was still able to camp, gold mine and run for a while. When all else was falling away he could still run.... So I  had him join a local running team, Sierra Gold. With a teammate at his side at every training session and in every race he was able to compete in local 5k races for 3 years! The past year even that skill began to disappear. He got lost 7 times over a period of 4 months. Fortunately for us some kind neighbor, or complete stranger would bring him home.This is a man who is in the Athletic Hall of Fame at California State University Chico and is still listed in the top 10 for both the 800 m and the mile!His time spent with caregivers increased until he was with them 5 days a week, at an out of pocket cost of over $1,500/month.On April 27, 2018, I placed him in Sierra Ridge Memory Care in Auburn, CA. It was the right timing for both of us. My health was beginning to suffer and I knew I had to trust that someone else could take over his care. Geno has adapted easily to his new living situation and is cared for with loving care ""In the Moment"". However, this loving care comes with a hefty price tag. Beginning August 1 my out of pocket cost will jump from an introductory fee of $3,000/month to $5,200/month because of his toileting issues (he pees in the hallways because he doesn't know where the bathrooms are AND he doesn't know how to tell anyone that he needs to go) besides needing help dressing and showering.MediCal does not kick in until someone requires skilled nursing, ie, is bedridden. Geno won't qualify for that for a long time, unless he falls and breaks a hip or gets pneumonia. Wonderful choices.So in a nutshell, within one year I will have no more money, he will still need care, and I will probably have to sell our home for his continued care, leaving me destitute. I never in my wildest dreams ever expected to be in this kind of situation. But here it is. Geno and I need financial help.Thank you for your consideration.",123,277,11,139,2 months,17 hours ago,-1,2018-09-03

As of right now there are plans for Austin to have alternative forms of therapy to combat cancer growth. The purpose of this page is to help fund Austin's dreams to travel the world. We have been so fortunate for him to have  great health insurance and such an incredible family and support system but I would like to raise some money for him so he can travel to all the places he has always wanted to go including Thailand, Ireland, Myanmar, Spain and more.I just want more than anything for him to find some happiness through the tough year ahead of him. Love, Lena",204,421,19,204,1 month,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

His story begins back on December 3, 2017 when he was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic small cell lung cancer that spread to his liver and bones. He immediately began chemotherapy and completed 18 rounds. Shortly after, he completed 10 rounds of chest radiation. On April 10th 2018, Samir had three ischemic strokes and was hospitalized. Shortly after, on June 1st doctors informed him that the cancer had metastasized to his brain. He then completed 10 rounds of brain radiation in hopes of stopping the growth. July 12th 2018 after his CT scan follow-up, doctors informed him that the cancer had returned back on his right lung, spine and hips. This has been an eight month long downhill battle for Samir and his family. I would like to ask our community and anyone wanting to help to please donate however much is in their ability, as well as send prayers to him and his family to fight through this battle.

On Tuesday, 8/7/18, he was lethargic and very sleepy- only staying awake for 1-2 minutes at a time. He was taken to his pediatricians office where he was referred to the ER at UPMC. He was immediately admitted and doctors began testing. Keli and Jason’s worst nightmare was when a cat scan confirmed he had a huge mass on his brain. On Wednesday 8/8/18, Gage underwent brain surgery in hopes to remove the tumor.  8 hours and 3 blood transfusions later, the nightmare became a reality. Gage has brain cancer, and they were not able to remove the entire mass as it was so deep in his brain and removing from his brain stem was too dangerous.

Cuando tenía 6 meses me diagnosticaron Hipoplasia del Cuerpo Calloso lo que hace que los hemisferios de mi cerebro no se comuniquen bien y, entre otras cosas, mi desarrollo psicomotor se ha visto bastante afectado por lo que todavía no digo palabras, no camino, no tengo mucho equilibrio, no mastico la comida y me es difícil sostener las cosas.Nací en México en donde comencé a hacer terapia desde los 6 meses. Cuando tenía 1 año y 3 meses nos mudamos a Estados Unidos, ya que mis médicos le recomendaron a mis papás que allí tendríamos más oportunidades, mejores terapias y más tecnología que me ayudarían a combatir mis fallas psicomotoras. Durante mi tiempo en Estados Unidos he tenido la fortuna de poder hacer mis terapias ocupacional, física y de lenguaje. He mejorado, pero en el trayecto le dijeron a mis padres que también tengo parálisis cerebral y mi espalda, pies, manos, ojos y oídos se han visto afectados también. Por eso he tenido que visitar a especialistas de la espalda, de los pies, de la vista y de la audición.Mi diagnóstico es complicado y por eso necesito hacerme varios estudios médicos para poder saber realmente qué sucede dentro de mi cerebro, cómo afecta mi cuerpo y entender cuáles son las mejores herramientas para ser tratada. Esos estudios incluyen resonancia magnética para ver como ha evolucionado mi cerebro desde la primera vez que diagnosticaron la malformación del cuerpo calloso, examen de la vista para saber como mi cerebro interpreta las imágenes, exámenes auditivos para saber cuanto y como escucho, exámenes de la columna vertebral ya que tengo una pequeña desviación, examen genético para determinar la causa de lo que me pasó. También necesito férulas y equipos que me den soporte para aprender a caminar, a sostener las cosas, dispositivos para ayudarme a comunicar, terapias y ejercicios en agua.Actualmente no cuento con seguro médico y mis padres tampoco cuentan con el dinero para pagar por todo esto que suma aproximadamente $21,000 USD. Mi mamá debe estar conmigo 100% de su tiempo acompañándome en terapias y mi papá trabaja mucho para cubrir los gastos. Ellos no quisieran perder la oportunidad de darme todo lo que puedan para que yo mejore y más ahora que estoy pequeña y mi cerebro, con la ayuda necesaria, puede aprender a compensar sus fallas y yo, dentro de mis capacidades, ser una niña independiente. Si no puedes ayudarme con un aporte económico no importa, igual te agradezco haberte tomado el tiempo de leer mi historia y lo que te pido es que la compartas porque también así me ayudas.De corazón muchísimas gracias!!!_______________________________________________________Hi, my name is Sofia and I´m 3 years and a half old. When I was 6 months the doctors diagnosed me with Hypoplasia Corpus Callosumwhich makes it difficult for my two sides of the brain to communicate well and, among other things, my psychomotor skills have been quite affected and because of that I cannot say word, I cannot walk, I do not have much of a balance, I cannot chew my meals and it is hard for me to grasp things.I was born in Mexico, where, when I was 6 months old, I began my therapy. We moved to the USA when I was 1 year and 3 months old because my doctors in Mexico advised my mom and daddy that here I would have more opportunities, better therapies and technologies to help me fight my psychomotor delay. Since I arrived to USA I have had the fortune to do more language, physical and occupational therapies. I have improved, but along the way my parents were informed that I also suffer from cerebral palsy and my back, feet, hands, eyes and ears have also been affected. Because of this, I have to visit back, feet, eyes and ears specialists.My diagnostic is quite complicated and I need to have several medical examinations to try to understand what is really happening inside my brain, how it affects my body and to try to determine which are the best tools for my treatment.These medical examinations include magnetic resonance scan (MRI scan) to see how my brain has responded from the first time the doctors diagnosed the malformation of my corpus callosum, eye exams to see how my brain interprets images, hearing exams to know how much and how I hear, cerebral and spine exams because I my back has a slight curvature, as well as a genetic exam to determine the cause of what happened to me. I also need splints and diverse devices that will support me while I learn to walk, grab objects with my hands, devices to help me communicate and more therapies and exercises in the therapy pool.At the moment I do not have a medical insurance and my parents do not have sufficient money to pay for what is mentioned before, which costs $21,000.00 approximately. My Mom must spend her time accompanying me to my therapies and my Dad works very hard to cover the costs. They want to give me all they can so I can get better, knowing that since I am just a kid my brain - with the appropriate help - can learn to compensate its flaws and I, within reason, may be a normal girl and lead a normal life.If you cannot help me with monetary funds, I would like to thank you for taking your time to read my story and I will kindly ask you for a very big favor: please help me by sharing my plea.I thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!",309,1.0k,5,305,5 months,2 months ago,4 months,2018-09-03
Medical,72,"A 2nd Chance At Life ""Stem Cells""",https://www.gofundme.com/76npy-a-2nd-chance-at-life,"JAMAICA, NY","June 9, 2018","$45,000","$28,315","January 2, 2015 is a day I will never forget. One day can change your life. One day can change everything. It did for me. While heading to the city to pursue my dream of being a singer, I was shot by someone I had never met or even shared a word with. And for that, I lost the use of my body from a bullet that wasn’t meant for me. I am paralyzed and can’t move my legs or arms.Ever since this day, I’ve been fighting for the return and use of my body, something given to me from birth but taken from me for no reason. I’ve tried to work out, do physical therapy, but nothing is helping me recover. I’ve tried everything, and despite the lack of a drastic change, I’ve continued to fight.For the past three years I’ve prayed every day for God to not only heal me and help me but to protect my family from being put in the same predicament. I’ve cried; I’ve been angry and depressed. But one thing I have yet to do is give up. I beleive that God only gives us tests that we can succeed in. Maybe this is mine.My faith in God and the determination of my mother to find the right person to help me led us to do a lot of research. We came across a place in Panama that is doing amazing work with stem cells. The Stem Cell Institute of Panama City uses a groundbreaking method for paralysis. Now, there’s no guarantee that this treatment will fully heal me, but I’ve tried everything else, and this is my last option. I really feel deep down in my heart that this will help.Hope is so close at hand. However, my mother spent a lot to care for me and to try to get me as close to any recovery as I could. You may wonder why I am not trying stem cells in America; each one I went to turned me down due to the fact that my injury was from a bullet. It’s sad because I was just trying to reach people with my music and be a good son to my mom and support her. I live a prayer-filled life, and was studying to be a corrections officer so I can have a good salary while I work on my music. And all I needed was someone to give me a chance because I know if I would of receive stem cells I would be walking by now.That’s why I’m asking you--people I’ve never met but who may just be willing to help me fight and recover--to please donate what you can. Please, from the kindness of your hearts, help me, even if it’s just a few dollars. Every lit bit goes a long way. I will be praying for all of you and will be eternally grateful. I know it’s a lot to ask for, but I am very grateful for each and every one of you. If you read my story and were moved to donate, allow me to say thank you now. I appreciate your kindness from the bottom of my heart. If you were only able to offer up a prayer for me today, thank you, and I will be praying for you, too. May God bless you.

Medical,72,CANCER TREATMENT for TRAVIS,https://www.gofundme.com/cancer-treatment-for-travis,"ARLINGTON, WA","June 18, 2018","$40,000","$28,300","Friends & Family,This past May marked three years in Travis’s battle with cancer. For the last 15 months, Travis has been on constant chemotherapy to treat his stage 4 colon cancer. That includes several port chemo’s via infusion every-other week, one phase 2 clinical trial and one phase 3 clinical trial. Non-stop therapy with the exception of a week when he had a blood clot in his lung and a week when we got married.As all of you know, Travis is a FIGHTER. He is the strongest person I have ever known. I’ve seen first hand what this chemo can do to a person. It is not pretty. It can be a daily struggle. He goes through so much on these treatments. He amazes me at how he can still beam that beautiful smile of his even on his worst days. Travis works so incredibly hard. He does his chemo treatments Friday through Sunday so that he is ready to work at UPS Tuesday through Friday the following week.We are on an uphill battle. With his tumor marker on the rise since late last year, he has challenged his doctors on finding a chemotherapy that will work for his disease. This has been difficult. We were told that Travis has DEPLETED the available medicines to treat him with. He is on the list for new clinical trials. We declined a phase 1 trial that was offered to him a few weeks ago, as it would be the first time tested on HUMANS and he would spend 8 consecutive days in Seattle getting blood draws every 15 minutes for 12 hours a day. Quality of life is very important to Travis and this was not an option.I have a dear, close friend that reached out to me demanding I watch a documentary on Amazon Prime called, ‘Cancer Can be Killed’. This is where Travis’s story of becoming cancer free will begin. I know it! Several treatments are offered in Europe, Germany in our case, that the FDA has not made available here in the U.S.One of the treatments is Hyperthermia. Simply put, cancer doesn’t like heat. Once cancer cells are heated above approximately 105 degrees Fahrenheit their metabolism starts to break down. This halts further growth and causes the cells to die. That means tumor shrinkage and slower progression of disease.While they perform hyperthermia treatment every other day, you are on therapies like; Laetrile, Thymus Therapy, herbal supplements, ozone therapy (oxygenate your blood), Autologous Stem Cell Therapy, Tri-functional antibodies, Chelation, Vitamin C, Calcium EDTA, Myers’ Cocktail, Dioxychlor, Glutathione, liver support and many more IV infusions. All while eating a complete alkaline diet with limited red meat and no refined sugars.With your immune system at its best, they then do Dendritic Cell Therapy. The laboratory will work on Travis’s blood for 8 days. They will concentrate his body’s Dendritic cells on correctly identifying his body’s cancer as a threat, then they will reintroduce those cells into his system, the ‘trained’ cells can boost his body’s capacity to work AGAINST the cancer. The idea is to have Travis’s specific cancer battled by HIS OWN enhanced or boosted self immunity---a tailored cancer treatment vaccine! You guys, this MAKES sense! No chemotherapy- that kills his good cells and lowers his immune system to a terrifying low, with side effects that are completely awful.If you have time, please read up on this! Some lucky individuals are getting T-cell immunotherapy in clinical trials with diseases like lymphoma here in the states (literally on the floor above where Travis gets his chemotherapy at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance). It is not being tried on colorectal cancer at this time, and Travis, unfortunately does not have the time to wait until it is.Travis’s friends & family CARRIED him through his first year with this disease. He could not have done it without your help. That has never left his heart & mind. It is difficult for him to ask for help, but we are at the point.Travis’s doctor said we are out of options other than clinical trial chemotherapy. In time, his cancer will spread throughout his body and to his major organs. We are desperate for this treatment and are hoping to be able to go in August or September as time is of the essence. My mom is selling her 1978 Z28 Camaro and Patty, Travis’s mom is selling her motor-home to help out.I have created this go fund me for those who can and want to help get Travis to Germany for this advanced, once in a lifetime treatment. I will blog his journey and treatments and will become an advocate for ANYONE who needs help if they consider this treatment for themselves or a loved one.Here is the breakdown of cost at Infusio in Frankfurt, Germany:Flights: $1957Integrative Dendritic Cell Therapy Program: $34,70530 day stay @ Infusio Germany: $4,465Germany Liason Fees: $3,228Stem Cell Transportation: $1,103Airport Transfer: $220Admin Fee: $1311Total: $46,989Please continue to keep Travis in your thoughts and prayers.Thank you,Danielle",145,1.1k,43,142,2 months,17 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Isabella was planning on finishing her PhD in Neuroscience and Psychological Brain Science at the University of Arizona. We have witnessed an outpouring of love and prayer from those familiar to us and those of total strangers. God is great and has shown his guiding love in helping Isabella survive this initial setback. She remains in critical condition, a result of a brain injury and extensive head trauma. She is just beginning the long road of recovery. We are optimistic and see daily signs of her advancement. Daily, we pray that her progress will continue. Isabella had planned to use her advanced education to help those caught in the deadly grip of drug and alcohol addiction. She was looking forward to concentrating on the next phase of her PhD program in a clinical environment to do just that. We are asking support for ongoing living, legal, and healthcare expenses that Isabella and her partner Conner Lehane are facing due to these unforeseen and catastrophic events. Her Mother -- Dawn Lushin, and Father -- Gregg Manfredi, are setting up short term housing here in Tucson to support her recovery and be with her for ongoing legal and healthcare management.Social Media is a blessing and has shown great promise in bringing us together as Human Beings. We ask for your kindness and monetary support to fund Isabella and Connor during these difficult times. Any donation will be appreciated along with your continued prayers, thoughts, and good wishes. The outpouring of love we have witnessed has increased our sometimes fragile faith in God and drives our immediate hope for a speedy recovery for our Daughter, Granddaughter, Sister, Niece, Friend, Partner and Child of God.Many thanks in advance and God’s Blessings to you and your family.",256,1.8k,5,263,1 month,23 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,72,Help Tim S.  Beat Prostate Cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/tim-schwentor039s-prostate-party,"MAKAWAO, HI","May 26, 2018","$106,500","$43,655","TIM’S PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSISHi there, I'm Jake and I've been friends with Tim and the ""Schwentor Clan"" for three years. They were the first family I became friends with when I moved to Maui. Tim has never asked me for anything ever... so when he called me and asked for my help with a GoFundMe, I knew I had to help. In May, 2018, after experiencing debilitating migraines and inability to urinate, and after several tests at Maui Medical Group in Kahului, Hawaii and a trip to the emergency room, Tim was diagnosed with Stage IV Metastatic Prostate Cancer. [Prostatic Adenocarcinoma & Invasive Carcinoma].As many of you know, he’s the father of four kids, Asher, 7, Oli, 10, Zach, 13 and Julia, 17, and Circe’s husband of 22 years. He’s also an active member of the Baha’i Faith and community volunteer.Tim is the sole provider financially and works construction on Maui. Circe is the sole educator to the four homeschooled children.Just before the diagnosis, Tim and his family were planning to go on a 48 state tour of the United States and travel teach between 2017 and 2019, for the bicentenary of The Bab and Baha'u'llah (the Twin Manifestations of The Baha’i Faith.)The firesides are an interactive 7-part series designed for friends of friends, communities and informal gatherings to investigate who we really are, the nature of being human and about Oneness of God, Religion and Humanity.The plan is to deal with the prostate cancer head on, and get out on the road just as soon as Tim is healthy.JULIA, 17, TIM’S DAUGHTER, WANTED TO SHARE WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO HER.My dad has loved me unconditionally. This is the first time in my life I’ve realized my dad isn’t invincible. For example, we can’t wrestle anymore as he’s grown weaker and barely has energy. Physical activity with dad is my main way of showing how much I love him, and so it feels like I can’t show him how much I love him anymore. The boys and I have had to adapt to show love to him in different ways. We play board games now. But it’s not the same. If he doesn’t get the treatment he needs, then he could die. It would leave me and my family struggling to live without him. We aren’t rich and my dad works hard to give us everything he can as a the sole financial provider in the household. If he doesn’t get the treatment, and if he dies, I would be devastated. I’m worried that my mom would have to do everything to support the family. I’m the oldest and that comes with the understanding that if something happens, I’m the one who is going to be strong and have to carry the family through. Without the treatment, I wouldn’t be able to be daddy’s little girl. My brothers, age 7, 10, 13, are like a pack. Dad is the leader of the pack. The boys are the heart. Without him, I imagine my brothers would feel lost. My dad gives my brothers boundaries, strong nurturing love, encourages them with their ideas and experiments. Anyone that’s met my dad knows how much he loves the boys. Without my dad, I think they would be great human beings, but I fear that the two youngest, especially Asher, 7, would grow up to only barely recollect him. I want more time with him. I want my brothers to have more time with him. If you don’t know my dad, but are considering donating, he’s why you should consider: He is loving and caring and never asks for anything of anybody ever. He selflessly gives everything he can. He teaches me and so many others about virtues and how to think about and live life. He’s funny and makes me laugh, pushes me and challenges me and everyone he comes into contact with to be the best self. He loves and gives and if you could give, we would be very grateful. NEEDED FUNDSBecause doctors have only offered palliative care, such as hormone therapy (chemical castration), and not a cure, Circe and Tim and the family have decided that alternative therapy at the CHIPSA HOSPITAL, one that has many examples of curing stage IV cancers, is the best route.Because of the nature of the cancer, and that it has spread, Tim and Circe have decided to do a rigorous 3-week program at CHIPSA headquarters, a hospital for advanced Gerson and immunotherapy work.According to the Chipsa website, “stage IV cancer is very complicated disease and there aren’t any easy answers. What we can assure you is we have the most experience with natural therapies with cutting edge immunotherapies and modern therapies than anyone else in North America.”Cost for two plane tickets from Maui to San Diego, and childcare: $1,500Cost for three weeks of therapy (plus one caregiver stay) $33,000.Because Tim is primary breadwinner, and does heavy construction, the family needs $3000 per month of living expenses for 24 months.24 months is the general time for “healing and rebuilding the body, including restoring the liver and essential organs to full function”  according to The Gerson Institute.Total needed for treatment: $34,500Total needed for 24 months of healing and on-going medications: $72,000$106,500. Currently.** Note, initial funds will be used to get Tim into treatment ASAP. Any remaining money will go towards helping living expenses. 100% of proceeds up to $33K will be used for Hospital CHIPSA and the rest will be used as described above. All funds will be transferred to Circe. TIMELINE FOR FUNDSCirce is primary educator of their four homeschooled children and therefore, we need to begin the process immediately and urgently.WHAT HAPPENS AFTER HEALING?Any remaining unused funds that are raised will be donated to other Gerson patients once Tim returns to work.We thank you for your consideration of becoming involved and supporting Tim’s recovery, the Schwentor family, and their teaching efforts.",121,536,3,125,3 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Sadly, actual diagnosis remained unknown until January 2018, when he was found to have a thoracic tumor diagnosed as diffuse B cell non Hodgkins lymphoma (a form of blood cancer affecting lymphocytes). This was devastating to him and the family. He suffered several complications including multiple pleural & pericardial effusions, septisaemia, low blood counts, deep vein thrombosis, hemiparesis and much more. His parents tried to provide the best available treatment for him at great financial, emotional and physical price. The location of the disease created complications necessitating prolonged hospital stay between January and June with bills and chemotherapy costing millions of naira. His family stuck by Nathaniel in this long and tasking journey, mopping up all family resources because they refuse to give up on their son. Hence this fundraising appeal to save him. Currently, he is hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit of Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. He arrived on 28th June after the journey requiring oxygen and ambulance services to the hospital on arrival. He is currently receiving treatment for complications and the tumor is now diagnosed to be an aggressive T-Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (TLBL). This warranted starting tests and treatment all over. The Emory team discovered he had clots in both lungs and his heart, fluid around his lungs and heart and a damaged left lung. He has had pulmonary and cardiac surgical procedures, suffered respiratory failure requiring life support and recommencement of new and expensive treatment. These are all associated with a growing hospital bill, currently at over $600,000 and counting as treatment continues. In spite of all, Nathaniel, in his will to live, continues fighting for his life. He looks forward to getting well and completing his studies, like youths his age. Available and hopeful treatment options for Nathaniel currently include bone marrow transplant, costing hundreds of thousands of USD. This is currently beyond the reach of his family and they seek help to save their son's life by donating to his treatment here or via His mother's bank account:Account name: Tinuade Oyebode Account number: 3004909009Bank name: First Bank Nigeria.

Or maybe as Linda’s husband. Perhaps you've worked alongside him during his 30 years at Lockwood. Or you may not know him at all. Whatever the case, thank you for reading his (and our family’s) story…Randy Jones is known as a strong, hardworking and dependable man. Over the years you may have seen him at the stables feeding the horses, or in the barn working on cars, and a lot of times building something new on the farm. Building new things and tinkering are his most enjoyable hobbies. Those who know him best know that these are some of his favorite ways to spend time and that without his work, Randy wouldn’t know what to do with himself.  Throughout our lives, he has used this inherent work ethic and love for creating to build the best livable space for his family and giving us a cherished place to grow up and thrive. The beautiful homes, yards, swing sets, and patios are all things he built because he wanted his family to have them. All of these things had to be perfect in his eyes, even when we didn’t care if they were perfect or not. His undeniable desire to create these things now serve as the backdrop to so many beautiful memories. But as of late doing the work that he loves so much has been nothing short of daunting.He has always been a man of great action but very few words. Being the private person that he is, you may not have been aware that he is battling a disease that leaves him exhausted just from getting out of bed in the morning. Seven years ago, Randy was diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a rare, degenerative liver disease with no known cure. Recent months have been the toughest for him. Because of this disease, he has endured agonizing symptoms like excessive bleeding, complete loss of muscle tone, fever spouts, loss of appetite, and fluid build-up in his abdomen. There are days where he can’t reach down to tie his shoes because of the fluid build-up. He has to get his abdomen drained nearly every week now. On Wednesday, May 30th doctors drained 6.5 liters - roughly 14 lbs. He doesn’t have enough energy to do household chores. It’s almost too exhausting for him to drive to and from work. Both his body and his spirit have deteriorated. This disease, which targets the bile ducts then slowly causes the liver to fail, affects 1 in 10,000 people per year in the US. Doctors say the cause remains unclear. No one knows how or why this happened to him. With luck on his side, Randy will undergo transplant surgery at VCU in Richmond, VA in the coming months. The procedure is not without risks, but with Randy’s condition worsening each day, there is no other choice. If the months of recovery go as planned, the transplant will give him much needed strength and he will be able to regain his quality of life. Something that right now seems so distant.Sadly, coping with the disease, transplant surgery, and beginning the long road to recovery are only part of the worries weighing on him right now. So we are reaching out to ask for something that a man like Randy never could … Help. As many of you are aware, even with the blessing of a donor comes a nightmarish list of expenses: medical bills, lodging for on-site recovery, transportation to and from Richmond, farm maintenance, and lost income throughout it all.We want to see our dad doing what he loves again – but we need your help. Any donation, big or small, gets us closer to our goal and Randy closer to a calm recovery. Whether you donate because you know one of us, Linda, or Randy himself, we are forever grateful for your kindness.   In anxious wait of better days,Wesley, Jobi, Mandy, and Randall",141,461,8,137,3 months,22 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

This request is written from the hearts of so many who love, support and are praying for Emily King. Emily is a beautiful, intelligent 24-year-old young lady. Emily’s physical beauty is always striking, but it is her inner beauty that radiates more. She truly is the one to bring sunshine wherever she goes. Until approximately three weeks ago, Emily was a healthy, active Speech Pathology student, looking forward to graduate school and life with her boyfriend, Brad. Following a mammogram, she received the shocking news that she had a large, 8 cm tumor in her breast. It was not breast cancer but a rare, aggressive cancer that had settled in her breast – an Angiosarcoma. There is an estimated 200 cases a year in the world. Immediately, she was scheduled for surgery and the tumor was successfully removed. The next week, the week of August 20, 2018, Emily traveled to MD Anderson Cancer Center with her family as recommended by the physicians. They are currently at MD Anderson in Texas. Apparently, removing the tumor is just the very small tip of the iceberg and this is something that, once present, grows microscopic sized cancer cells that can travel through the blood stream to different parts of the body. The doctors determined chemo would be necessary and she began treatment Monday morning, August 27, 2018. The first round will last 4.5 months, and Emily will be required to stay in Houston the entire time. In total, everything is going to take about a year. The second and third treatments are more routine and can be given in her home town. Their lives have been turned upside down in a matter of just a few weeks. Emily will not be able to continue working and will be faced with financial difficulties. Emily does not have finances necessary to pay for this level of medical care and treatment. Please know that this petition is written and submitted by so many – Emily’s family, friends and even those who do not know them! Everyone realizes that this cannot be done alone, so please, please spread the word and contribute as much as you can. Help us help Emily so that she and her family do not have to worry about anything other than Emily getting well. In addition, prayers are much appreciated, and many are praying ceaselessly for a miracle. Please join them. Any assistance will be so appreciated.

Maryn is an amazing kid who loves sports, art, camping, movies with popcorn, and playing with her big sister.    Photo by: Keyana Tahmaseb    http://www.keyanatahmaseb.com/ The highlight video is from very special events with the Portland Thorns FC.  We are eternally grateful to the Thorns for these amazing events that allowed us to celebrate Maryn 7th birthday with friends and family!  It was also a celebration of the completion of the intense six weeks of travel to and from Doernbecher for 30 radiation treatments, and the completion of her daily chemo treatments.

Maryn’s family…Chrissy and Graham both work for school districts.  Chrissy is an Administrator, working with federal programs in Woodburn and Graham is on the Behavior Cadre working with high-need kids in classrooms throughout Salem. Cora, Maryn’s big sister, is an avid soccer player and will start middle school in the fall.How it began…Maryn, a normally high-spirited and lively 6 year-old, became sick and spent all day Thursday, March 15th, in a deep sleep.  The next day, Chrissy and Graham took her to the doctor, where the doctor quickly recommended Maryn go to the ER for a full work up to include a cat scan, chest x-ray and blood work.  The results showed a brain hemorrhage and the decision was made to send her via life flight to Doernbecher Children’s Hospital in Portland.  Upon arrival, things moved quickly, MRIs and CT scans were administered, and a massive tumor was detected in the left side of her brain.  The doctors performed emergency surgery (around 1am Saturday) to relieve the pressure in her brain, knowing a second brain surgery would be necessary within days.On Tuesday, March 20th, Maryn spent the day in brain surgery, where the surgical team resected about 98% of the 6 cm tennis ball sized tumor.  By the end of the week, she was released from the hospital to begin recovering and regaining her strength at home.On Thursday, March 29th, Maryn’s family received the pathology reports, and Maryn was diagnosed with Glioblastoma, Stage IV brain cancer.  This is a very aggressive form of brain cancer that creates tumors at a rapid rate, and is incredibly rare in children. While the surgeon was able to remove the visible tumor, likey some micro cells remain in her brain tissue.What followed was a course of treatment that included 6 weeks of radiation and 6 weeks of daily chemo (which she managed to complete 5 weeks before her platelets fell too low to continue). Maryn also receives occupational therapy and sees vision specialists at Casey Eye Institute.  The family is fortunate to have a world-class hospital in Doernbecher Children’s, just 45 miles away, with both Chrissy and Graham’s parents there to share in the drives to Portland for her treatments. Why are we asking for support today?There currently is no cure for glioblastoma, but there is research taking place around the world. The standard treatment typically keeps the cancer from coming back for about 15 months, but doctors have been clear that at that point this type of cancer always comes back and the options at that point are limited. There are many clinical trials providing hope, and the family has decided to participate in a clinical trial in New York City. The family will embark on a course of treatment that may span up to two years, requiring Maryn and family to travel between Salem, OR, and New York City every three weeks. The entire family will be in New York for up to four weeks to start the trial (starting July 29th), and then begin the three week travel cycle for Maryn’s one day of blood work and treatments, which also require her to be in NYC.It sounds like the clinical trial chemo has minimal side effects, so hopefully Maryn will feel good enough to play sports, go to school and play with her friends. It will be tough traveling that much, but the hope is the clinical trial is more effective than the standard treatment.The costs…Maryn’s family is fortunate to have a good health care plan that allows her top-notch care, but treatments outside of Oregon fall under out-of-network care.  During the clinical trial, the medications will be covered; however, the doctor visits and other hospital costs will fall under their out-of-network medical costs, and the travel will be the responsibility of the family as well.There will be many financial hurdles in the coming months and years, including travel and medical costs and lost wages resulting from taking time off for Family Medical Leave.  The first focus is on helping the family cover travel expenses and out-of-network medical costs.  If we exceed this goal, money will go toward helping cover lost wages Chrissy and Graham incur during the coming years.Goal -  $100,000 for travel costs and medical out-of-network deductibles for the next 24 months.  This will include the initial 3-4 week stay in NY, with 30+ additional trips over the next two years. Below are some of the key expenses the family faces.$26,000 – Out-of-network deductible - $13,000/year30+ trips to NY – $50,000 for plane tickets (30 plane tickets for Maryn, plus 50+ tickets for other family members)$12,000 for hotel rooms (The family will spend 80+ nights in NYC, staying at the Ronald McDonald when possible.  This will help cover 40+ nights of hotels if needed)$7,500 for travel between their home in Salem, OR, and the Portland airport & NYC airports and hotels/Ronald McDonald House, airport parking, and travel within NY for hospital visits (airport parking, Lyfts in NY)Additionally, Graham and Chrissy will face lost wages as their sick leave from work is depleted.  Maryn’s treatments fall mid-week, so each trip will result in about three days away from work.How you can help…We appreciate everyone following Maryn’s Caring Bridge page and supporting her journey.  Thank you for donating to Maryn’s medical journey and for sharing her story.  To help us get the word out, you can share my link on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, other social media or email.Some of you may have other options for support through frequent traveler programs – aka free airline tickets, hotel points – or gift cards for Lyft, etc.  I did reach out to several airlines, and there do not seem to be programs to donate miles to individuals without incurring standard transfer of mileage fees; however, the airlines recommended anyone with enough miles to purchase a ticket can purchase it for one of the family members without the transfer fees.  For any of these or other options, you can reach out to me (Stacy) personally.Here is a link to a wonderful story by the Portland Thorns FC:#MightyMaryn Thank you!Photo by: Keyana Tahmaseb  http://www.keyanatahmaseb.com/",196,950,3,205,1 month,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Unfortunately,  the following day his body began to have significant and mysterious neurological symptoms that quickly led to his inability to work. Devastatingly, his arms and legs became weak and easily pained after minimal use.  Next it became hard to swallow, muscles in his neck and shoulders became weak and muscle wasting started in his shoulders, arms, hands and feet.  A nightmare for someone who uses his body to perform precision therapy on the bodies of others.                                                                                                                                                       Michael helping mamas and their little ones                             Michael and Rainey had set aside an emergency fund, hoping they would never need it.  Luckily they had it, but that money and their other savings have been spent over the last 7 months on high deductibles, monthly bills, and seeing specialists not covered by insurance.  Michael maintained his office during this time with hopes that he would quickly return to work.  When it became clear that more time for healing was necessary, they made the tough decision to close down Michael’s office of 11 years in Fremont. Michael is seeking out traditional and holistic health care to try to get to the bottom of his medical issues. Michael’s income made up a large percentage of their combined income and they are currently unable to fully meet all of their monthly bills.  We are raising money to support Michael’s healing so that he can share his healing gifts again with the community.  These funds also support his wife Rainey (who is his main caregiver), with domestic help, health care sessions from local healers so she does not burn out, and the time needed to continue her 3 year training in somatic psychology while building this new aspect of her business. Currently they owe $7000 in medical bills; think astronomical deductibles for Sole Proprietors.  Michael continues to see both main stream and alternative practitioners on a weekly basis and Rainey is also receiving support which is costing an average of $1500 per month. Each month they require an additional $5000 to meet their living expenses. The goal is to raise enough to get them through the end of 2018 with the hope that things will be much better by then. The Go Fund Me goal is to raise $50,000",218,451,5,218,2 months,6 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Darryl is one of the nicest people that you will ever know.  Even in the midst of his health struggles over the years, he has seemed to persevere  and remain positive through it all.Darryl was diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis nearly 30 years ago and has struggled with his digestive system ever since. Over time he was able to gain weight and feel healthier. Fast forward to five years ago, he found out that he had colon cancer, having his large intestine (colon) removed. He has since been functioning with only his small intestine after reconstruction of his intestinal tract. He has been disabled and unable to work ever since. As of three weeks ago, Darryl was hospitalized once again and diagnosed with Crohn's disease with intestinal blockage, in which a new specialist informed him that he was misdiagnosed 30 years ago. The doctors had to perform surgery once again on his intestines to clear the blockage and because of an abscess, his wounds has to remain open for him to heal from inside out. He has to wear a colostomy bag and has lost so much weight, down to a lowly 103 pounds. This is very sad to see. He is praying that he does not have to wear the colostomy bag for the rest of his life. Darryl lives in DeSoto, Texas, but for the time being has to reside with his 80+ year old parents (Jewel & Dorothy) to help care for him in Malvern, Arkansas. He is an only child. Darryl is also a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., initiated Alpha Zeta Chapter, Spring 87. He has always considered his brothers and sisters in Greekdom to be the siblings he never had.Darryl does not have healthcare and the medical expenses and home care is definitely a hardship on him and his parents to maintain. He is so modest and took convincing him to allow us to start this campaign. So, this campaign is a plea to all of Darryl's friends, family and even good Samaritans to show generosity.  Please give what you can and forward to others and let Darryl know that there are people that really care about him.

My physical condition has taken a turn for the worse in the past month and I am faced with yet another pressing time frame.As many of you know by my social media oversharing and venting, I have been living with chronic nerve and back pain. This started as a result of a car accident in 2008 that left me with a whole new perspective on life and physical health. In August 2016 I was then sidelined by an emergency spine surgery that racked up to $20,000. I took pride in paying my last bill in the 2017 and began building back my savings account this year. After weeks of escalating pain and nerve damage, and a decade of chronic pain and pain management, I have lost my quality of life. My job as a wellness practitioner is compromised, my happiness both in the gym and throughout life has been hampered, and my love for golf has been repressed. Turns out the necessary emergency surgery in 2016 was ultimately just a bandaid and the true fix is a Lumbar Spinal fusion (yes, like Tiger Woods).Even though I am a NYS insured individual and an independent working woman in New York City, I face the challenge of a surgery that will compromise my already compromised profession. In 2016 I lost almost 3 months of income due to surgery and rehabilitation. This next surgery will not only place my income on hold once again but will cost $35,000 for the surgeon alone. This doesn’t include any post operative care, physical therapy or household costs such as rent, utilities, and groceries. I have finally found an AMAZING spine surgeon that has deemed me an ideal candidate due to my age and physical condition for spinal fusion. With an 80% projected success rate and a reduction of most of my pain symptoms, I am hopeful to end this once and for all. I am truly thankful for any donations, food contributions, visitations or prayers you have for the success of this surgery and appreciate the time you took to read through my predicament. Regardless of donations I will be eternally grateful for your thoughts, love or well wishes and love y’all forever.",57,112,0,57,4 months,4 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

I am at a loss for words to try and understand how a super fit, healthy, amazing mom, wife, daughter, sister and friend could now become the victim of this awful disease. It has been a tough few weeks of testing, scans, scopes, countless doctor appointments and surgery for a feeding tube. The good news is that she is in good hands at UCSF and in the care of a great oncology team. Unfortunately, the progression of the mass has intensified and we are praying that her treatment of intense radiation and chemo therapy will start without delay in the coming week. Treatment will be 5 days a week for 7 weeks. Luckily, UCSF has reasonably priced housing in SF where she can stay to avoid the back and forth driving.  Courtney is a stubborn strong willed woman that continues to fight through nausea, fatigue and extreme pain. But she cannot do this alone. It truly will take a village to support Courtney, Will and two boys, Price 12 months and Tyler 12 years. How can you help, you ask? Financial support!  For child care and UCSF housing not to mention the overwhelming amount of medical and prescription expenses. On behalf of Courtney and Will and the amazing community that they are blessed by, we greatly appreciate any and all support, positive thoughts and prayers. Big hug and lots of love,Simone",229,456,3,224,24 days,18 days ago,5 days,2018-09-03

After nineteen months of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, the family is now turning to treatments not covered by insurance. They have spent thousands of dollars along the way and have committed significant resources to this campaign, but they are at the end of their financial rope and need our help.Commitment, the Soul of LoveKenzie’s relationship with her now-husband Mikayel Balian has been an inspiring example of love and commitment. Shortly after they began dating, Kenzie was diagnosed with a rare form of sarcoma. Every time Mikayel had a chance to run, he stepped up and took more responsibility for Kenzie’s care and emotional support.In January of this year, we were honored to host their wedding at our home. It was a magical day and a much-needed break from the turmoil. Much more than this, it was a positive affirmation of their intent to fight this battle together and live life to the fullest.Rare CancerSarcomas are identified in about 1% of all cancer diagnoses – about 15,000 per year in the United States – and Kenzie’s particular form is 1% rare among sarcomas. Kenzie’s team at the City of Hope and the Huntsman Cancer Institute and most recently UCLA are among the best in the oncology community, but they have had relatively little data on which to base an effective treatment regimen.Since her initial diagnosis at the start of September 2016, Kenzie has undergone aggressive chemotherapy, radiation, complete removal of her gluteus maximus on the affected hip, and complex surgery to remove nodules in both lungs.Each treatment has well understood limits. Radiation obviously must not be overused during an individual’s lifetime. Surgically, one of the lung masses could not be removed because of its location near a critical blood vessel. Chemotherapy, which is targeted poison, wears down all systems in the body..Kenzie has exhausted the options on radiation and surgery. Chemotherapy is tricky: she has undergone and hit the limits on the most effective treatments. Technically, additional chemotherapies remain – but Kenzie feels that her body has taken all it can take, at least for now.Medical DecisionKenzie, with Mikayel and her family, has studied the options thoroughly. Because conventional medicine is reaching diminishing returns, they have made the decision for Kenzie to undergo non-toxic holistic treatments at a facility in Mexico so that she can regain her strength, continue to fight, and hopefully get healed. Insurance in the US does not cover these alternative approaches, leaving them to fund the effort themselves.We know, and the family is well aware, that these treatments are controversial. What does one do when options dwindle and time runs short? We believe that this is not the time to debate, but instead to support their decision in any way we can.A Team EffortThe costs include $30,400 for treatments, plus $22,500 for a three-week clinic stay including transportation, assessments, and supportive therapies. The family has budgeted an additional $5,000 to cover preparatory treatments, travel, and incidentals, for a campaign total of $57,900.The family will supply the first $15,000 directly to avoid paying fees, stretching their resources more than thin. They need our help to raise the incremental $42,900.About UsWe are Erika and Tom Ngo, friends of Kenzie’s family for more than twenty years. Our children have grown up together and have continued a cousin-like relationship into adulthood. We dearly love Kenzie, Mikayel, and her family.",197,859,11,205,3 months,1 month ago,2 months,2018-09-03

Our prayer is they will feel our love and support through our offering made here. As some of you know, Will has been diagnosed with Lymphoma. This horrible journey began at Thanksgiving last year, when Will started to have pain in his back.  He assumed he had pulled a muscle and started seeing a Chiropractor. When the chiropractic visits didn’t help,he then decided to see an acupuncturist, and this helped short term. The pain elevated from November to January, to the point that Will could not get off the couch, he had no energy and had lost FORTY (40) pounds.After an appointment with an Orthopedic Surgeon, and a MRI that discovered a mass near his spine and many masses all over his organs, the doctor told Will to see an oncologist the next day. From this point, William has received multiple tests to learn he has Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma.There have been many nights at Conroe Regional and MD Anderson because his kidneys continue to shut down. This is a direct result of the Lymphoma. Will and Margaret have had numerous discussions with MD Anderson and they feel along with their team of doctors at MD Anderson that Will is an ideal candidate for a “trial therapy” drug. They have been told that this drug will give Will an 80% chance of survival. Upon learning that this “trial” was available, the Harrison’s diligently completed all the forms that their insurance company required to learn that their CLAIM WAS DENIED AND THEIR INSURANCE WOULD NOT COVER THIS TREATMENT. The MD Anderson team of doctors lowered Will’s survival rate to 40% without this “trial therapy”. Will is a father to two kids in 7th and 11th grade, and husband among the many different titles he holds. How could the Harrisons know that his chances of survival would be cut in half and NOT try to cover it on their own?The decision was made to find a way to pay for the “trial therapy” on their own. The cost of this therapy is a few dollars from $250,000.  This whopping figure does not include the numerous hospital stays or the port that was needed. To date, they have completed phase 1 of the trial and are now starting phase 2. We believe he is improving with these treatments as he has more energy and his kidneys are functioning better.  Will is making progress and we PRAY that HE WILL DEFEAT this! We ask you to please lift Will in prayer. Our God is mighty and able to Heal.Please consider donating to this GO FUND ME that was created to help the Harrisons with the financial stress of this time.

At 11 weeks pregnant with Baby Bray, Amelia was diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer.Since diagnosis, Amelia has met with numerous oncologists, surgeons, and obstetricians.  She’s been scanned, biopsied, poked, and prodded. Cancer has been found in her lymph nodes in addition to her breasts and she’s tested BRCA 2 positive. While we are confident that she has a great team of medical professionals at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center overseeing her treatment and delivery plan, we also know there is a long road ahead.Due to the nature of her cancer -- coupled with the pregnancy – Amelia will be undergoing numerous surgeries and multiple rounds of chemotherapy – both of which will be spread out over time to protect the baby. Additionally, Baby Bray will be joining the world a little earlier than the due date. Which means this new little peanut will be starting life in the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). All of this will be accompanied by extensive medical expenses for Amelia and Baby Bray’s care.Fighting breast cancer is a physical, mental, emotional, and financially draining experience. In Amelia’s case, this toll is much more acute. On top of the obvious medical and associated expenses, the Brays will lose income during the treatments and delivery, as Amelia will substantially exceed her paid time off at the small business where she works.We know how supportive her friends, family, co-workers, and past and present employers have already been as you have heard and shared this news with one another. The Brays are grateful for the love and support being shown to them each and every day.   Amelia, Derek, Avery, and Baby Bray are determined to survive this season of life and look forward to a future as a family of four thriving together, with cancer and NICU stays as a past memory.All funds received will be used to help offset expenses in Amelia’s cancer treatments, Baby Bray’s medical care, and alleviate financial stresses on the Bray family.  Please show your support for mom and baby.

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is a relatively common muscle and soft tissue pediatric cancer. What makes Daniela’s case extremely rare is that it's in her liver. There are only a few cases of this documented and almost none of them are in children. Upon starting kindergarten, Daniela was first diagnosed at the age of 5 and started chemotherapy immediately. Sadly, the first year of chemotherapy didn't kill it all, and now she has started another year of chemotherapy coupled with radiation therapy and immunotherapy. Radiation wasn't an option the first time because the cancer was so large and spread out. It's much smaller this time and she might be a candidate for radiation therapy in a few months.  Additionally, since this is a very rare form of rhabdomyosarcoma, her oncologists are not ruling out a liver transplant if treatment doesn't work. We need to help Daniela and her family. Insurance won't cover genetic testing for immunotherapy, immunotherapy treatment, and won't cover some imaging like mri, etc... Daniela is also the oldest of 4 children. Her mother Katia cares for Daniela full time while her father Anthony has to continue to work to support his family.   Childcare is expensive and they need to employ a full time care taker.  Please, with everyone’s love and support, let’s help the Conte family together.",159,513,2,161,4 months,28 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Fenov Pierre-Louis, known for his trademark smile, optimistic outlook and vast intellect, left this earth on Wednesday, July 18, 2018. If you had the pleasure of meeting Fenov or hearing him speak, you know that he was always the brighest light in the room.This, despite the fact that he had bravely been battling Stage 4 Nueroblastoma kancer since the age of 9. If you spent just 5 minutes talking to Fenov, you walked away feeling better about yourself. Though he had been through innumerable battles in his fight against a vile disease, he always maintained the sunniest of dispositions. He maintained the highest of grades, as evidenced by his  induction into the National Honor Society. This was accomplished despite Fenov missing a great amount of time from school due to his constant treatments. Simply put, Fenov Pierre-Louis was a brilliant and amazing young man.Together with his devoted mother Mathilda, Fenov  bravely faced many ups and downs in his battle with kancer.  Most all of Mathilda's time was devoted to caring for Fenov, ferrying him from their home in New Jersey to his treatments at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) or other area hospitals. Like Fenov, Mathilda always cared for Fenov with a smile on her face. Through his efforts as a Jambassador for the Jam Kancer In The Kan Foundation Fund, his special friendship with New York Islanders star Anders Lee, and his efforts on behalf of Relay for Life at his school, The Academy for Information Technology, Fenov  touched and inspired many people. Videos of him speaking have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times, and so many people have benefited from his words of wisdom. and his positive message. Though he knew his time on earth was limited, he welcomed the opportunity to motivate people. In May of 2018, Fenov penned a poem that included the following words:How I could make a lasting impression upon the earth?I want to make people proud, and inspire with words,And inspire with actions, inspire with who I am,Who would’ve thought that it would start with a speech at a Kancer Jam?We are blessed that Fenov has come into our lives, and we pledge to continue his efforts and carry forth his message.We ask that you consider making a donation to assist Fenov's family in covering his funeral and other expenses they are facing.We thank you for supporting Fenov's family in memory of this amazing young man .Thank you.",226,324,19,228,4 months,13 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She was an instructor on an accelerated free fall level 1 jump. The jump did not go as was planned and practiced on the ground. Emily chased the student through the student’s normal pull altitude, putting aside her safety, catching and deploying their parachute for them around 2,200 feet. Once she was clear of her student, Emily deployed her own parachute. As her main opened, her automatic activation device deployed her reserve also. At approximately 500 feet Emily had two parachutes in a biplane configuration. Between 100 and 200 feet above the ground the parachutes began to separate. She attempted to keep the parachutes above her head as much as possible. Emily impacted the ground about half a mile west-northwest of the drop zone (DZ) on a rocky hillside. Her injuries were serious, but she is still with us! Help from the DZ arrived within ten minutes of impact which included her husband. He stabilized her, addressed her injuries and coordinated life flight. About 50 minutes later she was on her way to Scripps Mercy. Emily’s injuries included: broken left femur (fixed with an IM nail), multiple pelvic fractures, five broken ribs on her left, two broken ribs on her right, a bleed in her left frontal lobe, and two small brain bruises. Emily was unconscious until December 6th when she woke up about 3:30 am and decided to try to take a selfie (with the phone Ricky had fallen asleep next to her in his hand) to see what she looked like with all the tubes in. Emily was at Scripps Mercy until Dec 10th, Navy Medical Center San Diego Balboa through Dec 14th, and finally San Diego Rehab until Dec 23rd when she finally was able to go home. While all of her fractured bones have healed, or are almost fully healed, her brain is struggling. Her traumatic brain injury has escalated to a point which is no longer manageable in the comfort of her own home with her husband taking care of her.  She is both confused and combative. We ask that everyone comes together as a community to help get her the care that her brain needs. In order for her brain to get the proper care it needs to heal, she will need to be in a 24 hour care facility which specializes in traumatic brain injuries as well as cognitive and behavioral therapies. The hope is that in 6 months to 1 year, Emily will be ready to live at home again. Casa Colina in Apply Valley is holding a bed for her. The costs for this care facility are $700-$900 per day, depending on the level of care she will require. We are setting a goal of $200,000 so that she could be covered for at least 6 months of care regardless of insurance input. Emily is a hero.

And may I add one more, Larger than Life (you can see that just by her smile).Mary was diagnosed with colon cancer in January, 2017.  She underwent chemo for 6 months and was then declared cancer free by August 2017.  She questioned a spot that the doctors had seen on her liver that wasn't yet diagnosed as of November, 2017, and after they did a  scan to see what the spot was in February, 2018, it was revealed that she had a recurrence--metastatic Stage 4 cancer that has spread to her liver.  She has 5 tumors on her liver that are shrinking after she has been doing chemo from March to June, 2018. No more tumors are showing up and she will undergo major surgery Wednesday on her liver to section out the areas that have the tumors, followed by more chemo (undetermined amount as of now) to make sure the cancer hasn't and won't spread any further.  Needless to say, it has been a very tough journey for Mary and her family over the last 1 1/2 years and they can't seem to catch a break.  Phil is in between jobs right now and they are having health insurance issues.  We all know the exorbitant cost of healthcare and how it doesn't take much for it to become overwhelming.  Mary really didn't want me to create this page for her because she is not one to ask for anything. EVER.  I am asking on her behalf because I would really like to help her and her family to not have financial stress on top of the stress of being sick.  People are always asking in what way they can help and I thought this would be a great way to show support if you want to.  The funds that are raised will go toward their hefty COBRA insurance payments each month, travel expenses for Phil during the time Mary will be in the hospital (back and forth from CT to NY every day), hospital bills, and to supplement Mary's self-employment income since she has had to decrease her work load over the last year.Thank you so much in advance for looking out for Mary and being one of her angel's on this earth.  Please keep Mary in your thoughts and prayers for this week for a very successful surgery and quick recovery.",160,352,2,159,1 month,1 month ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Unfortunately, all efforts to treat and reverse the damage were ineffective. Philip, who was then a student of Loyola Jesuit College, Abuja, Nigeria, had to be absent from school for a couple terms. Despite this, he graduated with good grades and won an award for his resilience. This was no surprise to me as Philip has always been spirited as evident in our days in primary school at St. Saviours, Ebutte Metta. Philip enrolled in Babcock University where he is studying Computer Science. His kidney function continued to worsen over time until finally in the first quarter of 2017, he reached end stage renal disease and lost all of his kidney function. He eventually commenced dialysis and was advised to plan for a kidney transplant. Due to lack of adequate funding, Philip and his family prepared for the transplant to be done in Nigeria. On the 4th of December 2017, Philip was taken in for the transplant operation but post-surgery, the transplanted kidney did not function as expected. Philip was operated on three times in a period of ten days. Due to several complications, Philip is in urgent need of another kidney transplant as his current condition is quickly deteriorating with symptoms such as muscle weakness and wasting(loss), anemia, lack of appetite, loss of weight and edema just to name a few. His family has been advised against doing the second transplant in Nigeria and is looking into The United States, Germany or India as countries where this surgery has been statistically successful. As was stated earlier, the expenses involved in doing the transplant in the above stated countries are quite difficult for Philip's family alone to bear. This is where we will need the help and support of all you kind hearted individuals who have taken the time to read this. Your generous donations will go a long way in not only financing this transplant but more importantly, granting Philip the chance to have his life back. Thank you in advance for your support. God bless you all.Necessary as per GoFundMe compliance requirements:My name is Chike Udenze and I'm a childhood friend of Philip from Lagos. We attended the same primary and secondary schools in Nigeria but I'm currently based in New York City.

Chris and Jenny continue to put their faith in the Lord and believe that He has a plan for baby Anchor. By the Grace of God and his divine intervention and from all the love and prayers from friends and family they remain hopeful and positive during this trying time. While Jenny and Chris are far away in San Diego supporting baby Anchor, the reality of the financial commitments are setting in.  At first, they thought once baby was born they would be in San Diego for just one more month.  Unfortunately, now they are preparing for what looks like a much longer stay.  Both Jenny and Chris have extremely supportive employers, but at the moment there is no clear end in sight.  Baby Anchor will need multiple heart operations and Jenny will have to remain with him in San Diego anywhere from 6 months or longer.Both Chris and Jenny have given so much to their family, to the paddling community, the life guarding community, to friends who have become family and to their church.  Everyone who knows them, knows they are the ones who give help, not the ones who receive help.We would like to show them our love and support by helping them financially and/or simple thoughts of love and prayer.  Your donation to their GoFundMe page will not only help this beautiful family, but also they would also like to donate a portion of the funds they receive to the Ronald McDonald House Charities.Above all, your love, thoughts and prayers will be the most precious gift of all.  Mahalo e na Akua Mahalo e na kupuna la ea Mahalo me ke aloha la Mahalo me ke aloha la",234,783,10,236,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

Nicky’s tumors are in her liver, which is also called Carcinoid Syndrome (carcinoid.org). Since her initial diagnosis, Nicky has undergone monthly injections with a slow release drug called Oceotride or Lanreotide. Those treatments have not been successful in stopping the growth of her tumors or liver. Nicky was preparing to undergo more intensive treatment beginning this fall.Having been with her the entire previous day, no one could have imagined the sudden, very serious onset of her current condition - but it happened. In essence, her cancer caused a very sudden internal system shutdown.Right now, Nicky is awaiting a blessed union with Jesus, and that is indeed something to celebrate!But, Mitch & their daughters are grieving and preparing for something exceptionally difficult for any family to endure. It is hard. It is emotional. It will also be very expensive. The family has medical insurance with a high deductible and out of pocket. So, while their health insurance will be helpful, a large amount of Nicky’s care will not be fully covered. In addition, the family will no doubt need to bear the costs of Nicky’s funeral and associated services.As a dual income family, the Names’ will also need to adjust to a single wage earner, while still needing to satisfy monthly obligations including a mortgage, car payments, college savings and other normal household expenses.Mitch will no doubt return to work at some point, but until he’s able to make that happen, the family will be needing financial help.

I am a Freshman Composition teacher in the Department of English at Texas State University. I went to Dartmouth College, Class of 2007, where I was a Kappa Kappa Gamma. I'm a mom of two boys, age five and seven and I've recently been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.It started six months about, when I was just so tired, dragging myself up the stairs. I couldn’t pick up my children. I was dropping cups in public. Everything hurt all the time.  Then about two months ago my left side went numb – I lost sensation in my hands, I couldn’t tell if something was hot or cold or if I was putting enough pressure around a plate to hold it. But when you're a single working mom of two little boys, who is also in graduate school, you just kind of ignore things, because who has time to be sick? I was a Division I Varsity Athlete for Dartmouth. I played volleyball, I was Middle Blocker, and I saw myself as invincible. I’d say to myself, ""my right hand still works, I can still write on the board for my students.""  But I was having trouble walking at all, getting shocks down my spine and then about a month and a half ago, at my son Ethan’s fifth birthday party, I could hardly stand. I was too weak even to sit. I was hospitalized and they did several MRIs and it came back that I have lesions in my spine, nerve damage.  My lumbar puncture revealed oligoclonal bands in my cerebral spinal fluid and the doctors said, you have Multiple Sclerosis.MS is a disease in which your own immune system attacks the central nervous system (of the brain and the spine) causing lesions, scars and damage to the nerves. My agility and mobility deteriorated almost immediately. The doctors said, we could try some of the immune suppressor drugs we have come out with over the past 15 years, but my aunt had died six years ago, only 11 years after being diagnosed with MS, taking all those same drugs. The doctors said, these medications will slow, not halt the disease nor will it restore disability lost. And so I was having these terrible conversations with doctors, asking “How much time? How long? How long will I be able to walk, to work?” and thinking at night, who is going to take care of my two little boys?But at Dartmouth I was in the Women in Science Program, and then later at Yale Graduate School (Class of 2012) I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow, so I just started to doing research.  As much as I could get my hands, my fingers to work, I was reading neurology journals, every study that was coming out on MS treatment, therapies, and very quickly I found out about HSCT, Hemoatopoetic Stem Cell Transplant for MS patients.Stem Cell Transplants combined with Chemo have been a standard cancer treatment for decades, but only in the last ten, fifteen years have these stem cell transplants been applied to autoimmune diseases, like MS.  In a nutshell, HSCT doctors harvest your clean, healthy bone marrow stem cells that do not contain the diseased cells attacking your nerves. They then administer chemo to wipe out the diseased immune cells. Last, they give the patient back their own clear, healthy stem cells.  The procedure essentially shuts down the immune system and then turns it back on, with no memory of dysfunction. The results of this procedure are stunning –over 86% of patients find their MS is completely halted, they go into full remission, and are gaining back disabilities that they had lost as their nerves repair themselves and grow healthy. Patients are leaving their canes and wheelchairs in the hospital, walking out, with complete halt of the disease. What’s so great is that this is not an experimental procedure. Since 1967 HSCT has been done more than two million times around the world, and is to date the most effective treatment to durably halt underlying disease activity and progression of MS.For the science-inclined, I’ve included links to the scientific journals highlighting the methods and success of this procedure:  https://www.bbc.com/news/health-35065905 https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/11/2776/4002732 https://www.bbc.com/news/health-36490315I've reached out to doctors doing this treatment, both in America and abroad, and it turns out I’m an excellent candidate for HSCT. Being as young as I am and newly diagnosed, if I get this HSCT treatment I have over a 90% likelihood of going into full remission, including regaining impairments that I’ve lost the last weeks.  They are doing trials on this treatment in Chicago, but it is about ten years away from being offered to the average American and unfortunately I don’t have that time. In America disability index is categorized on a scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the most disabled, and in three weeks my index went from 2 to a 5.I have found a hospital with an excellent safety profiles and over a decade of experience in providing just this treatment that is willing to do this amazing procedure on me. There is an urgency in the fact that the sooner I can get this treatment the better my odds are.  The treatment to travel to the hospital and stay for 28 days where I will have my own stem cells taken out, receive chemotherapy, and then have my stem cells put back into me will cost $89,000.  Despite the very large amount, which is so very intimidating to me as well, I want to say that no donation is too small, every little bit does help me closer.If I am fortunate to raise more, I will use the funds to hire help to make sure the boys are well cared for now, while my mobility is limited, and also when I am in the hospital getting this treatment, so the boys needs are met until I can get better.The daily pain I'm in is very, very hard, but definitely the hardest part of this has been to see the burden of my MS disease fall on the boys.  Having my seven year old joey standing on a stool to make breakfast for his five year old brother because I’m in too much pain or unable to stand long enough to toast a bagel. Telling my children I can’t pick you up, I can’t chase you, I can’t walk you to see the neighborhood cat, having to spend most of our time together laying down.  And you know, my seven-year-old especially is very aware. He’s very worried, saying things like, “Mommy what’s going to happen to us?” and that’s when I realized I can’t be embarrassed, not now, to reach out and ask for help and say I need help – I’ve recently had to go on leave from my job as an English Instructor because my health is too poor to teach. If you can help us, we are truly grateful.I want to add, that the people who know me know that I am a determined person and also a very hopeful person. I see a situation and I just see that there must be a way out. I don’t really accept that there isn’t a way out, and I do what it takes to find that way out and in my case, difficult as it is, there is a way out, this wonderful HSCT treatment for which I’m an excellent candidate and I just want to let you know that if you can help me get this treatment, I won’t let you down. I’ll be back here in 6 months, sharing a video of me back in the classroom, on the track and most importantly, taking care of these little boys that I’m so lucky to have.Thank you so much for reading and donating, or even just sharing my link. If you can send it to groups in your community or post on facebook, that helps me so much. I am so grateful, and my children are grateful.Thank you so much, God Bless.",270,637,0,270,11 days,2 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Since our first mission in 2003, when we performed the first surgical intervention for hydrocephalus in Haiti, we have provided care for over 1000 children suffering from hydrocephalus. We do realize that this, indeed, is a small fraction of the neurosurgical need of the children of Haiti.Our goal in Haiti is to improve awareness, train the Haitian surgeons to become self-reliant and help manage the neurosurgical needs of their children. And while we work towards that goal, we want to continue to be in Haiti and help the children and their families with their neurosurgical needs. The most common disease these children suffer from is hydrocephalus: a neurological disorder where excess brain fluid fills the cavities of the brain which in turn leads to an enlarged head. Several surgeries can be done to fix this, each taking more than a couple hours. In our short trip of 3 days, we are able to help only 18-20 of these children who need it most. However, there are many other diseases where neurosurgical interventions will be needed once the infrastructure is improved.Due to the brevity of our trips, we are able to reach out to only a small population of children who need our help. As a result, we are looking for donations to help continue our support for the children in Haiti by sending a team to Haiti at least once a month and continue to train the local Haitian surgeons. Your donation, no matter how small, would be greatly appreciated as we work towards our goal.",123,339,0,124,5 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

On December 1, 2017, a single CT scan changed everything. At just 17 years old, Maddy was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Four months of chemo would begin to shrink the tumor that had been growing around her heart from 90 cm, to 12 cm. Unfortunately, the tumor grew back to 20 cm during the following two months of chemo. This prompted a surgical procedure and a change in her treatment plan, only it hasn’t worked. Maddy’s cancer battle has now landed her at MD Anderson Hospital, in Houston TX. Doctors are now completing their final tests to confirm what they suspect to be, Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. So many people, family and friends, have been incredible over the past 8 months, more than words could ever do any justice; so many of you also, have been asking what you can do to help. Here is where humility has become mandatory for the Rodell’s. All of Maddy’s care and treatment will now be taking place in Houston. The immediate plan has been set at 6 months, and is likely to involve a stem cell transplant. Currently, it is unknown if Maddy will have any time to come home during this time period or not; Doctors are advising at the moment that she stay in Houston. This elongated stay, along with the expected travel expenses that will follow, is quickly creating a challenge; it’s creating a challenge that we are asking you to help with. The ask is that no one would over extend themselves financially; but rather, together when we all pull in the same direction with what we can, we might eliminate this challenge and allow the Rodell’s to focus on the mountain they’ve found themselves climbing. Maddy’s Bible verse is Psalm 46:5, “God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.” We, our entire family, are prayer warriors; we would ask you to join us. Our faith is strong and our hope is high. Maddy would tell you, “It may look like I’m surrounded, but I’m surrounded by You.” We’re praising God in the valley as He continues to bear fruit. On behalf of the Rodell’s, thank you so much, and God Bless.",259,1.9k,14,253,2 months,21 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Chemotherapy has begun, along with other drug treatments. This will be followed up by an assessment to determine if he is eligible for a stem cell transplant. We are hopeful this will be an option for him, as this is the only real way to cure this type of cancer. ""Maintenance"" for this type of cancer can go on for years, depending on how the body responds. He may also need more than one transplant to be successful. But these questions will only be answered with time. Brittany is in Nashville with Matt to love and serve him during his care there.

We are grateful that Matt has insurance that is already helping with the rising costs of his care, however, there is a cap on payouts for his care. We have set a goal for $250,000 to help cover these additional costs of his cancer treatments. Matt also needs prayer for healing, as well as strength, while he goes through this process.  We give praise for what the Lord has already done and what He will continue to do as Matt moves through this. ""Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer."" - Romans 12:12GoalOur goal with this fundraiser is to take the stress and anxiety out of finances, both current and future needs, so that Matt can focus on healing and Brittany can be available to care for him throughout. This will include living expenses for the next few months, as neither of them will be working, bills/treatments that aren't covered once insurance runs out, and future treatments that are yet to be determined.  Thank YouMatt has given his life to loving others, whether through ministry, coaching track, or just being a friend.

Her cancer has made a comeback in a BIG way. It has spread into her lungs and liver, and mostly into her bones. She is currently in the hospital and is hoping to be released soon. However, she is unable to walk (the cancer has all but obliterated the left side of her pelvis). She hopes to be going home in a motorized wheelchair. As you know, she has battled and beat cancer before. She is very positive she will do it again, but it is going to be a long, suffering battle this time around. But, if ANYBODY can do it, ANNA CAN!!!! Only a week ago, Anna was walking with a limp and a dull pain in her hip. This has escalated so fast, that she can no longer bear any weight on her left side - AND she can no longer move her left leg without excruciating pain. This is what has rendered her immobile. And this is what she hopes to treat and to, somehow, find a way to become mobile again. Anna is seriously considering traveling to the Hope4Cancer clinic in Mexico ( https://hope4cancer.com/) to treat her condition in a holistic way. They have a shuttle from the San Diego airport directly to the clinic 30 minutes away. But, due to her limitations, she may not be able to get there at this time. She is hoping to get stronger and for her bone to regenerate so she can get mobile and get healthy again. Life is going to be looking very different for the Parrs for the forseeable future. For now, Anna is at Longmont United Hospital, running more tests and working with an orthopedist to stabilize her bones. After that, she would like to move to a rehab facility before going home. Any donated funds will help the family with Anna's mounting medical bills and day-to-day life for their family. We have also set up a meal train ( https://mealtrain.com/eyq3wy) if anybody wants to bring them a meal and/or send over gift cards for take-out and the like. Most of all, please PRAY for Anna and the rest of her family. She and her husband Shannon (Eric Shannon Parr) are so very thankful for any generosity (monetary or not), including your prayers.  Their daughters Anika (11), Mikayla (9) and Justine (7) just want to see their mom get better so they can continue their nightly dance parties under the disco ball. Let's shower the Parr family with our love and generosity.

I remember when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans; my sister, who was 10 at the time, went around our neighborhood with a wagon knocking on doors and asking for food donations. She was just so desperate to help anyway she could.Gabrielle has always been that way. As a kid she would ask for donations instead of birthday presents. She would host blanket-making parties as a teenager to provide warmth for patients in hospice homes. Today you can find her dressing up as a Disney princess to bring smiles to the faces of sick children in the Orlando area.  When someone needs help, she will move mountains to help them. Well, now she needs our help.(Gabrielle dressed as Rapunzel for the Runway  to Hope charity event)On Tuesday, June 12th Gabrielle was working at a trade show when at about 3:00pm Orlando time she had stomach cramps and went off to the bathroom. She was alarmed to find a significant amount of blood in her stool. She immediately left work and went home where she had several severe bouts of the same bloody stools and eventually became unconscious on the bathroom floor.Luckily, Gabrielle regained consciousness and called a friend to take her to the hospital.  However, as they tried to get her to the car, Gabrielle passed out again in the driveway. Unable to get her into the car and noticing she was losing a lot of blood, her friend made the choice to call an ambulance. She was taken to the nearest hospital and was admitted into the ICU being treated for significant blood loss (her hemoglobin was only 5 g/dl) via three blood transfusions. The doctors focused on getting her stabilized as they tried to figure out what was happening. The preliminary diagnosis was a bleeding stomach ulcer, but that was just an early guess.At 5:00am  on Wednesday, June 13th Gabrielle went into surgery. The doctors did an endoscopy and found not an ulcer but an enlargement of the connecting area between two blood vessels in her upper intestines which had hemorrhaged and bled into her intestines, causing the bloody stools and blood loss.  The surgeons stopped the bleeding by cauterization endoscopically.This is a condition called Arteriovenous malformation. This condition is not caused by external things like NSAID use as ulcers are, but rather is something someone is born with.  The doctors said many people have it and live their whole lives without a hemorrhage happening, while some experience ruptures throughout their lives. We pray this is a one time rupture.We are so thankful that Gabrielle was able to get to the hospital and get the help she needed; without it she would have bled out and the unthinkable would have happened. But with all hospital visits comes a bill, and unfortunately Gabrielle does not have health insurance.Gabrielle moved from Minnesota to Orlando shortly after high school to fulfill her dream of working for Disney and performing. As any artist knows, the life of a performer is not glamorous or easy, but she has the drive to achieve greatness. She is a hard worker and works many different oddball jobs, often working over 40 hours a week in total. She lives modestly, and is completely financially independent. (Gabrielle working her favorite job, a D.J. for Disney's Animal Kingdom) (Gabrielle working as a blackjack dealer for an event company)Even with her many jobs, Gabrielle struggles  to make ends meet and can't afford health insurance. Even with the Affordable Care Act raising the age a child can be covered by a parent's plan, my parents health insurance does not cover anything in Florida, so she is on her own. ( The whole clan! Thank goodness mom was able to get to FL to be with her when we couldn't be )Nobody expects to be in the hospital for an emergency like this, especially not a 24 year-old healthy woman. Between the ambulance trip, the blood transfusions, and the surgery; she is going to have many hospital bills she will not be able to pay on her own. This is just the tip of the iceberg as well, for we don't know how long she will be in the hospital or how much work she will miss. Her employment is all contract work with no sick pay or workman’s compensation. Financially, there could not be a worse situation for her, but you can help her. This is where I ask you to please donate. If I could give her my insurance I would. If I could sell an arm to get the money I would (anybody want to buy an arm...?) But this might be our best and only option. Any amount you can give to help her would be greatly appreciated. The more you give, the more she can rest stress-free and heal faster. She gives so much of herself to other people, it's about time she sees that generosity returned.I will continue to post updates as we learn more information. For now it looks like she will be in the hospital for at least 3 days, keep checking to see her progress.

In August of 2017, Jackie woke up on what seemed like a typical day, headed to the doctor for a pre-op visit for another minor medical procedure. However, what happened in the days following the visit to the doctor was not typical at all. After noticing a discoloration in her eyes, Jackie proceeded to the doctor and was immediately admitted to the hospital.  After several tests we received the news that rocked our family. Jackie was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer-one of the most aggressive forms of cancer that exist. Her only son, wanting the best for his mom, immediately went into action and located the best doctor in Miami and placed her under his care. Since her diagnosis she has undergone chemo therapy and been hospitalized with numerous medical issues related to the cancer and chemo treatment, and with God's healing touch the tumor has started to shrink. Because of where the tumor is located on her pancreas (encasing a major blood vessel) she is not able to undergo traditional surgery to have it removed. Her doctor recently recommended that she see a specialist that performs a cutting-edge procedure called NanoKnife. It is a minimally invasive treatment procedure for inoperable tumors such as hers. Our family has been praying without ceasing that she would be eligible for the procedure-for we know that God truly answers prayers!! In April, our prayers were answered!!! Jackie found out that her insurance will cover most of the hospital bills and medications but will not cover the physician fee. So we held our breath.... and we were told that the uncovered fee is $25,000. This fee must be paid in full before the procedure can be scheduled and performed. As you can imagine, with this unforeseen medical diagnosis, Jackie's current medical bills are growing and she has had to retire from her job at Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines International after 26 ½ years.  The family has been working together to help financially, physically, and spiritually throughout the last 8 months. And it is with a humble heart that we are reaching out to our family and friends to help us raise the $25,000 needed to cover this procedure.To know Jackie is to love Jackie.  She is always willing to help others; whether it is taking the time to visit others when they are sick or sending a thoughtful gift for special occasions, she loves doing for others.  During basketball season, you can always find Jackie cheering and couch-coaching her favorite team, the Miami Heat. She loves to bake and is an all-around fun spirited person.  She needs our support now and we can't help but want to do all we can to help her fight this horrible disease. If you find it in your heart and are able to assist in any fashion with our fundraising efforts, please know that you will be helping one of God’s children continue to be a blessing to others as she always has. Our family thanks you for any assistance that you may provide. Please feel free to pass this page on to anyone or organization that you feel may be interested in helping Jackie.

Steve had the ability to make everyone around him feel good with his humor and sarcasm, despite the odds he was facing.A few days earlier, in the presence of the chaplain and social worker, Steve’s family and friends surrounded his bed at what they thought were their final moments together.

Our goal is to raise $25,000 within the next few weeks, as time is critical!On behalf of Brett, Jennifer, and their 2 adorable boys, Jack and Michael, thank you for your time and consideration in supporting the Ploessel family during this life changing event.  Your generosity will play a critical role in assuring Brett can beat this life challenge and enjoy the many years ahead with his loving family that he so deserves!",134,251,2,134,1 month,3 days ago,22 days,2018-09-03

My family and I are raising funds to cover treatment costs for our mother Leslie Crisp who was quite suddenly diagnosed with a Stage 4 fast spreading cancer that appears to be concentrated in her omentum and right lung. Leslie has chosen to follow an alternate treatment path that will offer her a higher success rate of regaining her health and vitality. Due to the severity of this diagnosis, we have to act fast and have been forced to raise funds in order to save her life!On March 2nd of this year, my mother went to her doctor complaining of abdominal pain and a decreasing appetite. She was a supposedly healthy woman in her early 60's who devoted her life to the study of health, nutrition, yoga and sharing this knowledge and experience with family and many others connected to her life. On April 20th, a little over a month later, she was diagnosed with a Stage 4 ""non-differentiated abno/carcinoma"" apparent in her omentum from an undetermined source. The proposed treatment plan of chemotherapy, major surgery, followed by more chemotherapy only offers a 20% rate of success. She was also told she would have an approximate life expectancy of 6 months, should she decide to refuse treatment. The donated funds will go directly toward the diagnostic procedures and treatment of out of pocket expenses incurred so far(approx. $10,000), the 3 week cancer treatment protocol at CHIPSA Hospital in Playas Tijuana (approx. $33,427) and any extra needed to cover travel and a year's supply of therapy protocol necessary to continue her treatments at home. Leslie urges you to please go to the link under updates and listen to the documentary about the hospital where she will be receiving her cancer treatments. Leslie is determined to continue living a healthy vibrant life surrounded by grandchildren and those dear to her heart. She hopes to share her cancer story with many others who need to know that holistic, cutting edge cancer treatment therapies exist that are having impressive long term rates of success. Cancer patients need to view cancer as a divine tap on the shoulder that doesn't have to be a death sentence and with the proper support systems in place can lead to a life of deeper clarity and purpose.Leslie and all of her family members would like to express their sincere gratitude for every beautiful soul who has taken the time to express their love and support through prayers,kind thoughtful expression, donations and sharing this story with others who would like to join this healing partnership to fight for saving a cancer victim's life.",192,353,6,207,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,78,Help Ryan Baker Heal From Coma,https://www.gofundme.com/help-Ryan-baker-heal-from-coma,"BOSTON, MA","March 20, 2018","$100,000","$27,225","Be part of Ryan Baker's MIRACLE.On February 26, 2018 Ryan was driving home from work and was in a head-on collision just outside of his neighborhood. The impact of the car accident caused Ryan's brain to sustain a severe injury known as diffuse axonal shearing. The injury left him in a coma and he was life flighted from the scene of the accident to the trauma ICU. After several weeks at the hospital, Ryan's insurance has transferred him to a hospital much farther away. Because family support has a major impact on your level of recovery, his wife has had to relocate near the hospital to continue to be by his side.  Without outside donations, Jennifer will be unable to stay by his side, unable to pay their mortgage, and unable to give him the best care. Even with great medical insurance, the costs of his injuries are devastating. He will be in long term care and rehab for many, many months. Ryan is the sole financial provider for his family because Jennifer was diagnosed with leukemia shortly into their marriage,  and they have already struggled to pay those medical bills and living expenses. When Ryan wakes up, we want him to worry about getting better and have as little financial stress as possible. We are continually grateful for the prayers on Ryan's behalf and see small miracles every day. While he is still in a coma, Ryan has begun to open his eyes and respond to simple commands. Despite the long road ahead, we have great hope for his recovery.Ryan has always been a giver and never expects handouts. Throughout his life, he has served his family and community in countless ways. He was an Eagle Scout by age 16, spent two years of his life as a missionary in Brazil, and at the time of his accident was serving as the Sunday School teacher for the 3- and 4-year-olds in his local church congregation. This is our chance to give back to the man who has given us so much.The funds raised will be used to cover medical and living expenses while Ryan is unable to work.Ryan and Jennifer are beyond appreciative of any donations you may be able to offer. And if you cannot contribute financially, please share this page and encourage others to read his story and donate what they can. Thank you, and above all else, please pray! We believe miracles are real, and we can all be part of this one.(The creator of this GoFundMe page is Ryan's sister, Katie Gulbrandsen. Ryan's father, Matthew Baker, will be helping manage the campaign's donations until Ryan is mindfully fit to do so himself.)",274,1.5k,5,266,5 months,3 mins ago,-1,2018-09-03
