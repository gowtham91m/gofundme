Medical,1,Olivia Stoy:Transplant & Liv it up!,https://www.gofundme.com/olivia-stoy-bone-marrow-transplant,"ASHLEY, IN","May 18, 2018",$1.0M,"$316,576","Update: Many fundraisers have been put into place to raise funds for the Stoy Family to cover the cost of the transplant. Nearly a month into fundraising, Olivia's story had reached so many people that the initial goal was met! $350,000 was the cost of the initial procedure and does not include additional treatment: hospital stays longer than the allotted 50 days, medications, time off of work, and travel expenses. Depending on how fast Olivia's health progresses after the transplant, additional bills could add up fast. Now, Olivia wants to use this experience to bring light to childhood cancer and raise additional money for other children in medical battles of their own. As a result, she created Liv It Up , a campaign designed to shed light on the struggles of childhood cancer through her own personal experiences and those of families she has met along the way. In an effort to help her through the recovery process, Olivia wants to raise $1 million for Liv It Up, to help give young cancer patients a chance at being a kid and their parents the peace of mind that they will have help paying for life-saving medical treatments like Olivia's.Olivia Stoy was an active 12 year old girl, finishing her first year at Angola Middle School. What was thought to be a lingering cold turned out to be something much more serious. Olivia was sent from a local hospital to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and was eventually diagnosed with T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.  Right away, her team of doctors worked on her treatment plan.  Of course, there were a few bumps in the road: a chemo medication that at normal strength caused Olivia to have seizures; an infection which meant an automatic 2 week stay in the hospital; not to mention all of the trips to and from Riley in between those events.  But after all the ups and downs on February 14, 2017 Olivia was declared cancer free but would need to continue treatments through September 2018 to increase the chances of her cancer not returning.During this time, many people asked how they could help, how could they donate. The Stoy family was not in need of funds at the time and Olivia wanted to make sure other kids could benefit from the work of the Child Life Specialists at Riley and Cancer Research. All money was directed to the Riley Foundation where Olivia chose it’s route. To date, over $50,000 has been donated to Riley in Olivia’s name. In March 2018, just one year after celebrating Olivia being cancer free, Olivia’s cancer returned. It was devastating for all who followed her story. Right away the doctors at Riley worked on a plan for Olivia’s relapse. The plan consisted of several rounds of chemotherapy and once the cancer is gone a bone marrow transplant will be needed. After testing members of Olivia’s immediate family, her brother was found to be a 100% match! The Stoy family is part of a faith sharing insurance plan that does not cover organ transplants, including bone marrow transplants. While the family has appealed to the insurance board, on May 14, 2018 the sharing/insurance plan declined coverage of the bone marrow transplant which is the recommended treatment option by doctors at Riley Hospital for Olivia’s survival.We are fundraising for the Stoy Family to help cover the cost of the bone marrow transplant. The original estimate is $900,000. The family has negotiated a price with the hospital and needs to raise $350,000 before for the bone marrow transplant can take place which is estimated to begin July 2018. Should any complication arise during Olivia’s treatment additional funds will be needed. If funds are raised that exceed the amount needed for the bone marrow transplant, the hope is that this fund can provide to other childhood cancer patients and their families for years to come in honor of Olivia Stoy, a true fighter and inspiration to so many!Tax deductible checks can be made out to “Liv it Up” and mailed to Pleasant Lake Mennonite Church | c/o Liv It Up | 5142 S.

Medical,1,Claire Wineland Needs Our Help,https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire,"GARDEN GROVE, CA","June 12, 2018","$225,000","$264,710","First of all, WOW!! We have been blown away by the amazing outpouring of love and support you have shown to Claire..deeply humbled in fact.  Friends have encouraged us to raise the goal to meet the demand but I want everyone to know that our transplant finances have been covered in full.  Anything additional you choose to donate will be to show Claire your love and to help her do something amazing post transplant.  She is full of wonderful ideas but first new lungs, then look out world! :) <3 ""Death is inevitable, but living a life we are proud of is something we can control"". ~ Claire Wineland Some of you may have heard one of Claire Wineland's  many inspirational speeches at events such as PTTOW, THRIVE: Make Money Matter, WORLDZ, Zappos, Klick Health, TEDx, OMED and AARC or possibly you follow her on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram   or YouTube  but one thing about her is she never asks for help for herself, she is a stubborn little force of nature and determined to  live her life to the fullest despite her failing health and is always, always of service to others and shares her message far and wide. This last year, her decline due to having Cystic Fibrosis  (CF) has been drastic.  She is unable to do the work that she loves, which is traveling the world to share her message with thousands of people, she is using a wheelchair due to shortness of breath to walk more than 100ft and her quality of life has become just about staying alive. ￼ This is not the Claire we all know and love. ￼  She has recently been placed on the UCSD Lung Transplant list and is anxiously awaiting the call for new lungs.  A new start, a new chapter #metamorphosis.  Again, we want to make sure that everyone knows this money will not be used for the transplant itself, we do have medical insurance. But the ancillary costs  and medication co pays before, during and after can be considerable, and as you know, she is already struggling to make ends meet and is unable to work. Full recovery can take approximately 6 months post transplant, barring any complications or rejection.We will keep you posted as to her progress! Right now, the doctors say she needs to gain some weight in order to bring down additional risk factors. Did you know that CFers need 5,000 calories a day just to maintain their weight? This is why we started this Go Fund Me page ~ to give her the support she needs up to and beyond transplant for at least 6  months.   Since the transplant will take place in San Diego and she currently lives in Los Angeles, she needs to rent an apartment for 3 to 6 months post transplant as well as pay her rent and living expenses until the big day comes since she is no longer able to work to support herself.  We are thrilled that lungs are on the way but she needs a community to help cover all of the endless expenses involved.  The back and forth to San Diego appointments, the hotels, her current living expenses etc.. We hope that she has inspired you with her endless positivity, sense of humor and charitable work through a non profit she founded at 13 years old, Claire's Place Foundation which ironically helps other CF children and families in the way that she herself needs now.  If you don't know Claire, please take a minute to Google  her name and see some of her videos on line and on social media as well as a beautiful episode on The CWs ""My Last Days, Season 1 "" Directed by Justin Baldoni  and Wayfarer Entertainment. ￼ CNN  has done 2 stories covering her journey for 2 years now and will continue to cover her experience pre and post lung transplant to spread awareness about the process and what people with Cystic Fibrosis go through. Even as her lungs fail, she is still willing to share her experience in the hope of helping another young adult with CF who may be considering a lung transplant. Claire was recently named Glamour Magazine's College Woman of the Year Grand Prize Winner 2018   for her work in advocacy and charity.  Behind the scenes, she struggles for breath and is currently in end stage lung disease, but that is not the face she shows the world. ￼ Please, consider making a donation today so that we can relieve the stress she is feeling about not being well enough to continue working until transplant and possibly up to a year post transplant. What would be most helpful is if  you could make a 10 - 30 second video about how you have been inspired by Claire and then share that video along with this link to your community and social media following.  I am sure with your help, we can reach and maybe even beat this goal.   https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire with hashtag #TeamClaire Thank you so much for your support!  Please do share with followers, friends and family that you feel might be inspired to support as well. Your donations will be deposited in to a private account for Claire and used to pay her rent and expenses over the next 6 to 18 months so she can simply focus on this next huge step while she is so ill.  Specifically travel money, hotels, medications, apartment rental pre transplant here in Los Angeles and post transplant in San Diego, food and other necessities for Claire.Warmly, #TeamClaire ""Truly honored to have lived, failed and accomplished in the ways I have"" ~ Claire WIneland ￼

She is a self less soul who always places the happiness of others above hers.When she got pregnant the 2nd time, we were excited as friends to see the baby boy. She got herself checked in for delivery at Stanford medical facility - Dublin the night of 16th May 2018. Its been 65 days but Ganga hasn’t returned home. Ganga went through 2 cardiac arrests, brain damage and has been in coma and a partial vegetative state past 65 days. Ganga was diagnosed with AFE (amniotic fluid embolism). A rare childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid, enters the blood stream of the mother to trigger a serious reaction. When she was awaiting delivery the night of, the amniotic fluid percolated into her system putting her heart through 2 cardiac arrests. The CPR brought her back temporarily but the fluid mixed blood had affected the brain pushing her into coma.Her husband Sriram, our dear friend has not left her side since that day. It kills him to watch the enigma of his life, lying unresponsive to the very voices that filled her life. Her little child still thinks her mom is just unwell and will come back and hug her soon, the baby boy Rithvin has not felt the touch of his dear mother till this day.At this heart wrenching moment, we would like your help to keep Ganga in the facility, so she receives the much needed treatment to recover. The family has undergone unimaginable trauma in a matter of hours and its been 65 days of suffering.Our hopes are high, she is taking baby steps of progress now, she opens her eyes, but can’t process her surrounding yet. She can hear you speak but cannot respond yet. But we are happy she has progressed thus far. We seek your help to continue the treatment and hospital care such that our Ganga returns back to us the way she was in fullness and health. Her little children have suffered enough and should be able to re-unite with their mother soon.

She had lower abdominal pain all summer long, and just before going back to finish her final year at Covenant College in Georgia, she went for a check up at her gynocologist to check for orvarian cysts. During a laproscopic procedure the cancer was discovered. After meeting several oncologists, Hanna felt strongly that she needed to pursue a natural approach to dealing with the disease. She was able to enter into the care of some of the best alternative doctors available who felt confident they could help her. And so, over the past 6 months Hanna has pursued every avenue of homeopathic treatments, traveling to doctors around the tri-state area every day of the week, sometimes two in one day. We found out two weeks ago that the the tumors in Hanna's abdomen have grown from 3 CM to 17.5 CM - and have englufed her bladder, uterus, ovaries and affected part of her liver. It was made clear to her and my family that surgery is required immediately.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:Hanna met with THE top surgeon for this type of cancer in Washington D.C. and he has an opening available to perform surgery this Thursday, March 8, 2018, before he takes a leave of absence. But, our insurance will only cover procedures within the state of New Jersey. We need to raise the funds to get this procedure done this week. We have no time to waste chasing down the insurance company. All donations will be put into the bank account of Hanna's mom - Hope, as she is sparing Hanna the financial burden as Hanna fights for her life. Throughout this entire experience, Hanna has remained steadfast and hopeful, which we credit to God and the immensely supportive community of friends and family who have come alongside her, prayed for her and sent notes of encouragement to Hanna. We recognize this is an incredible amount of money to try and raise in such a short amount of time, but her life depends on it. We believe that God is bigger than cancer, and that everything is possible through Him. So, we are hoping and believing for the impossible - and would be so grateful for anything you can do to help financially and by sharing this page.",2.7k,3.7k,14,"2,705",6 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATES|| 8/06/2018 - 1930 MST|| Jake is enjoying his recovery in Dhahran and slowly getting back to normal: spending time at the student center and getting back into a daily routine. Last weekend was a weekend of firsts. First time driving, first time in the water, and first time throwing a frisbee! || 7/17/2018 - 0149 GMT+2 || Jake had a great time watching the World Cup Final with his students at the Student Center yesterday evening. Jake continues to be active in working towards his recovery. He has been doing PT at home with his Mom and brother Caleb coaching him everyday. There have been ongoing medical appointments and things are moving in a good direction. Again, thanks for everything, ALL of the support has been nothing short of amazing!|| 7/12/2018 - 1638 MDT || Jake is continuing his recovery back in Dhahran. The main goal currently is to reduce the swelling in the residual limb and he has already seen some progress. He has been awarded a new and more suitable house form Aramco, which he appreciates very much! The move is still in progress, but a big shout out to all the people who have already lended a hand! 


The food train has been an absolute blessing and he is eating quite well! The best news of all is that his Mom (Robbin) and Caleb (his brother) have arrived to Saudi!|| 7/7/2018 - 2200 MDT || Jake is starting to feel more at home again in his community. He's very happy to be back and has enjoyed catching up with a few people and slowly getting back into a more normal routine. Aramco is in the process of finding him a more suitable living arrangement as well, something that is a single-floor. Yes, he also went back today to teach his first fitness class! Here are a few pics from him driving with a colleague to look for a new place as well as him with his fitness class. || 7/4/2018 - 1800 MDT || Jake is SUPER happy to be back in Dhahran in his community! However, the heat is NO JOKE over there and forgetting your sunglasses doesn't make it any easier on a 110+ degree day! (Pic below) He's very happy to be back in an environment where he is familiar with the medical staff that is treating him. He is also very thankful for the meal train that has been initiated for him (link:  https://www.mealtrain.com/trains/zv21gd ). More to come later and he's still not quite ready for visitors, but thinks that next week may be the week.|| 7/3/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jake has safely made it back to his community in Dhahran! It's amazing that he was able to move himself so early. He told me that it was pretty wild to think that he was undergoing surgery for the amputation of his leg less than 5 days ago, and he was now using crutches to move across the tarmac and board a plane! It took a tremendous amount of energy for him, so he is still resting quite a bit, but Jake is excited to start seeing everyone soon! Now that he is back in his home community, they have organized meals for him which he is beyond excited about! Pics to come later! || 7/2/2018 - 1400 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake earlier today and he is ON THE MOVE! He departed the hospital in Jeddah earlier today and is on the plane on the way back to Dhahran! He is SUPER excited to be back in the community and to continue this road to recovery. He asked me to share a few pictures of him on the move today. More to come soon with his updates, and I don't know when he'll be ready to start seeing visitors, but I know everyone is anxious to see him. I'll be sure to let everyone know as soon as he feels up to it. BTW - can you believe how good he already is on crutches?!?!BTW - Yes, I realize that some of the photos are sideways :) I'll eventually figure out how to get them straightened out without cropping out half of the photo! || 7/1/2018 - 1600 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake a few times today and he has a lot of positive news he would like to share! He has a few pictures to share as well. The first picture is of Jake cleaning himself up a bit, getting his hair washed and just sitting up for a while! The second is of him learning to balance himself on crutches and moving around, a LOT! The third is of him receiving his latest blood transfusion. Which, we have also received the results from, and his levels are stable enough now for a short term air travel back to the hospital in Dhahran (where he lives and his community is). He is hoping to get fly there tomorrow pending any other complications! As always, he is in great spirits despite the circumstances, and is SUPER thankful for the support. Again, huge shout out to Sarah who has not left his side and has been a tremendous advocate for Jake the last few days. Not to mention all the of support that Aramco and all of his friends/family are helping with behind the scenes .|| 7/1/2018 - 0400 MDT || ""You got to Move it Move it"" is the theme of Jake's day today! He called me (Caleb) this morning to inform me that he was moving under his own power with crutches. He was able to get out of the bed and do a little bathing (which we know both Jake and Sarah were grateful for). His energy levels are much higher today than yesterday. His body has accepted both blood transfusions that they gave him over the last 30 hours, which takes a lot of time and requires very frequent monitoring making it tough for Jake to rest. He is moving more towards stability Pics to come soon! || 6/30/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jeremy (Jakes brother) spoke with Jake this morning. We are all really impressed that he is up and moving! He was able to get out of his bed yesterday and got to start working on his balance. Jake said, ""It's a little weird, my body has a new center of gravity now"". It was a LOT of effort for him to be up and moving yesterday. Today, he has been taking a little rest from all that work, and has his focus set clearly on catching up on all the World Cup games that he's been missing! Here's a photo of Jake's current status. || 6/29/2018 - 1100 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake this morning and he is up and moving! He has been making great progress, which none of use every doubted that he would for a second. They were able to take the catheter out this morning (which Jake is thankful for) and he is starting to move around. His spirit is unbreakable and unbelievably positive. Also, he wanted to share a few photos for everyone. He also wanted to let people know he stood up under his OWN POWER using the bars that they installed. Sarah has been a rockstar as well and there with Jake supporting him and pushing him right along into the recovery! He's super thankful for everything and is doing his best to respond to messages as he has the time and energy.

|| 6/28/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake today and he is in great spirits! He managed to get some good laughs in with Jake and talked about how he is doing. Jake said that the highlight of his day was a giant bag of cherries which he devoured! He is getting his appetite back and is becoming more stable every day. He is still not in a good position to accept visitors, but we all know that with his big personality, it won't be long! All of your support is appreciated and I'm certain that all of us together are making a big difference.|| 6/28/2018 - 0800 MDT || The family spoke with Jake this morning. He is overwhelmed by all of the support and expressed his thanks for all of it. He know's its tough, but he asked for NO VISITORS at the current time. He is still very focused on the recovery and will advise the family when he is able to accept visitors. Thank you again for all of your support and understanding. || 6/27/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb (Jake's brother) spoke with Jake tonight. He's in great spirits and appreciates the overwhelming love and support from everyone. He is stable at the hospital in East Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He's been getting good rest and has someone with him 24/7. Please try not to overwhelm him as he's resting. The family will be providing accurate updates on this page.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The family is managing the online side of this GoFundMe page.

The current prognosis is that she will never walk again.Victoria retains complete mental capacity as well as the use of her head, neck and arms. Doctors have assured us that, with intense physical therapy, she can regain her daily independence and care for herself and her family, drive her children to school and return to work full time, but that her life will look “very different.""    Victoria and her husband, Troy Burk, and their children Ana (10), Tafe (9), and Zoe (2½), love living in Westport and are so touched by the outpouring of love and well wishes they have received from the community in the past few days.  So many people want to know how they can help. Victoria is committed to her family, her town and her career, and is fiercely determined to live a full life by regaining as much mobility as her body will allow. She comes from a family with strong genes and, as anyone who knows her will attest, will work as hard as is humanly possible to beat the odds. However, her recovery over the months and years ahead will be a marathon - not a sprint - and the out of pocket costs of retrofitting her life while continuing to care for her family will be immense and ongoing.  Upcoming expenses will include a house renovation or relocation, vehicles that accommodate her limitations, ongoing nursing care, as well as supplemental child care and housekeeping services.  Your generosity to Victoria and her family will certainly help ease their burden through this process.  We deeply appreciate anything you can do.   We know Victoria can do this, and we know it will be made easier with all of your support and prayers.The Gouletas and Burk families thank you for your incredible kindness.“Most of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.” ― Louis D.

Medical,1,Help Pay Esther’s Medical Bills,https://www.gofundme.com/helpestherconquercancer,"MECHANICSBURG, PA","May 5, 2018","$200,918","$176,411","￼￼￼￼Help us raise the $200,918 needed to pay the medical bills before Esther left this earth on July 25th, 2018Esther was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 26 in early 2016. Her rare form of cancer puts her in a situation where conventional medicine cannot help her any further.She is pursuing alternate treatment at the Immunity Therapy Center near San Diego where she will start receiving the intensive, targeted treatments her body is needing now more than ever. These treatments will strengthen her immune system as well as help it to recognize the cancerous cells in order to overcome them. She is scheduled to begin on Monday, May 7th, and will be needing the funds by May 27th at the latest.  Her father, Rick Ridings, is overseeing this account, withdrawals, and payments.  On May 8th, we increased the goal to $50,000 as they have now recommended extra treatments and continuing care. This is an urgent need and any amount you are able to contribute to her life is deeply appreciated! Please share this page and spread the word for this. Thank you! For more details, see below.Read more of Esther's story on her blog: https://findingperspective.net/The BackstoryHi, I’m Esther Moore. I’m a mother, musician, a writer and blogger. I’m married to William Moore and we have a gorgeous little four year old boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. ￼￼￼￼About a year and a half after finding out Levy’s surprise diagnosis at birth, I was told at the age of 26 that my body was fighting a very aggressive, fast growing type of cancer  - triple negative breast cancer, one of the hardest to treat conventionally. I had two surgeries, an extensive one where they took out all my lymph nodes in my left arm and another when I found a second lump under my arm a few months later. ￼￼￼￼Then, I found a third lump - the third time the cancer had recurred within 9 months. At this point the doctors told me that they wouldn’t recommend surgery, because it would just keep coming back. They said that unfortunately, since it had shown to be so aggressive and recurring, any treatment they could give me like chemo and radiation would most likely only be palliative (just have a small chance of even extending my life), not curative. It was devastating to hear. After the surgeon told me it was now inoperable and that there was nothing else they could offer me that would be curative, we prayed about it and decided to move back from the UK to the place I had grown up to be near family - Jerusalem, Israel. I’ve been following an intensive natural/alternative treatment plan since the beginning that has helped a huge amount. We also have been blown away by how many people around the world have been praying for us and believing with us for total healing, that we believe has made a huge difference. Thankfully, this seemed to help delay the cancer spreading since the oncologist told me back in October 2016 that it would have spread to all my major organs within the next three months. Up until recently, it miraculously hadn’t spread at all and was still contained to the area under my arm. Where I am nowRecently, I’ve been in a lot more intense constant pain. My left arm has also become swollen, painful and unusable with symptoms of lymphedema (common after the surgery I had). We decided to go to the hospital here to see if anything could be done. After what felt like a million tests, scans and long days at the hospital, we found out the results...and they were not what we were hoping for. It showed that the cancer now had started to spread throughout my lymphatic system, and that they had also found a small mass on one of my vertebrae bones. It was so hard to hear, but we’re thankful that it hasn’t spread further and has not spread to any organs. Still, we knew something had to be done. Although this would now class it as stage four cancer, the doctors at the hospital said there was still hope. They told us there is a new cancer treatment called immunotherapy, a treatment that supercharges the immune system to fight against the cancer itself that has had incredible results - even for people with stage 4 cancer. Our next stepsAfter a lot of prayer and research and talking things through, we decided to look at clinics that specialise in this treatment. We found one near San Diego called the Immunity Therapy Center  that offers immunotherapy along with all of the intensive, non toxic treatments that I have researched and been wanting to do.  There are case studies of people who did these treatments at this Center who had stage 4, triple negative breast cancer  and had incredible results - even going home cancer free. The center combines the latest cutting edge medical treatments with holistic, natural non-toxic therapies to get the best results. From independent reviews  it looks like they have helped thousands of people, many with stage 4 cancer, to massively improve and often become cancer free. Within a couple days of finding the clinic and it being confirmed to us that this seemed to be the next step, everything miraculously fell into place faster than we could have imagined. I’ll be flying out today (!!) to start treatment this Monday, the 7th of May.  We strongly feel that this is my best chance at getting my life back and being here for our son and future children. But, we need your help. All together the costs come to 30,000 US dollars for a three week treatment. Many people in my situation have had incredible results even in these three weeks, but included in this cost is a detailed intensive home treatment plan provided by the clinic for at least three months afterwards as well. We’re so thankful for the incredible support network we’ve had around us from the beginning from all over the world, and appreciate anything you can do to help us meet our goal by donating and/or sharing this page. Thank you for helping me conquer this cancer!",944,3.2k,10,"1,078",4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
