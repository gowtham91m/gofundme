Medical,1,Olivia Stoy:Transplant & Liv it up!,https://www.gofundme.com/olivia-stoy-bone-marrow-transplant,"ASHLEY, IN","May 18, 2018",$1.0M,"$316,651","Update: Many fundraisers have been put into place to raise funds for the Stoy Family to cover the cost of the transplant. Nearly a month into fundraising, Olivia's story had reached so many people that the initial goal was met! $350,000 was the cost of the initial procedure and does not include additional treatment: hospital stays longer than the allotted 50 days, medications, time off of work, and travel expenses. Depending on how fast Olivia's health progresses after the transplant, additional bills could add up fast. Now, Olivia wants to use this experience to bring light to childhood cancer and raise additional money for other children in medical battles of their own. As a result, she created Liv It Up , a campaign designed to shed light on the struggles of childhood cancer through her own personal experiences and those of families she has met along the way. In an effort to help her through the recovery process, Olivia wants to raise $1 million for Liv It Up, to help give young cancer patients a chance at being a kid and their parents the peace of mind that they will have help paying for life-saving medical treatments like Olivia's.Olivia Stoy was an active 12 year old girl, finishing her first year at Angola Middle School. What was thought to be a lingering cold turned out to be something much more serious. Olivia was sent from a local hospital to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis and was eventually diagnosed with T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.  Right away, her team of doctors worked on her treatment plan.  Of course, there were a few bumps in the road: a chemo medication that at normal strength caused Olivia to have seizures; an infection which meant an automatic 2 week stay in the hospital; not to mention all of the trips to and from Riley in between those events.  But after all the ups and downs on February 14, 2017 Olivia was declared cancer free but would need to continue treatments through September 2018 to increase the chances of her cancer not returning.During this time, many people asked how they could help, how could they donate. The Stoy family was not in need of funds at the time and Olivia wanted to make sure other kids could benefit from the work of the Child Life Specialists at Riley and Cancer Research. All money was directed to the Riley Foundation where Olivia chose it’s route. To date, over $50,000 has been donated to Riley in Olivia’s name. In March 2018, just one year after celebrating Olivia being cancer free, Olivia’s cancer returned. It was devastating for all who followed her story. Right away the doctors at Riley worked on a plan for Olivia’s relapse. The plan consisted of several rounds of chemotherapy and once the cancer is gone a bone marrow transplant will be needed. After testing members of Olivia’s immediate family, her brother was found to be a 100% match! The Stoy family is part of a faith sharing insurance plan that does not cover organ transplants, including bone marrow transplants. While the family has appealed to the insurance board, on May 14, 2018 the sharing/insurance plan declined coverage of the bone marrow transplant which is the recommended treatment option by doctors at Riley Hospital for Olivia’s survival.We are fundraising for the Stoy Family to help cover the cost of the bone marrow transplant. The original estimate is $900,000. The family has negotiated a price with the hospital and needs to raise $350,000 before for the bone marrow transplant can take place which is estimated to begin July 2018. Should any complication arise during Olivia’s treatment additional funds will be needed. If funds are raised that exceed the amount needed for the bone marrow transplant, the hope is that this fund can provide to other childhood cancer patients and their families for years to come in honor of Olivia Stoy, a true fighter and inspiration to so many!Tax deductible checks can be made out to “Liv it Up” and mailed to Pleasant Lake Mennonite Church | c/o Liv It Up | 5142 S.

Medical,1,Claire Wineland Needs Our Help,https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire,"GARDEN GROVE, CA","June 12, 2018","$225,000","$264,710","First of all, WOW!! We have been blown away by the amazing outpouring of love and support you have shown to Claire..deeply humbled in fact.  Friends have encouraged us to raise the goal to meet the demand but I want everyone to know that our transplant finances have been covered in full.  Anything additional you choose to donate will be to show Claire your love and to help her do something amazing post transplant.  She is full of wonderful ideas but first new lungs, then look out world! :) <3 ""Death is inevitable, but living a life we are proud of is something we can control"". ~ Claire Wineland Some of you may have heard one of Claire Wineland's  many inspirational speeches at events such as PTTOW, THRIVE: Make Money Matter, WORLDZ, Zappos, Klick Health, TEDx, OMED and AARC or possibly you follow her on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram   or YouTube  but one thing about her is she never asks for help for herself, she is a stubborn little force of nature and determined to  live her life to the fullest despite her failing health and is always, always of service to others and shares her message far and wide. This last year, her decline due to having Cystic Fibrosis  (CF) has been drastic.  She is unable to do the work that she loves, which is traveling the world to share her message with thousands of people, she is using a wheelchair due to shortness of breath to walk more than 100ft and her quality of life has become just about staying alive. ￼ This is not the Claire we all know and love. ￼  She has recently been placed on the UCSD Lung Transplant list and is anxiously awaiting the call for new lungs.  A new start, a new chapter #metamorphosis.  Again, we want to make sure that everyone knows this money will not be used for the transplant itself, we do have medical insurance. But the ancillary costs  and medication co pays before, during and after can be considerable, and as you know, she is already struggling to make ends meet and is unable to work. Full recovery can take approximately 6 months post transplant, barring any complications or rejection.We will keep you posted as to her progress! Right now, the doctors say she needs to gain some weight in order to bring down additional risk factors. Did you know that CFers need 5,000 calories a day just to maintain their weight? This is why we started this Go Fund Me page ~ to give her the support she needs up to and beyond transplant for at least 6  months.   Since the transplant will take place in San Diego and she currently lives in Los Angeles, she needs to rent an apartment for 3 to 6 months post transplant as well as pay her rent and living expenses until the big day comes since she is no longer able to work to support herself.  We are thrilled that lungs are on the way but she needs a community to help cover all of the endless expenses involved.  The back and forth to San Diego appointments, the hotels, her current living expenses etc.. We hope that she has inspired you with her endless positivity, sense of humor and charitable work through a non profit she founded at 13 years old, Claire's Place Foundation which ironically helps other CF children and families in the way that she herself needs now.  If you don't know Claire, please take a minute to Google  her name and see some of her videos on line and on social media as well as a beautiful episode on The CWs ""My Last Days, Season 1 "" Directed by Justin Baldoni  and Wayfarer Entertainment. ￼ CNN  has done 2 stories covering her journey for 2 years now and will continue to cover her experience pre and post lung transplant to spread awareness about the process and what people with Cystic Fibrosis go through. Even as her lungs fail, she is still willing to share her experience in the hope of helping another young adult with CF who may be considering a lung transplant. Claire was recently named Glamour Magazine's College Woman of the Year Grand Prize Winner 2018   for her work in advocacy and charity.  Behind the scenes, she struggles for breath and is currently in end stage lung disease, but that is not the face she shows the world. ￼ Please, consider making a donation today so that we can relieve the stress she is feeling about not being well enough to continue working until transplant and possibly up to a year post transplant. What would be most helpful is if  you could make a 10 - 30 second video about how you have been inspired by Claire and then share that video along with this link to your community and social media following.  I am sure with your help, we can reach and maybe even beat this goal.   https://www.gofundme.com/teamclaire with hashtag #TeamClaire Thank you so much for your support!  Please do share with followers, friends and family that you feel might be inspired to support as well. Your donations will be deposited in to a private account for Claire and used to pay her rent and expenses over the next 6 to 18 months so she can simply focus on this next huge step while she is so ill.  Specifically travel money, hotels, medications, apartment rental pre transplant here in Los Angeles and post transplant in San Diego, food and other necessities for Claire.Warmly, #TeamClaire ""Truly honored to have lived, failed and accomplished in the ways I have"" ~ Claire WIneland ￼

She is a self less soul who always places the happiness of others above hers.When she got pregnant the 2nd time, we were excited as friends to see the baby boy. She got herself checked in for delivery at Stanford medical facility - Dublin the night of 16th May 2018. Its been 65 days but Ganga hasn’t returned home. Ganga went through 2 cardiac arrests, brain damage and has been in coma and a partial vegetative state past 65 days. Ganga was diagnosed with AFE (amniotic fluid embolism). A rare childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid, enters the blood stream of the mother to trigger a serious reaction. When she was awaiting delivery the night of, the amniotic fluid percolated into her system putting her heart through 2 cardiac arrests. The CPR brought her back temporarily but the fluid mixed blood had affected the brain pushing her into coma.Her husband Sriram, our dear friend has not left her side since that day. It kills him to watch the enigma of his life, lying unresponsive to the very voices that filled her life. Her little child still thinks her mom is just unwell and will come back and hug her soon, the baby boy Rithvin has not felt the touch of his dear mother till this day.At this heart wrenching moment, we would like your help to keep Ganga in the facility, so she receives the much needed treatment to recover. The family has undergone unimaginable trauma in a matter of hours and its been 65 days of suffering.Our hopes are high, she is taking baby steps of progress now, she opens her eyes, but can’t process her surrounding yet. She can hear you speak but cannot respond yet. But we are happy she has progressed thus far. We seek your help to continue the treatment and hospital care such that our Ganga returns back to us the way she was in fullness and health. Her little children have suffered enough and should be able to re-unite with their mother soon.

She had lower abdominal pain all summer long, and just before going back to finish her final year at Covenant College in Georgia, she went for a check up at her gynocologist to check for orvarian cysts. During a laproscopic procedure the cancer was discovered. After meeting several oncologists, Hanna felt strongly that she needed to pursue a natural approach to dealing with the disease. She was able to enter into the care of some of the best alternative doctors available who felt confident they could help her. And so, over the past 6 months Hanna has pursued every avenue of homeopathic treatments, traveling to doctors around the tri-state area every day of the week, sometimes two in one day. We found out two weeks ago that the the tumors in Hanna's abdomen have grown from 3 CM to 17.5 CM - and have englufed her bladder, uterus, ovaries and affected part of her liver. It was made clear to her and my family that surgery is required immediately.WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:Hanna met with THE top surgeon for this type of cancer in Washington D.C. and he has an opening available to perform surgery this Thursday, March 8, 2018, before he takes a leave of absence. But, our insurance will only cover procedures within the state of New Jersey. We need to raise the funds to get this procedure done this week. We have no time to waste chasing down the insurance company. All donations will be put into the bank account of Hanna's mom - Hope, as she is sparing Hanna the financial burden as Hanna fights for her life. Throughout this entire experience, Hanna has remained steadfast and hopeful, which we credit to God and the immensely supportive community of friends and family who have come alongside her, prayed for her and sent notes of encouragement to Hanna. We recognize this is an incredible amount of money to try and raise in such a short amount of time, but her life depends on it. We believe that God is bigger than cancer, and that everything is possible through Him. So, we are hoping and believing for the impossible - and would be so grateful for anything you can do to help financially and by sharing this page.",2.7k,3.7k,14,"2,705",6 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATES|| 8/06/2018 - 1930 MST|| Jake is enjoying his recovery in Dhahran and slowly getting back to normal: spending time at the student center and getting back into a daily routine. Last weekend was a weekend of firsts. First time driving, first time in the water, and first time throwing a frisbee! || 7/17/2018 - 0149 GMT+2 || Jake had a great time watching the World Cup Final with his students at the Student Center yesterday evening. Jake continues to be active in working towards his recovery. He has been doing PT at home with his Mom and brother Caleb coaching him everyday. There have been ongoing medical appointments and things are moving in a good direction. Again, thanks for everything, ALL of the support has been nothing short of amazing!|| 7/12/2018 - 1638 MDT || Jake is continuing his recovery back in Dhahran. The main goal currently is to reduce the swelling in the residual limb and he has already seen some progress. He has been awarded a new and more suitable house form Aramco, which he appreciates very much! The move is still in progress, but a big shout out to all the people who have already lended a hand! 


The food train has been an absolute blessing and he is eating quite well! The best news of all is that his Mom (Robbin) and Caleb (his brother) have arrived to Saudi!|| 7/7/2018 - 2200 MDT || Jake is starting to feel more at home again in his community. He's very happy to be back and has enjoyed catching up with a few people and slowly getting back into a more normal routine. Aramco is in the process of finding him a more suitable living arrangement as well, something that is a single-floor. Yes, he also went back today to teach his first fitness class! Here are a few pics from him driving with a colleague to look for a new place as well as him with his fitness class. || 7/4/2018 - 1800 MDT || Jake is SUPER happy to be back in Dhahran in his community! However, the heat is NO JOKE over there and forgetting your sunglasses doesn't make it any easier on a 110+ degree day! (Pic below) He's very happy to be back in an environment where he is familiar with the medical staff that is treating him. He is also very thankful for the meal train that has been initiated for him (link:  https://www.mealtrain.com/trains/zv21gd ). More to come later and he's still not quite ready for visitors, but thinks that next week may be the week.|| 7/3/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jake has safely made it back to his community in Dhahran! It's amazing that he was able to move himself so early. He told me that it was pretty wild to think that he was undergoing surgery for the amputation of his leg less than 5 days ago, and he was now using crutches to move across the tarmac and board a plane! It took a tremendous amount of energy for him, so he is still resting quite a bit, but Jake is excited to start seeing everyone soon! Now that he is back in his home community, they have organized meals for him which he is beyond excited about! Pics to come later! || 7/2/2018 - 1400 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake earlier today and he is ON THE MOVE! He departed the hospital in Jeddah earlier today and is on the plane on the way back to Dhahran! He is SUPER excited to be back in the community and to continue this road to recovery. He asked me to share a few pictures of him on the move today. More to come soon with his updates, and I don't know when he'll be ready to start seeing visitors, but I know everyone is anxious to see him. I'll be sure to let everyone know as soon as he feels up to it. BTW - can you believe how good he already is on crutches?!?!BTW - Yes, I realize that some of the photos are sideways :) I'll eventually figure out how to get them straightened out without cropping out half of the photo! || 7/1/2018 - 1600 MDT || I (Caleb) spoke with Jake a few times today and he has a lot of positive news he would like to share! He has a few pictures to share as well. The first picture is of Jake cleaning himself up a bit, getting his hair washed and just sitting up for a while! The second is of him learning to balance himself on crutches and moving around, a LOT! The third is of him receiving his latest blood transfusion. Which, we have also received the results from, and his levels are stable enough now for a short term air travel back to the hospital in Dhahran (where he lives and his community is). He is hoping to get fly there tomorrow pending any other complications! As always, he is in great spirits despite the circumstances, and is SUPER thankful for the support. Again, huge shout out to Sarah who has not left his side and has been a tremendous advocate for Jake the last few days. Not to mention all the of support that Aramco and all of his friends/family are helping with behind the scenes .|| 7/1/2018 - 0400 MDT || ""You got to Move it Move it"" is the theme of Jake's day today! He called me (Caleb) this morning to inform me that he was moving under his own power with crutches. He was able to get out of the bed and do a little bathing (which we know both Jake and Sarah were grateful for). His energy levels are much higher today than yesterday. His body has accepted both blood transfusions that they gave him over the last 30 hours, which takes a lot of time and requires very frequent monitoring making it tough for Jake to rest. He is moving more towards stability Pics to come soon! || 6/30/2018 - 1000 MDT || Jeremy (Jakes brother) spoke with Jake this morning. We are all really impressed that he is up and moving! He was able to get out of his bed yesterday and got to start working on his balance. Jake said, ""It's a little weird, my body has a new center of gravity now"". It was a LOT of effort for him to be up and moving yesterday. Today, he has been taking a little rest from all that work, and has his focus set clearly on catching up on all the World Cup games that he's been missing! Here's a photo of Jake's current status. || 6/29/2018 - 1100 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake this morning and he is up and moving! He has been making great progress, which none of use every doubted that he would for a second. They were able to take the catheter out this morning (which Jake is thankful for) and he is starting to move around. His spirit is unbreakable and unbelievably positive. Also, he wanted to share a few photos for everyone. He also wanted to let people know he stood up under his OWN POWER using the bars that they installed. Sarah has been a rockstar as well and there with Jake supporting him and pushing him right along into the recovery! He's super thankful for everything and is doing his best to respond to messages as he has the time and energy.

|| 6/28/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb spoke with Jake today and he is in great spirits! He managed to get some good laughs in with Jake and talked about how he is doing. Jake said that the highlight of his day was a giant bag of cherries which he devoured! He is getting his appetite back and is becoming more stable every day. He is still not in a good position to accept visitors, but we all know that with his big personality, it won't be long! All of your support is appreciated and I'm certain that all of us together are making a big difference.|| 6/28/2018 - 0800 MDT || The family spoke with Jake this morning. He is overwhelmed by all of the support and expressed his thanks for all of it. He know's its tough, but he asked for NO VISITORS at the current time. He is still very focused on the recovery and will advise the family when he is able to accept visitors. Thank you again for all of your support and understanding. || 6/27/2018 - 2300 MDT || Caleb (Jake's brother) spoke with Jake tonight. He's in great spirits and appreciates the overwhelming love and support from everyone. He is stable at the hospital in East Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He's been getting good rest and has someone with him 24/7. Please try not to overwhelm him as he's resting. The family will be providing accurate updates on this page.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The family is managing the online side of this GoFundMe page.

The current prognosis is that she will never walk again.Victoria retains complete mental capacity as well as the use of her head, neck and arms.

Her rare form of cancer puts her in a situation where conventional medicine cannot help her any further.She is pursuing alternate treatment at the Immunity Therapy Center near San Diego where she will start receiving the intensive, targeted treatments her body is needing now more than ever. These treatments will strengthen her immune system as well as help it to recognize the cancerous cells in order to overcome them. She is scheduled to begin on Monday, May 7th, and will be needing the funds by May 27th at the latest.  Her father, Rick Ridings, is overseeing this account, withdrawals, and payments.  On May 8th, we increased the goal to $50,000 as they have now recommended extra treatments and continuing care. This is an urgent need and any amount you are able to contribute to her life is deeply appreciated! Please share this page and spread the word for this. Thank you! For more details, see below.Read more of Esther's story on her blog: https://findingperspective.net/The BackstoryHi, I’m Esther Moore. I’m a mother, musician, a writer and blogger. I’m married to William Moore and we have a gorgeous little four year old boy who happens to have Down Syndrome. ￼￼￼￼About a year and a half after finding out Levy’s surprise diagnosis at birth, I was told at the age of 26 that my body was fighting a very aggressive, fast growing type of cancer  - triple negative breast cancer, one of the hardest to treat conventionally. I had two surgeries, an extensive one where they took out all my lymph nodes in my left arm and another when I found a second lump under my arm a few months later. ￼￼￼￼Then, I found a third lump - the third time the cancer had recurred within 9 months. At this point the doctors told me that they wouldn’t recommend surgery, because it would just keep coming back. They said that unfortunately, since it had shown to be so aggressive and recurring, any treatment they could give me like chemo and radiation would most likely only be palliative (just have a small chance of even extending my life), not curative. It was devastating to hear. After the surgeon told me it was now inoperable and that there was nothing else they could offer me that would be curative, we prayed about it and decided to move back from the UK to the place I had grown up to be near family - Jerusalem, Israel. I’ve been following an intensive natural/alternative treatment plan since the beginning that has helped a huge amount. We also have been blown away by how many people around the world have been praying for us and believing with us for total healing, that we believe has made a huge difference. Thankfully, this seemed to help delay the cancer spreading since the oncologist told me back in October 2016 that it would have spread to all my major organs within the next three months. Up until recently, it miraculously hadn’t spread at all and was still contained to the area under my arm. Where I am nowRecently, I’ve been in a lot more intense constant pain. My left arm has also become swollen, painful and unusable with symptoms of lymphedema (common after the surgery I had). We decided to go to the hospital here to see if anything could be done. After what felt like a million tests, scans and long days at the hospital, we found out the results...and they were not what we were hoping for. It showed that the cancer now had started to spread throughout my lymphatic system, and that they had also found a small mass on one of my vertebrae bones. It was so hard to hear, but we’re thankful that it hasn’t spread further and has not spread to any organs. Still, we knew something had to be done. Although this would now class it as stage four cancer, the doctors at the hospital said there was still hope. They told us there is a new cancer treatment called immunotherapy, a treatment that supercharges the immune system to fight against the cancer itself that has had incredible results - even for people with stage 4 cancer. Our next stepsAfter a lot of prayer and research and talking things through, we decided to look at clinics that specialise in this treatment. We found one near San Diego called the Immunity Therapy Center  that offers immunotherapy along with all of the intensive, non toxic treatments that I have researched and been wanting to do.  There are case studies of people who did these treatments at this Center who had stage 4, triple negative breast cancer  and had incredible results - even going home cancer free. The center combines the latest cutting edge medical treatments with holistic, natural non-toxic therapies to get the best results. From independent reviews  it looks like they have helped thousands of people, many with stage 4 cancer, to massively improve and often become cancer free. Within a couple days of finding the clinic and it being confirmed to us that this seemed to be the next step, everything miraculously fell into place faster than we could have imagined. I’ll be flying out today (!!) to start treatment this Monday, the 7th of May.  We strongly feel that this is my best chance at getting my life back and being here for our son and future children. But, we need your help. All together the costs come to 30,000 US dollars for a three week treatment. Many people in my situation have had incredible results even in these three weeks, but included in this cost is a detailed intensive home treatment plan provided by the clinic for at least three months afterwards as well. We’re so thankful for the incredible support network we’ve had around us from the beginning from all over the world, and appreciate anything you can do to help us meet our goal by donating and/or sharing this page.

With dedication and hard work, while training in Antigua, Greg landed a full-time, professional crew position on a sailing yacht. Greg’s dream became a reality and he was excited to begin his worldwide adventure traveling and working on the vessel.While anchored off the island of Grenada, Greg was enjoying a relaxing day with his crew at the waterfalls when the accident happened. Severe damage was done to his spine along with fractures of his right foot and ankle. Thanks to a very gifted Cuban trained Neuro surgeon, (Dr. Nillo Alveraz, age 28), Greg's fractured back was fortunately stabilized enough to be quickly airlifted back to the United States. Upon arrival in Florida, Greg's back was permanently repaired and stabilized. Then, efforts turned to multiple surgical attempts to repair the compound fractures and soft tissue damage to his right foot and ankle. However, to give Greg the best hope to ultimately enjoy a pain free and active life, it was necessary to amputate Greg’s right foot below the knee. Greg’s dream came to a halt and his future life became altered. But, with Greg’s character there is absolutely no doubt hope and courage will prevail. He has always stepped up to any challenge placed in his path.Greg is now on his new road to recovery assisted with the loving support of his doctors, family and friends.  Insurance will cover many of his medical costs but not all. Most importantly, he will require access to the best available services and prostheses for him to live his life to its full potential.  I'm certain all those who have known, loved and admire Greg will want this for him too. The cost of prosthetics will be significant and an ongoing financial burden. So please, let us all consider “stepping up” for Greg. Please do donate to Greg's recovery as he deserves the best doctors, therapy services, and most importantly, prostheses out there to achieve a full recovery and regain his healthy, active lifestyle once again.No donation is too small. Let’s work together to make sure Greg is given the means to ensure full recovery.  Our contributions are perhaps “one small step” for us and “one giant leap” forward for Greg. We love you Greg-you got this!*For those wondering, Greg's father, Ed Strauss is listed as the main beneficiary of this campaign. This means all your donations will go directly to Greg through his parents. We thank you all for your love, support, and donations!",1.1k,2.4k,12,"1,157",4 months,3 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

We felt we needed to start something to help alleviate any financial stress so the Duncan family and James’s partner, Colleen Maxwell can focus on treatment and healing. Colleen has been part of James's life since high school, and will continue to be by his side and care for James and his children. The money donated will be used to pay for medical expenses not covered by insurance and to help with daily living expenses. James has a long road ahead of him, but we know James has the strength, determination, and faith to recover to his fullest extent. Please keep James in your thoughts and prayers and thank you for your support. Your thoughts, prayers, generous donations and resources to help him heal are sincerely appreciated. ￼",785,1.6k,3,767,3 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

When they discovered that wasn’t possible, both were undeterred. The Rogers felt there was room in their home and hearts for adopted children. Their first, a newborn daughter, was adopted from a broken home in 1989. The second, a 12 year-old Russian boy adopted in2005.The Rogers entered Jaiden’s life not a moment too soon. After his birth mom signed over guardianship, Tim and Natalie were finally directed to remote residence in Georgia. When they walked in ‘the smell was overwhelming.’ They found a little boy with fetal alcohol syndrome, neglected and malnourished, huddled next to his filthy car seat. He was even once observed eating dog food out of a dog dish because he hadn’t been fed.For the first year they had Jaiden, he used to sneak into the Roger’s bedroom in the middle of the night and feel their faces to make sure they were still there, then go back to bed. What neither Jaiden nor his new family could have known then was the only thing more horrifying than the first chapter of Jaiden’s life would be the second chapter.The trouble began innocently enough 6 years ago when Tim noticed a small lump on Jaiden’s right thigh just underneath his skin. He took Jaiden to a dermatologist who told them to keep an eye on it. The lump started getting bigger. Even more startling, the lump had started to spread…. fast.“It was as if the skin on his right leg was an 1/8 of an inch thick with something very hard underneath, like stone. It felt like tapping on a countertop.”In a matter of weeks, the growth had wrapped around Jaiden’s right thigh and behind his knee. Once the hard calcifications invaded the joint, Jaiden began to lose mobility. The family rushed to Texas Tech Medical Center for a biopsy.When the results came back, even the doctors couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Jaiden was diagnosed with something called Stiff Skin Syndrome. Jaiden is the 41st documented case ever in the world, and the only one in the world righ now, as far as we know.Stiff Skin Syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by hard, thick skin, which can spread over the entire body, causing immobility. Muscles become weak, and the pain is unbearable!Jaiden’s doctors acknowledged that, they’d never seen such aggressive spread of the syndrome. In a month, it spread to Jaiden’s left leg, both hips, buttocks, and his arms. Spots have recently appeared near his spine. The once-hyperactive Jaiden is often confined to a wheelchair and no longer able to attend school with his friends.  Every day the pain from the disorder grows worse. Jaiden is the first to point out new, hard spots of skin. Jaiden understands that he is sick as much as a 12 year old boy can, although he cannot fully grasp the intent of the sinister syndrome branching out just beneath his skin.JAIDEN IS SLOWLY TURNING TO STONE!Over the last few years, the fight back has begun. Jaiden’s treatment started with rounds of chemotherapy to try to halt the spread of the calcifications. The chemo destroys both good and bad cells, leaving Jaiden weak and open to infection. He wears a medical mask to prevent infections or viruses he would not be able to fend off due to his weakened immune system.Jaiden has also started physical therapy. This is the most crucial component of his treatment. His muscles must be stretched to keep his joints limber. The stretching is immensely painful. Still, Jaiden smiles and jokes with his doctors. Jaiden submits to therapy 3 times/week. Ideally, he should be in therapy 6 times per week but the co-pays are too costly for the Rogers family.Because there are so few recorded cases, nobody knows what the worst case scenario is here. As aggressive as Jaiden’s calcifications are spreading it’s likely the disorder will spread until Jaiden experiences total paralysis. Jaiden will become entombed inside himself.  Jaiden takes 10 medications a day including a chemo medication and 4 different heavy duty pain medications.WE CAN NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN!Jaiden’s stiff skin has now started to restrict his lungs and he now requires oxygen and a resperator to help him breathe .  As his chemo continues to help slow the progression of his stiff skin, it is starting to spread at a faster rate.  We have exhausted all help in the United States, costing  the Rogers over $500,000 of there own retirement money and they have also mortgaged their house. We are now left with one last hope for Jaiden , AND WE NEED YOUR HELP. We absolutely need to get him to Europe to try a special stem cell treatment specifically for rare skin diseases.  Without this treatment Jaiden’s Skin will continue to harden and and he will start to deteriorate.  We are unsure about what will start happening to his other organs.  THE COST OF THIS TREATMENT AND THE COST TO STAY INEUROPE FOR A YEAR WILL COST ROUGHLY $1.5 million.  The Rogers are asking people to donate what they can.  WE CAN NOT DO THIS WITHOUT ALL OF YOUR HELP!!  IIF WE CANT RAISE THE MONEY TO SAVE JAIDEN , WE ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING TO DO FOR HIM..  We are also asking if you have hotel points or flyer points that you are willing to donate, please let them know.Jaiden is a survivor. The first two years of his life he endured hardships no child should suffer. The lasting effects of which are imprinted so deeply he would sneak into his new family’s bedroom just to make sure somebody was there. Today, we’re all there for Jaiden.Jaiden has been seen on the daytime tv The Doctors, Goog morning America, channel 5 news out of Colorado Springs, channels 4,9 and Fox News out of Denver and also newspapers all over the world trying to find a cure.The Rogers are currently working with Dr. Elizabeth Swanson with Childrens Hospital and Dr. Hal Dietz at John Hopkins University, Baltimore. https://people.com/human-interest/12-year-old-boy-disease-stone-entombed-within-himself/",2.4k,2.6k,17,"2,435",4 months,1 month ago,4 months,2018-09-03
Medical,3,Save Kenneth Young,https://www.gofundme.com/savekennethyoung,"HILLSDALE, NY","March 10, 2018","$95,000","$134,775","Nightmare in PanamaMy Father, Kenneth Young, is fighting for his life in Panama. Dad has bacterial meningitis and a collapsed lung, and is under intensive care at Clínica Hospital San Fernando, Panama City.Although Dad has medical insurance back home, it doesn’t cover out of country treatment and we have been relying on his travelers insurance, which just ran out. The hospital is demanding payment up-front before further treatment.We desperately need your help to keep him alive long enough to recover to the point where he can be transported back home.Keep Kenneth AliveBecause he is a foreigner, the hospital requires money up front, and they require a large amount. Initially they required a $20,000 deposit and we were able to scramble for the cash as well as raise our credit limit an additional $15,000. However, intensive care is incredibly expensive. Some examples: to remain in intensive care costs $800 a day. To “adjust the respirator” costs $50 each time which is done many times a day. The doctors charge thousands every day and procedures such as X-rays and CT scans are also expensive. We are tapped out financially and need your help. Please give whatever you can so that my sister Esther can have her father at her graduation this spring. So that my little brother Evan, who has down syndrome and only knows that his dad is sick, and all his friends and family can see him again.My Dad's StoryMy dad Kenneth and mom Irene had been planning this trip for years. My mom has severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we thought that the combination of warm weather, affordable living and family friends would make Panama an ideal place to retire to. One of my dad’s best friends is originally from Panama, and my parents have been planning a scouting vacation to see if Panama would work. For as long as I remember, my dad has worked incredibly hard for my family, when my mother developed her condition my father somehow managed to balance between working even harder and being the best husband and father my entire family could ever have hoped for. The hideous irony here, is that what was supposed to have been a well deserved trip to prepare for a sustainable retirement has turned into a nightmare for our whole family that is devouring the very retirement funds that my parents were trying to save.Shortly before the trip, both my parents came down with the flu, despite making sure they got vaccinated. They were both feeling better in time for the flight but (according to the doctors) my father likely developed a secondary ear infection he was not aware of. As the plane descended for the landing Kenneth’s eardrum burst. Shortly after, Dad began complaining of pain, developed a fever and became disoriented. He was brought to a local clinic where they administered antibiotics, but this was not enough. He was brought to a hospital where they informed my mother that the infection had moved from his ear to inside his skull and that he had meningitis. Since then it has been a constant battle. Doctors put him in an induced coma and performed surgery to physically remove as much of the infection as possible. Although the antibiotics seemed to be mostly working, the seriousness of his infection meant it would not be an easy recovery under the best of circumstances. Unfortunately, there have been additional complications as one of his lungs has partially collapsed. This all means that, although his travel insurance will pay for emergency medical air transport, he is in too serious a condition to transport at this time. I have dropped everything to fly down to Panama with my sister Esther so I can help my mother and be with my father. My mother and I are currently staying in a cheap airbnb near the hospital. The cost of living in Panama City is surprisingly, not that much cheaper than back home, but we doing everything we can to be as extremely economical as possible. 
A message from my mom, Irene.""We are so fortunate to have close family and friends who are helping out with our son, Evan, at home. Evan has Down Syndrome and requires help with day-to-day living. Our daughter, Esther, graduates college on May 7th. It would be a wonderful miracle if she could have her father there with her. It would be the best graduation present ever. Out eldest son, Luke, will stay down here for a couple of weeks to help support me. Esther returns home to finish out her semester. I am so grateful for all the loving support we have received so far. The emotions on that end are overwhelming and fill my heart with love. Please consider donating whatever you can to help keep Kenneth alive and for me to stay here with him. I want Kenneth to come home also for Evan, who only knows that his father is sick. Evan is desperate to see Kenneth again. Please share our story with your Facebook friends, too. Thank you for taking the time to read about what has happened to Kenneth. Obviously this turn of events will have a profound effect on Kenneth’s future, the future of our family, and the greater community as well. We wish you well, and are grateful beyond words for the outpouring of sympathy and concern we have already received.""",612,1.6k,75,608,5 months,4 months ago,5 months,2018-09-03

They have brought some semblance of comfort to our family during an impossibly difficult time. We are especially grateful for the funds being raised for Cory and Maran’s boys: Brycen, Benton, and Braedan. Our hearts ache knowing that Maran’s sons will grow up without their incredible Mom. As many of you know, shortly after bringing Braedan into this world, Maran suffered a catastrophic bleed in her brain from a suspected AVM. Despite her medical team’s best efforts and timely care, we eventually learned that her injury was so significant that there was no chance of recovery. Maran’s wish was to have her organs donated, should a terrible situation like this ever come to be. We have honoured this wish, and know that in passing, Maran has continued to do what she did best – take care of others. There is still much work to be done to support her husband and three sons, including a newborn baby. Your contributions to this campaign have helped us to feel that Maran’s beautiful young family will be well cared-for, despite her untimely death. Maran was, simply put, a wonderful person. This page is a testament to the many lives she has touched in both her work and personal life. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support.

Medical,3,Jeremiah's Battle For His Life,https://www.gofundme.com/ccu35y-help-with-financial-burdens,"METAIRIE, LA","April 4, 2018","$250,000","$132,750","Jeremiah’s Battle for His Life“Definitely the underdog here,” was how Jeremiah’s oncologist described his cancer. “Got to fight harder.” Preliminary pathology suggests that Jeremiah’s cancer is Osteoblastic Osteosarcoma, a bone cancer resistant to radiation.Jeremiah (16) is used to being the underdog. He suffered the loss of his mother to cancer when a little boy. His father is in fulltime ministry to abolish abortion, so financial struggles were a normal part of growing up. He’s from a large homeschooling family of thirteen brothers and sisters. The youngest of five brothers who all played football, Jeremiah learned to fight. Years of losing on the football field trained him to fight hard. His hard work paid off. He is an all-star, state champion. But it was his love for Jesus and the family ministry to abolish abortion that taught him to fight harder. Now he’s in the battle for his life. In July 2017, Jeremiah rededicated his life to Christ and was baptized at an Operation Save America ministry event in Louisville, Kentucky. In March 2018 he was diagnosed with cancer. The MRI revealed two tumors on Jeremiah’s spine, between zones T6 and T7. Picture a pair of hands pressing together, crushing his nerve endings. These tumors are in addition to the one in his chest. Without surgery, the tumors will cause Jeremiah to be permanently paralyzed from the waist down. With surgery, there is a still risk of paralysis because of the location of the tumors. He can also lose the ability to go to the bathroom normally. Finally, following a successful surgery there is no guarantee that Jeremiah will regain the mobility he’s lost. According to the neurosurgeon this type of surgery has a range of outcomes. Some patients regain the former use of their legs. Others do not. The goal of the surgery is to stop further paralysis.Following the surgery, Jeremiah will then face the monster of cancer. He has a tumor in his chest and two spots on his lungs. Jeremiah is in severe pain, without proper medication. His pain radiates down his back and around his side, so he cannot lie on his back or turn to the side. With the tumor in his chest, he cannot lie on his stomach. Often the only relief he finds is standing- but with the tumors in his back causing paralysis that is no longer possible.But as Jeremiah’s father, Rusty explained to the oncologist, “With God all things are possible.” Jeremiah’s bone cancer is aggressive. Whereas the tumor is his chest was a barely noticeable under his skin, it is now the size of an lemon that can be cupped in a hand. Its growth seems to have happened almost overnight; Jeremiah’s pain is growing too, radiating throughout his body. Jeremiah is a brave young man. There is no anger, self-pity or a woes is me attitude . He is more concerned about how others are feeling. When he sees his mother’s concern, he forces a smile or winks. When he sees a worried friend, he stops what he’s doing to pray for them. He posts daily Scripture verse to encourage those who are praying for him and who are following his story on social media. Jeremiah posted this prayer on Facebook:I don’t deserve Your healing but Lord You will always deserve my praise. Through death or life, may Your great name be lifted up and everything that is of me fall to the waste side. Oh Lord, strengthen me that I may fight the battle with a courage Satan cannot tamper with. If You take me home or leave me here to fight a little longer, may it be Your breath in my lungs and Your song on my tongue. Lord I consecrate myself to the full advancement of the Kingdom of God! Lord, I love You and I can’t wait to see You face to face. Amen.As you can imagine, fighting this battle is taking resources the family doesn’t have. Your love, prayers, and support are greatly appreciated.Matthew 19:26 reads, ""Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible'.”The Thomas nation’s stand is simply, they are entrusting the life of their son to the Lord. They believe for a miracle. But even if, that does not take place, they want everyone to know, their faith in Jesus Christ is not for sale and non-negotiable.

Upon being rushed to the hospital via ambulance to Lascolinas Medical city and then they asked to join in Plano Medical city, they discovered tumor in her brain. After doing an initial CT scan and finding a massive mask, apart from her fluctuating levels of sugar, sodium and potassium; they performed an MRI and found a tumor between her brain and skull and in between the optic nerves, which was removed after 2 surgeries, one performed through nose and other through open brain surgery and there is still considerable amount of tumor.While we are praying for the best possible scenario to be that the doctors can remove all the tumor, there is a chance that if it is unable to be completely removed because of the location, my mom will need to undergo radiation.My brother also had to drop his course, as my mom needs good care and support (and his course fee is due still of around 8000$).It's already been around 90 days of her suffering in hospital while she is being treated for her brain tumor and mask, suddenly she got to suffer from Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), as she got infected from E. coli bacteria due to high dosage of antibiotics which is a serious addressable condition which leads to sudden drop of blood platelets and slowly effects the other body parts. It's a very rare case and the doctors suggested that the only way to increase her blood platelets is to give her the course of HUS medicine for a year-long from now which is 1 sitting per month which costs around 25,000$/sitting, and “not at all being covered by insurance”.

This beautiful little soul was born on April 24 to her absolutely amazing parents Harry (Hürrem)  and Parla.Ergan Family , We love them! They are the kindest people you will meet.Sienna was born with an extremely rare case of Extreme Congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Only 20 cases have been seen around the world with this severity. On top of that she also has another heart condition called AV Heart Block causing fast and chaotic heartbeats. These rapid heartbeats might trigger a sudden fainting spell or seizure, and in some cases it can beat erratically for so long that it can cause sudden death.Only three hours after she was born, she was transferred to the NICU where she decompensated quickly with suspension of breathing (apnea) and bradycardia.  She was emergency intubated and CPR was initiated. Within hours, she had gone through her first heart surgery and received a pacemaker. She has been sedated and paralyzed since Day 1. She is still at Pediatric Cardio-Thoracic ICU showing the world how strong she is. During this last month, unfortunately her heart stopped pumping two more times (cardiac arrests) but Sienna has the strongest will to live and with your prayers and support still continues her fight.Since her condition is so rare, doctors do not have a lot of prior cases by which to understand the exact course of action and therefore have to take things day by day. They continue to monitor, treat, and work tirelessly in the hopes that she can survive and grow to a point where her heart is more stable. If you are a parent, or even if you are not, you can try to imagine the dark times that her loving parents who just gave her life are going through.  Sienna is hospitalized at UCLA, and her strong and amazing young parents are not leaving her bedside. No one is really thinking about the financial sacrifice, the medical bills which will reach millions of dollars in desperately trying to save this little angel's life. All the energy is focused on keeping her stable so she can join us all here on earth. There is no price for that. Both parents have left everything aside and therefore are not earning any income during this critical time. Money alone is not what will save Sienna but it will sure help the family and reduce some of the obvious stress they are facing.As a parent myself, trying to keep calm just watching my kid scrape his knee while playing, I can not even imagine the strength her parents need to manage while going through this horrible time.Please, Please, Please help with whatever you can give here. Remember, its just money, it means Absolutely Nothing when it comes to life.  Sienna's middle name, Alexa, means strong defender. Let's help her wake up and smile. She will appreciate every single one of you for helping her survive, and she deserves to.They have identified the top pediatric cardiologists in the world who have done so much for her already, who can broaden her treatment with Advanced Genetic Studies and save her life but we need your help. Just as a quick final note, when I started this campaign the Ergan family did not know I started this campaign for them. It could be embarrassing to ask for help and I did not discuss this with them prior as I knew they would say no, but I can assure you that they can use all the help they can get, and this is a chance for each and every one of you to make a positive impact on their lives and help Sienna go through this.THANK YOU AND PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD!Shai Ash￼",931,7.4k,10,997,3 months,12 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

She had a persistent cough and began feeling weak and tired after any physical exertion.

She finally went to the doctor’s office where they performed a chest x-ray that showed fluid on her lungs, leading them to believe she had pneumonia. That news finally convinced her to stay home sick from work. Over the next two days her condition grew dramatically worse. The Doctor finally ordered her in for a CT scan which lead to an echocardiogram, which lead to her being admitted to the emergency room in Anchorage on Friday May 18th. The doctors informed us that her heart was only functioning at 10% efficiency, and the fluid in her lungs and swelling in her abdomen were actually an edema caused by her weak heart not being able to pump fluids properly.  After spending two days in the cardiac intensive care unit where more testing was conducted, the Anchorage cardiologists told us they had ordered an emergency medevac from Anchorage to the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. Two hours later we were in a jet headed South. Upon arriving at UWMC they ran every test under the sun and declared there is no real chance that her heart is going to heal on its own. They took her into surgery and installed a temporary heart pump to keep her other organs from shutting down while they figure out a way forward. Today the lead cardiac doctor informed us that she will have to have a more permanent pump installed and she will be placed on the heart transplant list. She is currently at the top of the list based on how sick her heart is, but because she has type O blood, she can only accept other type O hearts. They gave us an estimated wait of six months to a year to find a suitable heart, but also said there’s really just no way to know how long it could take. One could become available tonight. Either way, the road ahead is going to be exceedingly difficult for Kristin and our entire family. We will have to sell our home in Eagle River and relocate close to Seattle so that we can be close to the hospital if a heart becomes available, or if something goes wrong with the battery operated heart pump she will be wearing every second of every day until the donor heart arrives. She will not be able to continue working, but hopefully I can get a transfer to Renton, SeaTac, or some other airport in the area.  This brings me to the bush I’ve been trying to beat around. We simply can not afford all of the costs we are about to accrue. I have no idea how much of this million dollar (I wish I was exaggerating) procedure will be covered by our insurance, but I am certain that they will not cover the cost of us having to relocate to Seattle, and with Kristin not being able to work for the foreseeable future, we are officially living outside our means. Just before we left Anchorage, the head cardiac nurse came in the room and gave us a talk about what we should expect. One thing she hit on several times was that we had to start a crowd fund as soon as possible, because not even the best insurance covers all the unforeseen costs associated with a heart transplant and the life changes that follow. Several other people who we love and respect told us the same, so I’m taking their advice. I’m coming with my hat in my hand, more afraid than I’ve ever been of anything in my life. I made this page on the advice a woman who’s seen many families suffer from the monetary burden of heart transplant surgery and the subsequent treatment. I feel embarrassed and ashamed to even ask for money, but if it gives my wife a better shot at living a happy, healthy life, I will do whatever it takes. If you can spare a couple bucks, we would be more grateful than I can possibly ever tell you. If not, we completely understand. Please just keep my Beautiful Wife in your thoughts and prayers.

The incident occurred on the north ridge of Mount Conness, where Adrien was climbing at around 11,400 feet, near the base of the Conness Glacier. He was scrambling up a talus field to the base of the climbing route when a large rock, weighing around 4,000 pounds, gave way and pinned his leg against a boulder below.Thanks to the efforts of two hikers who were nearby, the Mono County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue were able to locate Adrien, and after some difficulty launching their own helicopter due to heavy smoke in the area, they were able to free Adrien and evacuate him, with the help of a National Guard UH-60 Blackhawk that was close by on fire assignment.When Adrien arrived at the Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, he was in critical condition, but thanks to the hospital's medical staff, and the quick thinking of the hikers who first reported his location, his life was saved. Tragically, they had no choice but to amputate his right leg above the knee.Everyone at Hagens Berman Axeon is deeply saddened by the news and our thoughts and prayers are with Adrien's family and friends at this difficult time.We have set up this page to help with medical expenses and are asking the cycling community to join our efforts.

From all of us working on jim's recovery support team thank you so much for all of your generosity, shares and prayers. We knew we could raise this money but we are all awed that we were able to raise it this quickly. We thoughtfully came up with our goal amount by discussing future anticipated costs with Stephanie. We did our best to come up with an accurate monetary reflection of what recover would look like for jim and his family. However the reality is we don't exactly know what is in store. We know medical costs will be high and we know there will be an extensive recovery time when jim won't be working. Now that we have raised our goal, let's continue to show the McDonald family our love and support with our continued donations, shares, and prayers. Thank you! Thank you!__________________________________________________Friends, family and wider community, we reach out today with an urgent call for help. Our dear friend, jim mcdonald had a massive heart attack on May 25th while he was traveling in Scotland. A well-hidden flaw in a heart we all know to be a source of joy, love and compassion finally made itself known. In addition to the heart attack he developed a serious complication that resulted in emergency surgery. He is currently in critical but stable condition, is under sedation, and while he is expected to make a full recovery, the journey there will be long. Stephanie and the kids are on their way to Scotland to be with jim now, and are expecting to be there for up to 6 weeks, until jim is allowed to travel home. A heart attack is always a serious and life-threatening emergency, when it happens thousands of miles away, in a foreign country, the difficulties and costs faced by the family multiply infinitely. jim is a husband, and father of three, who supports his family through teaching. We’re asking today for your help in supporting jim, and his family, through this enormously hard moment in time. We need help paying for travel for his wife, Stephanie and their three children. We need your help paying for their time in Scotland during jim’s convalescence. We need help paying for jim’s surgery and recovery time in the hospital. And finally, as Jim begins his recovery, we need your help filling in the gaps that the loss of several months income will mean for his family. It’s a big ask; but if not his community, and his friends, who else? To help keep the McDonalds afloat in this storm is going to take all of us, pitching in, how and where we can. The first, best and most direct help you can give, is through this GoFundme effort. Literally every dollar counts. If jim’s teaching, his herbs, his goodness, his questionable wit, and undeniable enthusiasm has ever touched you, please consider taking this time to show that love back in his time of need. Please share this GoFundMe far and wide: 5 dollars from a stranger matters. 10 bucks from one of your coworkers makes a difference. And finally, in whatever version of prayer you practice, please hold jim and his family in your hearts. Keep the good intentions and healing love flowing so that we can have him back to talking about prog rock soon.We are all so lucky to be a part of jim’s community, be it local or extended around the world. This is our chance to do something together, to rally and support them, so that jim and his family can heal.With our deepest gratitude, jim's recovery support team.............................................................................(also, jim is a very popular man— please understand that Stephanie is overwhelmed, and is asking for privacy so that she can focus on her family.

Medical,4,Help Blanca beat cancer,https://www.gofundme.com/helpblancamorell,"BOSTON, MA","May 2, 2018","$50,000","$120,888","Hello all, My name is Begoña Morell and I am from Madrid, Spain. My sister Blanca Morell has been diagnosed with a very rare kind of cancer and would like to share her story with you. Any donations will go directly to help our parents pay for the medical expenses of her illness.We appreciate your support, prayers, and caring messages more than you can imagine. We would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.————Here is what Blanca would like to transmit to you: My name is Blanca Morell, I am 22 years old, I live in Madrid, Spain, and I have been diagnosed with cancer. I have a type of cancer in my spinal cord called Diffuse Anaplastic Astrocytoma, grade III. It is a very, very unusual cancer, as it is commonly developed by elderly people in the brain, not by young people in the spinal cord. Since it is located in my spinal cord (the part of the nervous system that transmits all of the signals to my extremities) it cannot be operated on, and when treated with radiation or chemotherapy, there is a risk that I will become quadriplegic. Being an atypical cancer, where the nervous system cells degenerate and mutate into fast-growing malignant cells, there is not a definitive treatment or solution. In this type of cancer the malignant cells mix with healthy cells along the entire spinal cord, making it very difficult to eliminate it without damaging the healthy cells.I have already lost sensitivity in my feet and legs, I don't feel anything below my chest, and I cannot walk due to a surgery I went through to be able to do a biopsy, so I must now move in a wheelchair. One of the few treatment options that can be used to fight this cancer is Proton (Radiation) Therapy. It is a very complex and expensive treatment that requires special facilities that cannot be found in Spain, and only exist in very few places in the U.S. and in Europe.Thanks to the love of my parents and their sacrifices, we have moved to Boston so that I can be treated in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where Proton Therapy is available and where there are some of only a few professionals in the world with experience in treating this cancer.The treatment consists on 42 sessions, and costs $300,000 which my parents must pay out of pocket (since neither public nor private insurances in Spain cover these treatments). In addition, there are other expenses such as appointments with my neuro-oncologist and radiotherapist, MRIs, CT simulations, etc. that raise the cost to over $400,000.  Additionally, we need to rent an apartment in Boston for the two months that I must stay for my treatment. I would like to collect funds to help my parents pay for the medical costs of my illness. Thank you so much for your donations and continued support. May God repay you",1.1k,2.3k,2,"1,117",4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Randy was diagnosed with an aggressive sarcoma cancer in his right leg in March 2017, and stopped working as a doctor at that time. Over the last 13 months Randy has undergone 6 different surgeries, had to be admitted for hospitalization on 6 other occasions, he has seen his sarcoma metastasize into his lungs so that he now has Stage 4 cancer, and he has had countless numbers of doctors appointments, treatments (chemo, immunotherapy, hydration, etc.), scans, therapies, etc.Randy's last surgery in January required him to have a complete amputation of his right leg and half of his pelvis as the only option to deal with the sarcoma that could not be controlled otherwise. That procedure alone required Randy to spend a month hospitalized and rehabbing. Fortunately, Randy is feeling better now that the sarcoma was fully removed with his leg, and his lung tumors are decreasing with continued immunotherapy.However, the only path for Randy to regain some normalcy and to be able to go back to work as a leading facial plastic surgeon in the Baltimore area...is to get a prosthetic leg which comes with a $20K copayment that Randy and his family are responsible for.Based on the costs of this prosthetic, and the significant expenses that have accumulated with all of Randy's procedures/appointments described above...Randy and his family are in significant debt and need as much financial assistance as possible. The goal of this fundraising ($50K)...if met...will cover a portion of their expenses incurred so far, and will provide a huge help to Randy and his family (his wife Marisa and two sons - Enzo and Leo).Randy is a private and proud individual, which is why many of you who know Randy are hearing about this for the first time. He had hoped to be able to handle this on his own, but this nefarious cancer he has been fighting for over 13 months now...has proven to be too much financially for Randy and his family to handle on their own. And, they need our collective help to manage the financial obligation of everything that the family has endured so far and continues to deal with.Randy has spent years and countless hours studying to become a renowned Facial Plastic Surgeon so that he could dedicate his professional life to helping hundreds if not thousands of people live a better life. Randy has volunteered his time and services on two separate occasions to go to Mexico and Nicaragua to perform cleft lip and cleft palate repairs, and fix nose and ear birth defects on children who couldn't afford the medical procedures. Randy is also a co-founder and co-director of the Greater Baltimore Cleft Lip & Palate Team, which is a group of providers that performs pro-bono services to Maryland kids with birth defects affecting their face. For those who have never had the pleasure to meet Randy, you would be hard-pressed to meet a friendlier and more caring person. It’s cliché, but Randy “would absolutely” give you the shirt off his back if you needed it and he just met you. Therefore, it is no surprise that Randy persevered to develop the medical skills and expertise to help and make a positive difference in the lives of his patients dealing with various types of facial traumas, defects, reconstructions, etc.Therefore, please consider making a donation to allow him to get the prosthetic leg that he needs to get back to work, to help his family manage the significant debt accumulated from his battle with cancer, and to let Randy do what he does best...make a positive difference in the lives of his patients and everyone he meets.A donation of any kind will be greatly appreciated and a huge help. Also, please feel free to forward on the link to anyone you think might be interested in supporting the Capone family cause.Please use the contact information on the page If you have any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of this effort to help Randy and his family.",585,764,14,520,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

On May 23, Jim received a call that his potassium levels were dangerously low, and he should make his way to the ER immediately. Jim was admitted that evening, and since he had not had much of an appetite for a couple weeks, an endoscopy was performed on May 25. The GI doctor biopsied Jim's stomach and told Jim and Mary he was 'very concerned' with what he saw. Given it was Memorial Day weekend, results would take several days to return. Jim went home on Sunday, May 27, knowing he and Mary just had to wait for the results. On Tuesday, May 29, Jim was back in the ER. His legs were cramping, and he felt very tired. Low potassium was the culprit again. And Jim was admitted....again. Finally, on Thursday, May 31, the pathology returned, and cancer of the stomach was confirmed. Jim was released from the hospital on Friday morning. Mary was on the phone with Sloan Kettering throughout the day. They would have to wait until early the following week to hear confirmation of an appointment.On Monday, June 4, Jim really was not feeling well. Eating continued to be a challenge, and he was growing weaker. Mary took him back to the hospital and he was admitted....again. Early Tuesday morning, Sloan Kettering called with an appointment for the upcoming Friday. Yaay! Finally some good news! But Jim had had a rough night, and he continued to decline. Tuesday afternoon, Jim was transported to Vassar Hospital, and there, Jim and Mary received devastating news: Stage 4, diffuse gastric cancer with carcinomatosis to the abdomen. The cancer in Jim's stomach had spread into his abdomen and around his intestines. Absolutely devastating news.Mary and Jim are the best people I know. They give of themselves continuously to anyone in need or any cause - big or small. 'No' is a word they rarely say, and they never ask for anything in return. Now, they really need our help.Jim, Mary, and their four children are facing a frightening diagnosis and are in the midst of a very tough battle. Uncovered medical expenses, regular bills, and daily needs all are looming. Jim is unable to work. And Mary's focus is on Jim and their children, which is exactly where it needs to be. The support and concern of the community have been overwhelming. Mary and Jim are so very moved and appreciative. Many people have asked how they can help. Along with love and prayers, financial support is the best way to help the Hares right now. I ask you to consider a donation at this very difficult time.

Unconscious, she was rushed to Evanston Hospital where doctors identified over 10 cranial fractures. They measured the severity of her comatose state as 3-4 on the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and at one point were not positive on her ever regaining consciousness.Winnie bravely underwent 4 craniotomies and 3 assisted surgeries, fighting through and waking up from her coma on May 4, 2017.The accident resulted in devastating injuries to her brain, causing her to lose her language capabilities and control over the right side of her body. But what adversity was not able to take was her hope, her grit and her courage. She began rehab immediately. She had to learn to sit and walk again through physical therapy. She slowly regained her memory. She initially could only speak her native dialect 2 months post-coma, then slowly learned to speak mandarin again. She re-learned English. Slowly, but surely, she learned to use her left hand to write. When she couldn’t remember simple words, she just kept writing, writing and writing…Winnie’s progress has been miraculously encouraging, but she still has a long way to go before being able to be function independently. Seemingly routine tasks, such as dressing herself, are a struggle because of her paralyzed right side. Her parents left their jobs in China and flew 16 hours around the world to take care of their only child. They have depleted their savings over the last year and are now at a crossroads.As we come together as a Kellogg family, we remember our conversations with Winnie. She spoke of her beginnings growing up in China, her journeys living and working in Hong Kong and her dreams after attending Kellogg. Winnie's tragic experience hits especially close to home - it could have been any one of us crossing Clark Street that day after class. Winnie at KWEST (Kellogg Worldwide Experiences & Service Trips), August 2016We need your help to support Winnie’s medical expenses in the next year so that her dreams post-Kellogg is a detour and not a dead end. Our campaign goal is $100,000. This will be used in the following ways: － Return tickets to China for the family (estimated at $5,000)－ Rehab treatments in China from July to September 2018 (estimated at $15,000) － Rehab treatments in MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center from October 2018 to August 2019 (estimated at $80,000)Thank you for reading Winnie’s story. We appreciate any help or contribution, no matter how big or small! If possible, please share our campaign link on social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and with your friends. We will keep you posted on the use of funds and her progress going forward.  Any questions, please contact helpwinnieyang@hotmail.com.Lastly, we will end with Winnie’s favourite essay, which she took an hour to copy with her left hand: Hope.Message from Winnie's Parents:

Message from Winnie:

FAQ:Who are we and where are we from?This campaign is led by JJ Luo, Li Qiao, Taylor Chen and Michelle Guo, with the help of a group of Winnie's friends at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. We are raising the fund on behalf of Winnie and her family.Why is fundraising for Winnie necessary now?Winnie’s medical expenses were covered mostly by her student health insurance (with copay) from March, 2017 until now. However, Winnie’s health insurance will end as we graduate this summer, 2018. Her current conditions still require rigorous therapies. She’s unable to complete simple everyday tasks due to the paralysis of her right side. Her energy level tends to run low. Her languages capabilities are improving but still not fluent to communicate effectively in daily life. She and her family were initially hopeful about the legal claims. Unfortunately, she will only receive approximately $60,000 from the accident lawsuit (total amount to be determined in the next 1-2 months). She has no health insurance in China. Over the past 16 months, her parents have exhausted their savings and had to borrow money from friends and family to take care of Winnie in the U.S.. Because Winnie requires full-time care, her parents are unable to work and have no income. Her parents are also having health issues. Very recently, her mom had to take out a loan to undergo an emergent gallstone surgery because she had no health insurance in US. Why does Winnie have to leave the U.S.?Winnie’s student visa status, and health insurance in the U.S. will end this summer. While she’d like to continue to rehab in the U.S., she has to return to China at the end of June.How has Winnie progressed since she got out of her coma?When first waking up from her coma, Winnie recognized no one. She was unable to balance herself sitting up, or speak.She slowly regained her memory. She initially could only speak her native dialect 2 months post-coma, then slowly learned to speak mandarin again. She also re-learnt English. She had to learn to sit and walk again through physical therapy. Now, she can walk with crutches and use her left hand to write and type.Her cognitive progress is promising too. For example, she improved from doing only 1 GMAT question per hour to completing 10 questions per hour in merely a few months.Prior to April 2018, she rehab 5 times a week. Since this May, it was cut to 3 times due to her encouraging progress.What is Winnie’s current condition and daily schedules?After one full year of rehab, Winnie has exceeded her doctor’s expectations. She can now walk with a crutch, use her left hand to write and comprehend course materials. She even audited two classes at Kellogg during the spring of 2018.She goes to the rehab center three times a week. Each session is 3 hours, practising speaking, walking and control of her right hand. Every day, she repeats the efforts at home. In addition, she practises writing, reading and critical thinking analysis at home.What is Winnie’s plan in the future one year?Winnie plans to undergo treatments in Guizhou, China from July to September 2018, before she transfers to MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center in Hong Kong (recommended by her doctors) to continue rehab until August 2019. Why does she choose to head to Hong Kong?Winnie is a Hong Kong citizen. MacLehose Medical Rehabilitation Center in Hong Kong has been recommended by her doctors. The center will continue Winnie’s rehab with speeches, Physical Therapy (PT) and Occupational Therapy (OT).

When she hit her 20's, she found out she carried the gene Ankylosing Spondylitis, which is arthritis affecting the spine and large joints within the body. To treat this, she was taking Humera, an immunosuppressant that weakens the immune system. Because of this, she had contracted a cold, which turned into bacterial and viral pneumonia that put her in the hospital for a month. During that month she had acquired sepsis, a life threatening blood infection. This lowered her chance of living from 70% to 30% in a matter of days, then to 15%. To save her life, they put her on Levophed, a drug which helps regulate blood pressure; it shunted all of the blood from her extremities to her major organs to keep her alive. This resulted in a quadruple amputation. A quadruple amputation is very rare, but necessary. All 4 prosthetics she will need comes to $225,000, which is not covered by her insurance. Tiffany is currently engaged Moe Fonohema. She's been the most humble, positive light that our family has ever had and we've been blessed to welcome her into the family. She is 38 with 6 amazing kids: Nesi 27 (adopted from our family), Davontae 19, Inoke 16, Robbie 10, Mckelvey 7, and Jamison 4. They've been together for 4 years, and all 4 years she's become the biggest blessing our family has had, from letting us have family parties in her own home to letting us feel as though her home was our home. These last 3 months have been difficult for our family because we were dangerously close to losing her. At this point, the medical bills, the cost of the prosthetics, the renovating of the home to accommodate to Tiffany and other things that our family will need to financially support her family, we need all the financial support we can get. There is no one you'll find more deserving, more loving and humble than Tiffany Fonohema. We APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU. She especially sends her love.  If you can't help financially, your love and support is just as appreciated and necessary. Whatever you can donate, it is treasured in every way possible. Lets get Tiffany walking again, back to a normal life again, together. There are plentiful social media platforms, so share where you can and we can achieve this goal together.

I was living a great and happy life in New York City with my wife of two years, had a soaring career in software sales, and a deep passion for running and sailing; Until everything changed.In March 2017, I noticed my right foot wasn’t keeping up with my left and was causing me to trip. I didn’t think much of it until my primary care doctor told me this was a much more serious issue and referred me to the first of what would be many neurologists. I was tested for everything from AIDS to Zika. MRI’s, CT scans, EMG’s, blood tests and painful spinal taps - The results were inconclusive, and the bills were piling up rapidly. The fear of the unknown was causing all sorts of stress – Weight loss, sleeplessness, lack of focus, and the depression was starting to get worse. Still not receiving answers, I enrolled in the second opinion program at the Mayo Clinic. Guided by Dr. Andrew McKeon, my parents and I spent a week in frigid Rochester, MN repeating all the painful tests hoping for answers. As every test result came in, we tried everything we could to interpret each result. We laughed and cried with happiness when we thought it was something simple and panicked and cried together when the simple things were ruled out. We were physically exhausted from the emotional ups and downs. On the last day at Mayo, January 5th, 2018, I was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).Now 38 years old, my world has been turned upside down. My body was quickly failing me. My balance and walking were affected making me fall many times; my hands could barely hold a fork or type an email; And getting dressed was nearly impossible. The fear and anxiety of daily living were increasingly more paralyzing. Moving to my parents house in order to receive the extraordinary care I would need to live out the hardest time in my life meant leaving everything about my life in New York City behind.  I was crushed.A New Chapter and Where We Need your HelpAfter making the transition to my parent’s house, it became obvious the house was not set up to accommodate someone with my needs. Things you don’t typically think about, like widening doorways, renovating the bathroom so I can roll in with the wheelchair, adding ramps, and installing stair lifts to get me from one floor to another. This doesn’t even touch on the need for wheelchairs, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, lawyers, in-home nursing and technological devices to cope with my failing body. None of this is covered by insurance. How Can You Help?We need your support to make the changes necessary and cover the costs of things that insurance won’t. Because of the progression of this disease, we need your support as soon as possible.Please help us reach our goal by sharing this fundraising campaign on your Facebook and Instagram with your friends, family, and colleagues.ALS, also known as Motor Neuron Disease or Lou Gehrig's Disease, has no cure, yet. The average lifespan from diagnosis is two to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for my family and me. What I do know is that I’m focused on doing everything I can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages. As many of my family, friends and coworkers know, I have a strong positive mental attitude and a passion for life. So as difficult and sad as this diagnosis is, I remain positive, and I gather my strength from the outpouring of love and well-wishes from my family and friends, my employer, PerfectoMobile.com, and the men’s group, MDI (mentordiscoverinspire.org ).No one knows how long my fight will last, however I have the will and determination to battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this is already creating a tremendous financial burden on me and my family.  I need your generous help with contributions to help me fight this awful disease and to allow me to have the highest quality of life possible.

Recovery seemed to be going well until three weeks later, when Peter had a devastating stroke while in his doctor’s office. The stroke trauma team worked quickly, but Peter is still facing a long road to recovery. Peter has significant weakness on his left side, which affects his arm and leg, limiting his mobility. Insurance paid for 100 days in a good rehab center with occupational, physical, and speech therapy daily. He had hoped to go home, but that was not in the cards. He’s now in assisted living, with its nursing and aid support, which he needs and which insurance doesn’t pay for. So, from here on out, those costs fall to Peter and Marge. He’ll continue to seek out additional rehabilitation services for PT and OT. He is doing some walking, about 75 steps per session, with the help of a walker and a physical therapist. Slow but steady. Though his body has taken some hard blows, Peter's determination, wit, and humor remain in good form.While Peter and Marge focus their energies on the demands of recovery, many friends and fans of this gifted music-maker are pulling for them wholeheartedly and want to help.

ALS is insidious, robbing its victims of the ability to walk, dress themselves, talk, swallow, and ultimately breathe. All while leaving the mind perfectly intact. Already, I’ve lost all use of my left arm and approximately 60% of my right.  ALS has no cure and no effective treatment. The average lifespan from diagnosis is three to five years. I’m not sure what my journey will bring because every individual’s experience with ALS is different, meaning there are a lot of unknowns for me and my family. What I do know is that I’m focused on doing everything I can to fight this disease and delay its progression into the more debilitating stages. As many know, I have a passion for life. So as difficult and sad as this diagnosis is, I remain positive and gather my strength from the outpouring of love and well-wishes from my family and friends.I’m an outdoors enthusiast and enjoy many activities like fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, skiing and golf. I played football in high school (team captain) and college and have always been passionate about sports. I love live music and have been known to enjoy a concert from time to time. Even though ALS has limited my activities, I continue to find ways to enjoy life by surrounding myself with friends and family. My faith and positive outlook allow me to take it “One Day at a Time” and live one of my favorite mottos “Tour for Life”. On this journey, my family will face extraordinary medical and incidental expenses. ALS treatment is not covered by insurance and estimates for medical costs alone range from $200,000-$300,000 each year, covering ventilation, feeding tubes and in-home care. Additional large expenses may include moving to a new home with greater accessibility, wheelchairs, lifts, a specialized van, long-term clinical trials, aides/in-home nursing and technological devices to offset muscle paralysis. No one knows how long my fight will last, but I’m assuming I’ll battle longer than the average person, and I plan to be here for another 10+ years. Unfortunately, this will leave a tremendous financial burden on me and my family.My wife Peyton and I have three children, and while they may receive some financial aid for college due to my diagnosis, it’s likely that we will still face over $250,000 in additional expenses to finance their educations. It pains me think I will be placing such a burden on them.Peyton and I have dedicated our lives to raising our family and giving whatever possible to the community in New Canaan, CT.

The bottom line is that we felt the situation has degraded in recent months, and Joe was nearing a likely catastrophic outcome.  We hired a professional addiction counselor to travel to Chicago and convince Joe to enter an extended 90+-day program in Florida that is designed for long-term alcoholics who cannot beat the disease.I am extremely pleased to report to you all that we worked with the counselor, Joe’s family, and the new program to transport him down to Florida on June 18 where he officially started this new long-term recovery program.  For now, he is out of Chicago and in safe hands, ideally recovering for good.  I am writing to ask all of you for your help.  We hope Joe will be in Florida for years to come, but no way to know for sure.  If you are in Florida and can visit him, please make time to go see him.  If you have a company that can hire him after his 3-6 month program, please try to do that (he is an MIT grad MBA and a star-man after all!)  Plus we’ve got about $55K of known expenses related to this program.  But we also want to provide him post-program monitoring, counseling, career options, and financial support in order to give him an out-sized chance at a sustained recovery this time.  All-in, we’d like to raise a minimum of $55K to cover the program, with a target of $100K to provide an extended timeline of care and support.  CNQ, this is a rare opportunity where we all have a chance to significantly help a dear classmate and friend before you receive that dreaded graduate death notice in your inbox.   Please donate what you can to help, and check back….if we have not raised our target, please keep giving.  And we ask that you don’t be anonymous, add a note to Joe and show your name and $ amount, large or small, so all can see how we came together as a class to help a friend.  Thank you all for your consideration.  Go Army, CNQ86 rules.Dean Dorman and John Noble",371,150,6,373,1 month,10 days ago,8 days,2018-09-03

I had just moved to Northern Virginia for an engineering job and was pursuing a part-time MBA degree at Georgetown University.I had tons of energy and a positive attitude towards life. On January 6, 2011, I went to the ER with vision problems (blurred and turning sight) and severe shortness of breath. I was told that my lungs were full of blood clots and suspicious nodules. My doctor was surprised I made it alive to the hospital. More scans revealed that I also had a 10x10 tumor in my retroperitonium completely blocking the flow of blood in my IVC and liver lesions. I was diagnosed with Stage 3C testicular cancer. I was immediately taken to surgery. A few days later, I started chemotherapy.  I had lots of complications because I was too sick. After finishing my chemo, I went to Indiana to remove the remaining mass in my abdomen, known as an RPLND surgery. Unfortunately, my remission only lasted 20 months. I was devastated once again when I learned that cancer was back at my regular check=up with my oncologist. I started a different chemo regimen this time, but it failed. After visiting two centers of excellence, I found out that my only option left was to have High Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Transplants. On December 22, 2013, I enrolled in a research trial and started my treatment in Houston, TX.  Unfortunately, the treatment was so toxic that I lost my liver, kidneys and almost my mind with hallucinations and toxins in my body. I developed sepsis right around Christmas, said farewell to my dear parents, and closed my eyes. Miraculously,  I did not die. But, I was totally and permanently disabled with end-stage liver and kidney disease, for which, I had to do dialysis three times a week. I subsequently had two lung surgeries since cancer kept coming back. Since my last surgery, it has been almost three years that I am cancer-free. Unfortunately, I could not really enjoy life with my disabling conditions, too many to write here.  Cirrhosis led to significant ascites that had to be removed by the gallons.  I finally got listed for a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant. My score is relatively high that I am at or near the top of the list depending on the week's blood work results. I may finally be able to get back to a relatively normal life and perhaps even work again. However, not having worked for five years, my condition has put me and my parents in a financial constraint. The costs associated with a transplant are very high, particularly with the life-long expensive medications one needs to take. So, with all that, I and my family would appreciate your support. It is fairly difficult for me to write openly about myself and ask for help.  If you are not able to make a donation, please send your good thoughts and encouragements. We appreciate all your kindness and support at this difficult time. I look forward to becoming a healthy and productive member of our society once again.",610,1.8k,0,613,4 months,2 months ago,-1,2018-09-03

After a trip to the emergency room, a battery of tests and scans, and a lot of agonizing waiting for results, Gerard was diagnosed with both kidney and colon cancer. The devastating news hit Gerard, Nicky and their three small children, Elizabeth, Gina and Stephanie, very hard. But in true Franchi fashion, they immediately took to fighting cancer head on. After Gerard’s abdominal and kidney surgeries, rounds of chemotherapy and many prayers, he received the news that he was all clear! Gerard had beaten cancer.Fast forward to October 23, 2017. On a routine follow-up scan 3 months after Gerard was given the “all clear”, the doctors once again found tumors. At that time the cancer had spread to Gerard’s stomach and liver. Gerard continues to receive chemotherapy treatment at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Currently due to his compromised immune system, Gerard has had to miss or delay treatments. As always, he remains focused on the task of fighting this awful disease. He is determined to overcome the odds. The old adage of ”taking it one day at a time” has never rung more true for Gerard, his family and friends. Gerard’s positive outlook on an uncertain future is inspiring. Despite the emotional rollercoaster of the past year and a half, Gerard continues to embody what it means to be a fighter, a husband and a father.The Franchi's have made it through these trying times with the love and support of their family and friends and their faith in God. Everyone around them has been extremely generous whether in the form of gift cards, meals, donations or a simple phone call to check in. The constant outpouring of care and love has meant the world to them. The reality of a fight such as this and Gerard’s determination to provide for his family, has continued to push him forward.After careful discussion with Gerard’s medical team the decision has been made for Gerard to stop working. Chemotherapy has taken a great toll on his body and immune system. This is a very emotional and difficult decision for Gerard. His brother Bobby, and everyone at R.A.Franchi Corp. made it possible for Gerard to work up until this point,he could not have done it without you.As of July 1st , Gerard will begin the 5-month waiting period prior to receiving Social Security Disability benefits. This campaign is in place to help lessen the financial burden on the Franchi family during this exceptionally challenging time. Thank you for supporting this beautiful family. #franchistrong",717,1.6k,4,724,2 months,1 month ago,1 month,2018-09-03

After investigating a stiff neck, something didn't ""sit right"" with our amazing pediatrician and she ordered blood-work. Follow up blood work in the Hackensack ER turned from just anemia to a small mass on his kidney to a CT Scan that showed a much bigger problem. Every corner we have turned has been devastating. We are currently residents of the Pediatric Oncology Department at Hackensack University Medical Center and are being treated by a very very large team of Doctors, NPs, Nurses, Techs, and more specialists than you can imagine.

This is the only desire for 34-year old mom, Leena, from the moment she gets up in the morning to the second she falls asleep.  Just a month ago, Leena was suffering from prolonged cold-like symptoms and finally ended up in an urgent care facility. She was found to have a mass in her lung and was sent directly to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. They had found a large tumor in her right lung. For Leena, a non-smoker, and her husband, Kuldeep, this was earth-shattering news. They lived a simple life, a family of three with little Neel being the center of their hearts.  The diagnosis was absolutely devastating. They went from thinking this was a persistent cold to being told that she has advanced lung cancer. Since then it has been a roller-coaster ride for the family, running around and working with a network of friends trying to identify the right hospital, oncologists and, most importantly, the treatment path to cure this evil disease.In the following days, Leena went through a series of biopsies, scans and other tests.  Every visit to a hospital and lab became a nightmare for the family as it brought more devastating and scarier news.  Also, taking along a baffled little Neel to the hospitals with his mom instead of his pre-K classes is no small task, as you can imagine.  Two days later, a brain scan revealed more shattering news- a 2.5 cm tumor was found in her brain.  Furthermore, scans showed that the cancer had spread to her abdomen. She was told she had Stage IV disease. There was no time for them to think, ""Why me?""  On April 27th, Leena was admitted to the George Washington University Hospital.  She was lucky to find one of the best neurosurgeons to remove her tumor.  He was set to go on vacation but decided to take on her case.  With the blessing of guru P.P.

They are the kindest-hearted and most generous people in the world, and now it is our chance to help them as they have helped so many others. They have been traveling a very tough road for a while now, and unfortunately more difficult times lay ahead. Kim’s 100-mile charitable races have been replaced with a struggle to complete the simplest of daily tasks.  After a very long period of uncertainty, misdiagnoses and straight-up dismissal of obvious symptoms, Kim D’Arcy was finally diagnosed with Severe Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease (CNL) and several other co-infections know as babesia and bartonella. Kim is now living with a host of multi-systemic neurological and physical ailments including debilitating fatigue, profound memory loss, extreme migraine-like symptoms, severe pain and swelling in her joints, night sweats, body spasms, and breathing issues.  She is undergoing very intense treatments on a daily basis in hopes of killing off the spirochetes that make up Lyme disease and co-infections.  She had a PICC line implanted in Oct 2017 and is being treated with intravenous IVs five days a week, as well tons of AM and PM oral antibiotics.   While there are many parts of this chapter in their lives that straight up suck, one of the most difficult is how hard it has hit them financially. Outrageously, Chronic Neurological Lyme is not recognized by the CDC in the US and therefore treatment is not covered by insurance companies. So ALL of the expenses in testing, diagnosing and treating Kim’s very legitimate illness have been paid OUT OF POCKET by the family. This, as you can imagine, is an expense that is beyond the scope of imagination for any of us and is ruinously unsustainable.  Kim is going to be faced with approximately 2 more years of treatments, possibly more. Additionally, Kim and John’s two beautiful children, Lilly and Jack, will have to undergo their own rounds of intense testing as Kim’s strain of Lyme could have been transferred to them in-utero. These kids are ROCKSTARS and have been through more than their fair share of hardships for such little loves.The goal is to raise $60,000.00 to help with the family’s medical expenses now and for the next couple of years. After comprehensive research and consultation with doctors and specialists, due to the severity of her condition, Kim has been advised to enter an intensive treatment center in Germany where she has been offered a spot at the St. George Klinik. Germany recognizes Chronic Neurological Lyme disease as a major health issue and the clinic there offers a state-of-the-art Hyperthermia Treatment program that has been very successful in treating others with this debilitating disease. Kim and John have been in direct contact with some of these patients and their results have been amazingly positive. Because of her advanced stage of this disease, Kim must take action NOW. Her spot at St. George is guaranteed for June 25th! The treatment is done over a three week period, it is very expensive and it is not covered by insurance.  They need our support to get Kim well and give them all a last chance to return to a normal life. Will you please join me in helping out the D’Arcy family, who have always been there for others? They would never ask for themselves, so I am asking for them – let’s be there for them… no family could be more deserving.  For more info on this treatment and testimonials of those who have successfully been though the process please click here:  www.St-george-hospital.com",465,622,0,467,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Medical,7,Garrett Roe fund,https://www.gofundme.com/garrett-roe-fund,"SANTA ANA, CA","August 11, 2018","$100,000","$86,882","On Thursday, August 9, my fiancé, Garrett Roe, suffered a stroke at the age of 32. He is alive thanks to the wonderful staff at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, however words can not describe how devastated we are. Garrett is an A320 First Officer for JetBlue and is based in Long Beach, CA. He was born and raised in the state of Washington. Garrett has always had a passion for airplanes and he started flying at the age of 18.  When not in the air he enjoys boating, mechanics, working out, and spending time with friends.  His positive energy and generousity are an inspiration to all who know him.  On August 9th, Garrett woke up with complaints of a headache. He got up, made coffee and went in to the bathroom to get ready for work. Seconds later, I glanced over and saw him on his stomach using the door frame to pull himself out of the bathroom. The look on his face was a look I will never forget. I ran over to him and his eyes were open but moving side to side, and he was drooling and clenching his jaw. His body was overly tense and he kept trying to stand but could not. When the medics arrived, they made the decision to airlift him to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. The helicopter landed at Harborview and within 10 minutes of landing Garrett had had a brain scan where they located the clot, and was undergoing surgery where it was successfully removed.  Garrett ended up suffering from an ischemic stroke caused by a carotid artery dissection. This means that he had a tear in the 2 inner layers of his carotid artery...the blood pooled and formed a clot. The clot then traveled to the brain and caused him to have a stroke. Approximately one-third of the left hemisphere of his brain developed damage. This has caused paralysis of the entire right side of his body and the inability to talk and communicate. This is the start of a very long road for Garrett. He will need immense therapy and rehab to get his body working again coupled with a large amount of support from family and friends to keep his spirits high. His mother Tanya, and I appreciate all of the love and support we have already received! This is going to take an army but with strength, love and prayer we are confident that we will get Garrett back to the way he was!I will be updating along the way as we go through this journey together.

Rainier, the highest mountain in the State of Washington · Become a top salesperson at one of the most successful technology start-ups in the history of Seattle · Become an avid addict of physical endurance, including daily visits to his local cross-fit gym · Strived to become a model for fuel efficiency with his ownership of awkwardly massive trucks (that one's a joke - but not really...;) In early 2016 the tumor had advanced and by the end of the year had transformed into a stage 4 terminal Glioblastoma.  (Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM ), to be specific)  Since that time, it's been a roller-coaster of highs and lows for Mike, for his friends, and especially for his family.   The one take-away most of us close friends and family share is our awe of Mike's undaunted strength and relentless fight through this time.  The guy is a Clydesdale -there is no other person on earth who could have fought this thing harder.  It's been both admirable and heartbreaking to watch... Two of the things that weighed heaviest on Mike throughout this time was the legacy he’d leave behind to his kids, and what he would be able to do to care for his family after he was gone.  Many of the people reading this will undoubtedly be involved in the legacy part.  We'll ensure that his kids be exposed to all of the things that made their dad smile, we'll ensure they know the man their father was, how much he cared for them, and they'll know the tremendous amount of love he had for both of them.As it pertains to the concern about taking care of his family, well, that's what this is about.   This is a call-out for any and all people who ever knew Mike and Agnes, who were friends to them, family to them, who worked with them or may have met them through other mutual friends.  This is our chance to make a splash.  This is our chance to support Mike's wishes and show this family the support group that they have.  Mike passed away Wednesday, May 23rd at 12:12am at his home. He was surrounded by his family and loved ones. His passing was peaceful and without pain. Even though the family has insurance, the out of pocket expenses are piling up and staggering.  As friends to the family, we feel the least we can do in this situation is to help take some of this off of their plate ,and see to it that they receive the utmost support.  All of the money raised from this campaign will go towards the family’s everyday costs associated with Mike’s illness.This is your chance to help.

Medical,7,Proton Therapy for Zach Rizzuto,https://www.gofundme.com/zachproton,"FORT MYERS, FL","March 25, 2018","$125,555","$126,635","My husband Zach was an otherwise healthy 37-year old man until summer 2017. Zach was diagnosed with brain cancer in August 2017, just less than three months after the birth of our daughter, Roxanne. He has undergone three brain surgeries - one biopsy and two craniotomies - to diagnose and resect a huge brain tumor. The tumor has been diagnosed with brain cancer, anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III ) to be exact.  This campaign was created to help us raise money for his proton beam radiaton therapy treatment since his health insurance carrier denied it because their medical directors, Dr. Ellen Rabun and Dr. Joan Huppi , claimed the treatment is unproven and not medically necessary. We disagree. More importantly, Zach's doctors in Philadelphia and Fort Myers disagree. So, we're reaching out to you for help. Thanks in advance for reading our story!Three institutions reviewed Zach’s MRI scans and pathology - Gulf Coast Medical Center, Duke University, and the University of Pennsylvania . The recommended treatment for his condition is tumor resection surgery followed by 6-weeks of radiation and chemo (Temodar), and then 12-months of chemo maintenance. Zach can receive either photon radiation or proton radiation, but we appealed UnitedHealthcare to approve the proton radiation three times because it uses a lower dose of radiation which can reduce the long and short-term side effects, including protecting cognitive abilities and lowering risk for more cancers to develop. It is the preferred treatment due to the location of his tumor cells in his brain. Proton radiation has a reduced side effect profile, which means Zach could have less neurocognitive side effects and the left side of his brain’s healthy tissue would be protected from the damaging effects of radiation. He will experience side effects with either form of radiation but would be able to have a better quality of life if he has proton radiation. This is critical for our family because he is still a young man, has a ten-month-old daughter, and is in the middle of his professional career.We are grateful and appreciate each of you for your kindness, support, and generosity. Thank you for sharing our story with others. I can promise you that we will pay it forward someday. We will also be sure to teach Roxanne about the love that exists in this world and remind her that there are so many good people in her life.We take great pride in being fiscally responsible individuals. We wish we could pay for Zach’s treatment in full with our savings, but we don’t have enough saved, and it would take us too long to get the amount needed without drastically delaying his treatment (and risking tumor regrowth). We also have medical bills from his previous surgeries to pay. His proton treatments will cost $125,554.11. Fifty-percent of his treatment ($62,777.05) must be paid before he can begin. The remaining fifty-percent must be paid in 5 payments of $12,555.41 over five months after treatment. There are no other payment plan options available for proton therapy at Penn. Zach will also receive very little of his income (if any) during his six weeks of treatment because we have to be in Philadelphia. We hope he can return to work fully soon after, and that is one of the main reasons we have been fighting for proton radiation over traditional radiotherapy. There will be neurocognitive side effects for either type of treatment, but they are lessened with proton therapy. Since Zach’s radiation will be on his brain, it is critical to preserve as much healthy brain tissue as possible in order to maintain his quality of life and cognitive functions after treatment.Longer StoryHow did you find it?Zach experienced several confusion/disorientation/staring episodes in 2017, just before and after Roxanne was born. He initially convinced me they were caused by the stress he was under at work. I finally got him to go to a doctor in early August, and an MRI was ordered. We were called back into the office on the same day the MRI was performed. I knew the news could not be good. Thankfully, my mom had been staying with us for a few weeks to help me with Roxanne as I started to transition back to work. We were told Zach had a 7 cm mass (described as huge in the report) on the right temporal lobe of his brain. We now know the episodes he was experiencing were absent seizures. He never even had a headache, which is amazing. We immediately met with oncologists and a neurosurgeon in Florida to find out what to do. A biopsy surgery was performed on August 23rd (when Roxanne was just about 3-months old). His biopsy results were inconclusive because the hospital in FL did not have a neuropathologist on staff, but lymphoma was ruled out. The slides were sent to the Mayo Clinic for an expert consult and his MRI scans were sent to the Duke University Brain Tumor Center.  The initial pathology from the Mayo Clinic indicated the tumor was a low-grade glioma (grade II). The news wasn’t the best or worst we could receive. We waited several weeks for Duke to get back to us and eventually the neurosurgeon called and talked to Zach about removing the tumor. We were not immediately comfortable with the discussion, so I decided on a whim to reach out to the brain tumor program at the University of Pennsylvania since we were going to NJ for my nephew's first birthday anyway. My experience working with a nurse navigator at Penn was impressive. We were able to get three appointments scheduled with experts in less than ten days. The appointments were long but eye-opening, hopeful, and thorough. The surgeon showed us the intricacies of Zach’s tumor on his MRI scans, and the Medical Oncologist drew out an entire plan with us while we were sitting there. He also taught us about the molecular variations in brain tumors and described why those were important to understand. It was the first time since Zach’s initial MRI that we felt some positivity again. It was also the first time we left an appointment and could smile. We immediately felt that Penn was the best place for Zach’s surgery and adjuvant treatments.Why three brain surgeries?The first resection surgery was a success (90-95% of tumor removed), but the initial thought was his tumor was grade II at the time. Everything at that point was textbook grade II. It wasn’t until the post-op pathology of the larger sample that doctors discovered it was more of an intermediate grade II/grade III, which can be more aggressive. So, the surgeon recommended going back in to get more of the remaining tumor out, which would cause Zach to essentially lose the peripheral vision in his left eye. Zach wishes he could have raised his hand during the first surgery and told the surgeon to remove more the first time, but obviously that wasn’t an option. The second resection surgery was also a success and 95-99% of the tumor was removed. There is still a small amount of tumor in his brain because it was dangerously located near a critical blood vessel and was inoperable.What about work?Zach’s company was acquired early in 2017 and he was told he would be laid off by the new company later that summer. He was offered a new position at another company (during Hurricane Irma) and accepted. However, FMLA cannot be used unless you have worked for an organization for at least 12-months. He has had some short-term benefit payments, but those have been exhausted. My employer has been amazing to work with, and I have been able to keep up with my job, thankfully. I have a wonderful manager and team and they have been so supportive and caring. I am very lucky! I cannot use FMLA either because I used most of my available time for maternity leave. Lesson learned - try your best not have multiple family medical issues in the same 12-month time frame! Zach cannot drive because of the seizures, so I must drive him everywhere, including to work and doctors' appointments. I often have to miss meetings and events at work to do so.  Many of you know how much Zach loves driving and cars - they were his passion. This has been extremely difficult for him. My dad has also been living with us in FL since he started a new job in Fort Myers in September. My mom, aunt, and brother have been a great support system and babysitters for Roxanne during our time in NJ/PA. We have Roxanne in a wonderful child care facility while I am working. It is expensive, but it has allowed her to have some routine and consistency in her life, for which we are grateful. The caregivers have become a second family for her.Detailed Diagnosis (Pathology) - Anaplastic Astrocytoma, Grade III GliomaZach was initially diagnosed with a low-grade glioma (WHO grade II). After his first tumor resection surgery, pathology indicated there were pockets of anaplasia, which means some cells were actively dividing and the tumor was more of an intermediate grade II/III. This means we need to be very aggressive in his treatment plan because tumors can recur and grow into higher grades. Zach does have several molecular markers that make his tumor more treatable than others. We’re told his tumor has 2 out of the 3 that respond well to chemo and radiation treatment, but we cannot delay.Recommended TreatmentTumor resection surgeryTemodar (chemotherapy pill) - during radiation and 12-months following radiationProton Radiation - 6-weeks at Penn Medicine in PhiladelphiaCost: $125554.11 ($62777.05 due prior to treatment; five-month installments of $12555.41)TimelineSpring/Summer 2017 - absent seizures observed by MelAugust 9, 2017 - Meet with GP to Discuss Episodes (first doctor appointment with a GP ever while I was married to Zach)August 14, 2017 - MRI in the morning, Called into office in the afternoon.

It meant Poppy would not run into major complications for a few days and we could figure out how to get her to the states. That put a lot of pressure on us. We lived in LA and that was where Poppy and my wife had insurance coverage. It made the most sense to us to try to fly her there for care. Maggie spent many hours on calls with her insurance company doing her best to stress the nature of the situation. They bounced her around from extension to extension and made things extra impossible for us to ensure an air evacuation. They tried to send us a regular airplane without physicians and our doctor caught that when she called them to make sure they were sending the correct plane. The insurance contracted a Mexican plane with the right equipment and personnel that we felt confident could do the job. Our prayers had been answered and Poppy could be in LA in a day and a half. We breathed a little easier and felt relieved that was happening. The company called us two hours before departure and informed us there was a landing gear malfunction and they couldn’t come. Insurance had failed us multiple times. Me,my wife her aunts and father were in the room when that news came in and you could feel the hope just leave out all at once. We all panicked. My wife cried and we just felt we were out of options. The doctor came in and handed my wife a list of people with planes and helicopters that served the west coast and when my wife called a few they responded. “Lady I can’t fly emergency missions to Mexico” It was then that I entered the small little bathroom in the hospital room that i dropped to my knees and with tears in my eyes and cried out. “God show me your will for this baby. Show us where you want us to go” I promise you not thirty seconds after i walked outta that bathroom the doctor asked to speak with me in the hallway where she said. “I know a doctor in Miami.” I stopped her right there and immediately said “go now and please call them” i knew from the moment i heard Miami that that was where gods will was. I walked back into the room with my family and announced “Poppy is going to Miami” My wife responded with “Miami? How will we do that? She’s not covered there and it’s so far from our home.” I said i don’t know but that’s what we’re going to do. So here we are today in Miami.

My name is Rose, and my family and I are asking you to please help save my brother John's life. John is 35 years old and is currently battling an aggressive, life-threatening brain tumor called a glioblastoma (GBM). The average prognosis for a GBM patient is 12-15 months. There is no standard treatment for recurrent brain cancer and this presents both a financial and medical challenge. John’s current treatment plan includes Avastin and Keytruda infusions, but these treatments are not curative, so we have been tirelessly searching for more options. Through outreach to many doctors and foundations, John has been offered an opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment that is not covered by insurance. Please help John in his battle with brain cancer!In 2012, John was a typical 29 year-old living in Chicago, building a successful career, and engaged to the love of his life, Allyson. One day at work, John was in a meeting and very abruptly started seizing and was rushed to the emergency room. Everything changed for John and our family that day. John was diagnosed with an anaplastic astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer. He underwent an awake craniotomy which removed 60-70% of the brain tumor. Immediately after surgery, John started radiation, chemo, and adopted lifestyle changes which doctors and researchers thought would be helpful.(Here is John after his first surgery with his neurosurgeon, Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa (Dr.Q),  in 2012)From 2013 to 2017, the conventional treatments helped stabilize John’s tumor and John and Allyson started a family by welcoming first Dennis (now almost 4 years old) and then Matthew (now 1 year old). John continued to work, but also committed himself to encouraging others fighting for their lives through the Livestrong Foundation. He has spoken at and participated in numerous Livestrong events to help inspire others, all while continuing his own fight. (John, Allyson, Dennis (3), Matthew (1))Last May (’17), just a few weeks after Matthew was born, John went in for a routine MRI that produced devastating news; the tumor suddenly showed significant growth. This time the tumor was so aggressive that he started losing some of his vision and speech. In January (’18), John underwent his second awake craniotomy which was more invasive and painful than the first. The initial news was promising as Dr.Q and his team were able to get almost 90% of the tumor.(John in the ER on Christmas Eve 2017- always smiling!)However, the pathology results came back with the worst news to date- John’s recurrence was now a GBM. A month post-surgery the tumor had grown back to its original size, and a new tumor was found shortly after.  Despite all of this, John continues to be the most positive, empathetic and loving person you will ever meet. I think anyone who knows him agrees that he has a smile that is uplifting and a demeanor that can change the entire tone in a room. John is a fighter and he is determined not to lose this battle!

(Watch this video of John featured on the news as he was biking across Iowa at Ragbrai 2015. He talks about overcoming obstacles and staying positive!)This is where we need your help. John has serious vision and speech impairments which have ended his ability to work. Through outreach to many doctors and the foundations working to cure brain cancer, John has been offered a promising opportunity to participate in a new alternative treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment is not covered by insurance. The cost for this treatment is substantial, around $100,000, and the need to start is urgent! To date, John and Allyson have paid for all medical costs in excess of insurance, but this is more than our family can handle. Please know that we would not ask for this help if we did not feel it was completely necessary. By donating to this cause, you are helping my brother get the treatment he needs to keep fighting! Additionally, your donations will enable doctors to pursue these leading edge treatments in research that potentially could save others from this horrible disease. Any funds raised that do not go towards treatment will be put towards providing John’s young boys a secure future.Thank you in advance for all your love and support!(Family with Santa!

We would be profoundly grateful for any contribution and for the diffusion of this heartfelt appeal among friends and people sensitive to this struggle.Many thanks.En algún momento de nuestras vidas, todos hemos sido afectados por el cáncer, ya sea personalmente o ayudando a un ser querido a combatirlo.

El costo es enorme pues afecta física, financiera y emocionalmente al enfermo  y a sus seres queridos.Mi hermano, Alejandro Fernandez de Cossio, fue disgnosticado con cáncer de pulmón a finales de 2014, con un pronostico de 6 meses de vida. El ha sido y sigue siendo un luchador incansable contra la enfermedad y ha superado con éxito una serie de tratamientos y, todavía, se resiste a darse por vencido. El oncólogo de Ale ha realizado la solicitud (rechazada) y tres apelaciones para lograr el tratamiento con Alecensa (Alectinib), continuacion del Crizotinib, que se le aplico cuando todo parecia perdido en marzo de 2017, re expandiendole el pulmon colapsado y disminuyendo considerablemente la masa tumoral en el mediastino. Lamentablemente el burocratismo y, lo que es peor, la negación a curar a un enfermo por el elevadisimo precio de la medicina que necesita, hacen imposible que Ale pueda acceder a la misma: el seguro no la cubre.El costo del Alecensa en USA es de $15,158 dólares por 240 capsulas (2 meses de tratamiento).  https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/alecensaCubrir un año de tratamiento ascendería a alrededor de $90,948, cifra imposible de costear por la familia.  Hemos recurrido a  organizaciones, fundaciones, farmacias, etc. pero, hasta ahora, no hemos obtenido resultados. Es por esto que divulgo esta situación pues yo, y los muchos amigos que conocen y quieren a Alejandro, nos resistimos a aceptar ser vencidos y queremos agotar todas las posibilidades.Estaremos profundamente agradecidos con cualquier colaboración y con la difusión de esta apelación entre amigos y personas sensibles a esta batalla contra uno de los flagelos  de la humanidad que continua sufriendo nuestro querido Alejandro.",343,1.3k,7,354,23 days,16 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Many a story can be told of Fritz selflessly giving to others. Whether building houses for the impoverished in Mexico or helping friends through their own personal cancer battles! Recently Fritz was re-diagnosed with Lymphoma. If I have the story correct, he was a survivor 12 years ago and given a Cancer Free diagnosis. Sadly, “C” has returned and it looks like the treatment is going to be more challenging than the first time.Fritz will undergo 3 rounds of potent chemo and for all 3 rounds be admitted to the hospital for 4 days when the medicine is being administered. Following the 3rd treatment, Fritz’s bone marrow will be harvested and frozen. He will then be admitted to the hospital for 5-6 weeks to have the “nuclear chemo” administered in hopes of killing all traces of the “C” and then his bone marrow will be placed back in his body to help produce health cells and help him recover. Following the 5-6 weeks in the hospital, he will be confined at home for an additional 5-6 weeks with a care giver. Fritz’s daughter is leaving her job for this period of time to be her dad’s caregiver.We are raising funds for 3 primary reason. 1. In essence, Fritz will be out of work for 4-6 months. The last thing we want Fritz worrying about is the financial toll this will have on him. We want him to focus on beating “C”s ass! And being healthy.2. While Fritz has health insurance, there is a 7K out of pocket deductible and many of the medicines that Fritz will be prescribed are not covered by the insurance. 3. Any remaining funds will used to help with the loss of income Fritz”s daughter will incur while taking FMLA to care for her dad.Fritz’s first chemo treated started Friday, April 6th.We want to thank all who contribute to this fund raising effort in advance.Chuck and Julia Brown",87,92,12,87,4 months,3 months ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Thank you to each & every one of you who has contributed to Howard’s medical care! We are beyond grateful! Howard has seen the donations, but has been too weak to acknowledge them personally. Three weeks out, he is at home recuperating. It has been a much slower recovery than his other two colon resections, but then again, this surgery was far more extensive and intensive. So far, he is mostly sleeping ...has a few bites to eat or moves to the couch and sleeps again. He has lost 30 pounds, but not his fighting spirit. His Drs said this is par for the course and he is doing great! Many patients take 2-3 months before their appetite and energy return. In the meantime, we are sustained by the compassion of our friends and family and our love for one another. Please continue to keep Howard in your thoughts and prayers!

3/21/2018 Here is an article written by Linda Yang for Colon Cancer Coalition about Howard. Please continue to spread the word and contribute to this campaign. (Link to full article:  https://coloncancercoalition.org/2018/03/15/faces-of-blue-howard-brown/)

I was born in St. Louis in 1966, five minutes later than my twin sister, Cheryl. I grew up in the Boston suburbs of Framingham, Massachusetts, being very active in all sports, but excelled most at basketball. I graduated in 1988 from Babson College in Wellesley, MA, which is the number one college for entrepreneurism in the world. I had a career in high technology – software, Internet, and cloud computing.

I’ve been married to my wife, Lisa Brown, for over 23 years and we have a daughter, Emily, who is a junior in high school. Lisa is my current caretaker, but being diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer has put tremendous stress on the family and me. I am currently on disability and not working because the chemotherapy has been kicking my ass. My wife had neck surgery a few years ago and currently is not working as well. We’re trying to keep things as normal as we can for our daughter, who is an amazing student and a soccer goalie.

My story with cancer started when I was 24-years-old. I was diagnosed with stage IV non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. I failed three different chemo recipes, but my twin sister, Cheryl, was an exact HLA (human leukocyte antigen) match. I had a bone marrow transplant from Cheryl that saved my life at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA on May 24, 1990.

I had blasting chemo and twice daily full body irradiation prior to my bone marrow transplant. I achieved remission, or NED (no evidence of disease) for 28 years until I went for my recommended colonoscopy at age 50. I learned that I had stage III colon cancer and immediately had a colon recession surgery where 13 inches were removed. I started and completed 12 grueling rounds of FOLFOX from August to February. A CT scan revealed that the colon cancer had spread just outside my colon. I had a second colon recession surgery in March 2017, removing 10 more inches, and started immunotherapy stage I clinical trial.

In July of 2017, a CT scan showed metastases to the liver, peritoneal lining, bladder, and outside of the colon. I was now diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. I started a new recipe of Irinotecan/ Avastin for 10 cycles, which have shown some “interval improvement,” what is also known as shrinkage. I was recently approved for CRS-HIPEC (cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy) surgery scheduled for mid-March. I plan on “getting to NED.” I have a daughter that I want to see graduate high school, play college soccer, and walk her down the aisle; get my life back.

I’ve spent my life as an active volunteer in my community. I was the president of the American Jewish Committee (AJC), and am board members of the Jewish Federation, the AJC, and the Hebrew Free Loan. I have raised millions for Jewish communities and people in need. I am a trustee for Babson College, and the board’s president for the Babson Alumni Association.

When I think of “Get Your Rear in Gear,” it means a “call to action.” The call is to recruit participants, volunteers, and fundraisers to support Colon Cancer Coalition in its mission to support colon cancer education, early testing, research, patients, caregivers, and families. This is my second go around with major life threatening chemo. I have a huge worldwide movement and following on Facebook that is called “HBStrong!” I have so many people that love me, pray for me, and follow my journey. Of course I try to keep it as positive as possible. My words of wisdom: cancer sucks, but the beast must be slayed, and that is all I can do each day. Keep the faith.

3/13/2018 Please join us in supporting Howard Brown and his family in their time of need. We are part of the HBstrong Network of college and high school friends that want to support the family during this critical time.
Howard has been battling Stage 4 Colon Cancer (22 cycles of chemo, 2 major colon reconstruction surgeries, immunotherapy).  He faces major life saving surgery on March 13th called CRS HIPEC - see video link

We are launching phase 1 of this contribution campaign to raise $50,000 to help Howard and his family pay for medical bills and other expenses not covered by insurance. Please join us by making a contribution of any size and sharing with others.

Medical,8,"For Our Warrior, Jeff",https://www.gofundme.com/for-our-warrior-jeff,"MORRISTOWN, NJ","August 1, 2018","$85,000","$82,885","To our Family, Friends, and Friends of Friends who have followed Jeff's story....As many of you already know,  life changed for our family in April of 2016.  My brother Jeff Leloia was diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 33.   Before we dive into Jeff's story, I want to first tell all of you about Jeff and for one second, forget about this terrible disease that has changed our lives and his life forever.   My sister and Jeff's story is a true fairytale.  Two teenage kids (18 years old) meeting at the very beginning of college- Quinnipiac University.   Since the day they met, the two of them have been inseparable.    They are the two nicest people you could ever meet.   They never asked for anything out of life besides being happy together and wanting to start a family.    Its a love like no other and one that I look up too everyday.  They have been together since 2001 and married in 2009.   As so many of you know,  I met my husband at Jeff and Alyson's wedding.  Tommy was Jeff's groomsmen and I was the MOH.  From there, it was history.  Tommy and I owe much of our lives to the two of them....   Jeff and Tommy were best friends and now brother in laws. It couldn't have worked out better!     Jeff and Al went onto have 2 children since 2009. Vanessa is 6 years old and the happiest little girl.  Nicholas is 3 and loves trains and giggles at every little thing.    Life as we knew it, was as perfect as it could be.   In April of 2016, everything changed for us when Jeff had a seizure.  I will never forget that day as long as I live. I had just hung up the phone with my sister and within seconds, it happened. Alyson had called back in a panic and I assured her it was probably nothing to worry about.  Boy, do I wish I was right.  Unfortunately after many tests, we discovered a brain tumor was pushing on his motor area (which caused the seizure).  In September of 2016, they removed a Grade 3 brain tumor at Columbia Pres in NYC.  He underwent 6 weeks of radiation and chemo cycles for almost 1 year.   Things seemed to be okay....In October 2017 a questionnable ""spot"" showed up on his MRI and this ""spot"" had been growing on each subsequent MRI, raising concern for a recurrence.  We were told regular standard of care was not going to work (regular chemo) so they opted to find a clinical trial that would hopefully help.  On Jan 22 of 2018, Jeff entered into a Phase 1B clinical trial out of Columbia Pres. in NYC.   Jeff was in the hospital for over 50 days during this trial.  Since he was the first person to enter this specific trial for a long period of time, side effects were not known (but of course, we knew there was a risk).     The trial left Jeff with weakened mobility on one side of his body.   He went to Kessler after the trial to work on getting his strength back.  While the strength on his one side did not come back fully, Jeff's positive attitude remained.  We continued to live life as best we could knowing he would be monitored every 4 weeks with MRI scans.  He came home from Kessler in March of 2018.    As you can imagine, being away from home for almost 2 months was beyond difficult but our warrior never complained.  In May of 2018, his MRI scan came back showing something....doctors were unsure what this was and hoped it was an effect from the trial he had done.  We continued to monitor it.   We planned our family vacation to Lake George in June.  The day before we left for vacation we received news that the latest MRI was still showing this ""effect"" and the doctors believed it was cancer again.     As you can imagine, it was a devastating blow to find out the day before we were supposed to leave....But despite this, we went on our vacation and had the best time.   But are you surprised? That is who Jeff is....Despite overwhelming circumstances in his life, Jeff has never gave in.    I am so proud to be his sister.After our few days away, we knew we would come home and have another battle to fight.    The doctors had suggested they biopsy this new area to determine how best to treat it.   We were told it would be an in and out situation (an overnight) but unfortunately it was not. Jeff went in for this biopsy on July 11 (Alyson's birthday) however his speech and now the ""good side"" of his body was weakened.   This was due to the biopsy.    Again- pure devastation.   While we knew the cancer would eventually impact his movement and speech (due to where the cancer is in his brain..by the motor strips), we were not prepared for this to happen so suddenly nor for it to be because of the biopsy we were assured would have no risk.   This has been one of the hardest parts as a family to watch.     Once this happened, the doctors were unsure if something had happened during the biopsy (stroke, etc) so they took another MRI.   It was not a stroke, etc so the immobility and speech issues were due to the biopsy they did however the MRI showed something we were also not prepared for.     This day was the worst day of all our lives since April of 2016.On July 13th, we were told that the MRI showed the cancer had spread to the other side of his brain.    Not only were we left to deal with this horrible news but we also now had to deal with the immobility on his ""good side"" due to the biopsy they had done.    Jeff had to go back to Kessler Rehab for a few days but we were anxious to get him home immediately because we know time is now precious.     He is now home and we are making him as comfortable as we can given the situation at hand.While the doctors can't give us timing -- and clearly they are very unsure of many things when it comes to this awful disease, we were told if wanted, Jeff could opt for radiation with a mix of immunotherapy.   Jeff was now considered in Stage 4 and the cancer showing up on the MRI was most likely a glioblastoma.   The prognosis of a glioblastoma is not great but we will continue to fight and NEVER give up hope that a miracle may come our way!!!   Our warrior will not give up despite his physical complications either!!     We had a chair lift put into the house to help bring Jeff from downstairs to upstairs and a ramp has been put in on the outside of the house to make it wheelchair accessible when he has to go to radiation (He goes back and forth to the city for radiation through all of this).  Our family has not asked for help up until this point.   While Jeff's story has been out there, we have shielded everyone from all the details- the hard stuff.      While none of us know what tomorrow will bring, this is what we do know.Jeff is now unable to work as his position has been released at this point (he has not been able to work since the clinical trial started in January).  My sister has had to stop working as a Physical Therapist and is now acting as his full time caregiver.     As you can imagine, this has been extremely difficult for her and words will never be able to explain what she is going through.     Due to the fact that she can't work and his position has been released (he carried the benefits), the insurance is no longer covered.   They are offered COBRA to pay on their own for the time being.   Insurance only covers 1 hour of home health care for 12 visits and unfortunately, Jeff now needs more.    My parents, Jeff's parents, and my husband have also been acting as caregivers and helping with the kids but we need more help- everyone has done a tremendous amount so far.  Family and friends have done so much already too and we thank every single one of you but at this time, we are hoping to raise some money for Jeff, Alyson and the kids to help pay for the full time aide we will need (approx. 250 a day), help cover some insurance costs (approx. 1600 a month), installing whatever other equipment is necessary, etc.        Any donation would be MUCH appreciated.  Every single dollar of it will go to help Jeff and the family during this horrible time and anything that is left, will go directly to Alyson to help with the children and home.    Please consider donating to the Leloia family.    It saddens me that this is something we even have to be writing...I have always been the one on the ""other side"" of these pages.   My brother is my HERO.  He is this entire family's hero.  And we will never give up hope.  We will continue to fight this terrible disease until we can't anymore.  We will never stop trying to find a cure so this doesn't happen to any other family.   At 35 years old, no man should ever go through what Jeff is going through and has gone through.  Take a minute today to hug your loved ones and tell them you love them.  In a split second, life for us changed and the scary truth is, it could happen to any of us.  This disease isn't hereditary- it just happens.    Vanessa and Nicholas's lives will never be the same because of it and my sister is watching her best friend and husband fight for his life.     It is unimaginable and absolutely unnatural that this is happening to their young family....We love you Jeff.  Not a day will EVER go by where we don't fight for you and your family and for others who are battling this same disease. Good Vibes Only to our WarriorPam",737,1.9k,31,735,1 month,20 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Pineal gland tumors account for less than 1% of all brain tumors and as a result, determining the appropriate course of action can be both tricky and expensive. The fear and shock from this diagnosis has been overwhelming for Charles, his Mom (Wendy), his younger brother (George) and his older sister (Katherine). Charles now has an incredible team of Doctors at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and is headed there to begin a six month course of chemo treatments next week.If one had to choose the best expression to describe Charles it is that he is a ""Can Do Guy"". Charles has demonstrated this time and time again: on the lacrosse fields at Lake Forest High School, carrying a full course load at De Pauw University, graduating and gaining a spot with IBM consulting and being the chief Cook in the Cook household! When his Dad passed away 12 years ago, Charles stepped up to the plate at 11 years old and became a stronghold for the family. Just before this diagnosis, Charles commented that he was in the best shape of his life: physically, mentally and emotionally. Charles remains determined, focused and deliberate in his dedication to defeating this tumor. In fact, he has said several times that he actually believes that he will be a better person for having gone through this experience. Charles' strength is not a fluke. His Mom, Wendy, is an incredibly strong woman who has dedicated herself to her three children ever since their Dad's sudden death 12 years ago. Like Charles, she would give you the shirt off her back and is incapable of saying no to any request. She is one of the most selfless people I know. Charles' diagnosis has shattered even Wendy's perpetually sunny disposition. It is clear that she is overwhelmed and frightened. If the dictum: You have to be a friend to have a friend has any basis of truth, then Wendy and Charles Cook could jointly run for Mayor of the World! I know that many of his, her, mine, our friends will hear about Charles diagnosis and want to help out. There are numerous uncovered costs that will arise and any donations to help defray those expenses would be incredible and very welcome. Additionally, prayers, positive thoughts and warm wishes are truly appreciated.I will keep all of you updated as Charles conquers this challenge.XOXOTEAM CHARLES",684,1.0k,2,678,3 months,28 days ago,3 months,2018-09-03
Medical,8,Wiley Corra,https://www.gofundme.com/5c6oabc,"DURANGO, CO","March 30, 2018","$85,000","$81,278","Our beautiful boy Wiley is fighting hard for his life and health after a fall and traumatic brain injury which occurred in the most benign of settings. On March 24th, 2018, after a great day of  skiing with friends in Utah,  we went out for a movie. Killing time, waiting for the show to start, we were outside on a pedestrian bridge. There was a low wall on the opposite side that, deceptively, looked to have grass immediately behind. In fact, there was a gap between the grass and bridge that dropped 25 feet to a service road below. Excited and energetic, Wiley lept onto the wall, looking back at us, and dropped to the other side expecting a short and soft landing on grass, as we expected too. Hearing a delayed hit from below, we knew this wasn’t the case.  

Frantically, I searched for a way down. When I got to my  boy I was sure he was lost to us. I now know that grief. Within five minutes the ambulance was there; ten more and he was at Intermountain Hospital, Level I Trauma Center in Murray, UT.  Dr Peter Maughan performed a decompressive craniectomy (removal of a section of skull to allow the brain to swell). There is significant damage to his left brain. Other various fractures and breaks are not of concern, his spine is okay, and bruised lungs will heal. He is fighting hard. 

Wiley has always been a determined young man. He is an excellent, Freshman Honor Roll Student at Durango High School. He is sweet, loving and caring toward his friends, family, and teammates, never in serious trouble, focused and attentive (when we pry his nose out of video devices). He has a long and arduous road ahead toward recovery. While he is as well prepared for this journey as anyone could be, the outcome is uncertain.  The care at IMH is outstanding. Given the circumstances we couldn’t be in a better place. 

We so appreciate your taking an interest in Wiley’s recovery. The love and support that has been flowing from our home community, Durango (and well beyond) is staggering.  As hard as this is-and it is the hardest thing we have ever endured- it would be unimaginable without your love, prayers, and positive thoughts for Wiley’s recovery. You are helping  us become the warriors needed to fight alongside our precious boy. Thank you.",639,1.4k,11,646,5 months,3 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Those of you who know Sofia know how much she loves her family and her friends. One of her favorite things to do is spend time with her cousins. She also loves singing, acting and cheerleading. Sofia is currently in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. She suffered a severe head trauma and is still in critical condition. Sofia has a long recovery ahead of her, but she is resilient and a fighter. My parents have not left her side and will need to continue to be by her side as we face the long and challenging road that lies ahead of her. I want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out, kept Sofia and our family in their prayers and sent food. Many of you have asked what else you can do to help. As my parents will need to continue to be by her side any donations for my family are greatly appreciated and will help with expenses. We know Sofia is a strong girl and will find the power within to fight her way through this. Please continue to pray for my sister and our family, and for all the other families impacted by this senseless event. Thank you.",1.0k,5.9k,5,970,3 months,1 month ago,3 months,2018-09-03

Complications of her diabetes left her without enough oxygen for a number of hours which in turn caused significant trauma to her brain. While the prognosis is not good, we all believe that there is room for hope and that the Jackie we know, the one that has been battling diabetes for years while managing to make a wonderful life and career for herself, will continue to fight. The Habeebs are extremely grateful to all that have gone to visit, reached out, offered help, and prayed for Jackie. With that said, I would ask that we offer our financial assistance as well. As of today, the plan is to bring  Jackie up from Charleston back home to Boston where she will have the best care and be close to friends and family. The process of moving her via med flight is not covered by insurance and is in excess of $13,000 and while insurance will cover a lot of the actual costs associated with the medical care, there is still a significant portion that the Habeebs themselves will incur. There isn’t a person that has met the Habeebs that hasn’t been touched by their selfless generosity. There is always a chair at the table for another guest, another bed for those in need, and a happy home for a wondering soul. When my sister in law was pregnant, they hosted her baby shower. When my brother passed away, they held the celebration of his life there. And when my wedding came to an end, it was the Habbebs that invited all guests for a nightcap. While I may have benefited more than most, I’m sure each of you has a fond memory of a holiday spent in their kitchen, a Patriots game in their family room,  or a sweltering summer's day spent in their pool. As the Habeebs often say, we are all cousins. It’s time we come together and support the family that made all of us family. This is going to be an uphill battle but with your support and prayers I have no doubt that Jackie can do it. Please contribute what you can.-Please note that this fund has been approved by the Habeeb family and is much appreciated",641,2.0k,64,643,1 month,28 days ago,1 month,2018-09-03

Medical,9,Assist Sally Newman,https://www.gofundme.com/assist-sally-newman,"BROOKLYN, NY","April 19, 2018","$100,000","$77,285","Hi Friends, We are raising money to help our friend Sally Newman, who is fighting osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer.  Sally was one of the maids of honor at our wedding and a friend for more than 10 years.  She is an amazing person and friend, and she brings light into the lives of everyone she meets. Sally is also an amazing lawyer and advocate, who has done so much for so many people. Sally graduated from NYU law in 2009 and she is the founder of  Charleston Legal Access, a nonprofit sliding-scale law firm meant to help people gain access to legal services.  It is a wonderful endeavor, but obviously not a very profitable one. Beyond her illness, Sally and her husband Romain are facing high medical costs and she is unable to work. We want to help her to have more comfort during this fight.  Please help support Sally during this challenging time in her life.  Thank you, Kimberly Ong & Ian Marcus AmelkinPS--Here is an amazing letter that Sally recently posted on her prognosis and how she is handling it: Off Course — An Update on How Cancer Hijacked my 2018 Dear everyone — this is dedicated to everyone who I’ve been unresponsive to in the past few months, or not responsive enough. When I was going through the diagnosis process and the research and treatment consultations, I was too overwhelmed to communicate much; now, in chemotherapy, I’m so fatigued that I feel further away than ever from catching up. Please know that if I haven’t responded it’s not for lack of loving you with all my heart. Even if we haven’t talked much lately.This is also dedicated to everyone who I don’t know well who might be reading this. I’ve spent hours and hours reading up on cancer and cancer treatment and surgeries and have a new, profound appreciation for everyone who has been willing to share intimate details of their struggles so people like me can find encouragement and hope in their stories. I’ve been quiet on social media the last few months but am making this public because who knows — if I can pay it forward and this is helpful to someone, a shade less privacy is worth it.The bad newsAs you might have heard, for the last year I’ve had a mystery ailment in my left glute. Actually, I first noticed my left side looked a little different from my right side about four years ago, but one year ago, I noticed my left leg seemed longer than my right, and I started getting lower back pain and tightness and swelling in my glute. I started visiting a long list of professionals, including an orthopedic surgeon, who seemed unconcerned, and acupuncturists and massage therapists, who were stumped. Finally, this fall, I found a primary care physician (he thought maybe my right side was atrophied) and insisted he refer me for an MRI, which showed one fist-sized solid mass in my soft tissue, surrounded by an ominous looking network of — something — infiltrating the muscles around the mass. The orthopedic oncologist I was referred to diagnosed it as something called tumoral calcinosis, which is a rare disease associated with mineralization. To make a long story short, he was wrong, and luckily his and his team’s incompetence was evident enough, early enough, that I knew something was off and went for a second opinion less than a month later at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. Within two days, they had diagnosed me with osteosarcoma based on complete imaging (the MRI I got in Charleston was “not very good” — burn — according to the Mayo doctors, which is to say that they didn’t bother imaging my whole pelvis and missed the important part that showed it was CANCER). It sucks that I didn’t catch this earlier. On the other hand, let’s all thank the baby Jesus, Buddha, mother Earth and everyone who encouraged me to be pushy and pursue that second opinion (edited to add: to the tune of $17K, which my insurance denied, and denied on appeal, and I put on credit cards. In case anyone has forgotten how truly shitty our healthcare system is).Anyway. This is where I frequently get stuck in imagining breaking this news to people, because there is cancer and then there is cancer, and after a cancer diagnosis, the natural followup question is what the prognosis is. There are cancers where 99% of people survive with the right minor surgery, and there are cancers where…. Well, where a lot of people don’t survive. And the truth is, I have a profoundly shitty kind of cancer. Osteosarcoma (which is extraordinarily rare in adults) is generally acknowledged to be treatable only by chemo (a few months), followed by surgery, followed by chemo (more months to a year or more, depending on how well it works). Oh, and the surgery that was first offered to me is something charmingly called a “hindquarter amputation” — and if that wasn’t bad enough, a few days later the offer was rescinded (by those doctors) because my cancer is too advanced to amputate my hindquarter. Yeah. This was obviously a lot to take in. As for prognosis, earlier in the century, overall survival rates were 20%. Now that chemo exists, it’s more like 60–70%… unless you have metastases at diagnosis, which I do. My rate is more like 20%. Except that right now I’m not eligible for surgery, which puts me, statistically, at a five year survival rate of — well, generously, 10%. Except! Except! As I’ll discuss at some point, I have a badass immune system (this has been scientifically measured), which puts me at… higher? I don’t know. Listen, this cancer is bad. There are treatments. I’m going to do my best to help them work. None of us are guaranteed a certain amount of time on earth. Probably this is the thing that will kill me. But I’m trying to survive. And one thing that the research shows is that having a loving support network helps cancer patients thrive, and I am being absolutely lavished with love and support. Believe it or not, one of the hardest struggles of this process (and therefore of my life) has been feeling worthy of the care I’m receiving. That is true.If you’re feeling down after that prognosis, which, I don’t know, hopefully you are? Let’s pause here to check in with my all time FAVORITE cancer author, Kate Bowler. Buy her book! I might be biased by the fact that it was published right when I desperately needed to hear from a thoughtful, funny, insightful 38 year old woman who also was told recently she had incurable cancer and yet is living a meaningful life and has made sense of things, but it’s very, very good, and every page resonated with me. Her NYTimes article, What to Say When You Meet the Angel of Death at a Party, which first made me aware of her genius, is also excellent, and, get this, one of her podcast episodes features the best Washington Post writer, Alexandra Petri, who she is friends with. A ton of people have asked if there is anything they can do for me, and mostly I ask for smoothies and cat gifs (and occasionally money), but darlings, what I really want is to be friends with Kate Bowler (and Alexandra Petri). If you could hook that up that would be amazing.What it’s like (? Sometimes? For me) getting diagnosed with cancerOne thing about hearing that my life expectancy is somewhere in the months or years instead of decades, and that I’ll spend — some, most or all of that life in chemotherapy, is that all of these everyday objects and concepts feel like they’re whirling off into space, having come unmoored from my expectations and implied plans. Here are a few things that upon crossing my mind have sent me into the depths of despair in the last few months: hairties, a dental checkup, my mortgage, retinol creams, Latisse, Lasix, my disorganized garage, continuing legal education credits, houseplants, my solar panels, kittens, videos of circus performances…It’s like living in a horror movie where I look at my hiking shoes and they’re like “LIFE IS FUTILE, SHORT, AND PAINFUL” and I start sobbing. It’s honestly extremely disorienting. But thankfully, after four months, I’m getting used to the new reality and regaining my sense of humor. The irony of living out what might be my last year or two waiting to get used to the idea of dying is not lost on me, by the way.In general my cancer diagnosis doesn’t seem very personal. My pain is mingled in the pain it has caused and will cause my husband, my father, my sister, and dear friends, family and colleagues, and while everyone suffers in different ways we are in it together, which is both uplifting and crushingly sad. But this constant barrage of cancer reminders feels much more personal, and so that much more isolating and frightening.I’m also embarrassed to say that one of the overwhelming emotions I felt upon diagnosis was… well, embarrassment. Imagine that through no fault of your own, your car was run off the road during rush hour, and you were stuck in a ditch while everyone rubbernecked on their way home from dinner. This is more or less how I felt — humiliated, off course, and certain that I would be on display for everyone’s even more embarrassing sympathy. Except, times a million because it’s not my car, it’s my life. I hate sympathy! I mean, I like love and attention, like everyone, but I hate the idea of being a tragedy being tsked over.Which is why I felt a soft sense of comradery and fellowship when I learned that a Dartmouth classmate of mine, Ali Youssefi, died recently of cancer. Ali and I were in the same freshman orientation hiking group, and became kinda-friends because we were also assigned to the same freshman dorm. I think my husband and Ali’s wife will forgive me for mentioning that I had a huuuuuge crush on Ali. His family is from Iran, and he had lovely brown eyes and a dashing smile. Dimples? I think so. At the time, our political views, which were the only thing that was really important to me, diverged to an extent that shocked me, although I’ve probably mellowed a bit with him, and more recently he’s reposted some Bernie Sanders quotes (and found a career as a developer who brought affordable housing projects to his hometown of Sacramento — so wonderful), so we might have come around in our middle age. Just a few weeks ago, he did a facebook fundraiser for Palestinian children for his birthday, and I donated, and he messaged me to say thank you. Drowning in my own recent diagnosis, I didn’t respond, but I wish I had, or that I’d looked at his profile, and realized he was in the midst of his own illness, about to start another round of chemotherapy for stomach cancer. Diagnosed in July, he was gone eight months later. I’m so sorry for his loss. But a part of me reached out to him and felt less alone. Me too, said a part of me. I’m dying too. We’re friends in this.And now…I’ll add at least one more entry on Medium later to talk about treatment, but the short story is that I’m currently in NYC being treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I’ve made it through two months of a protocol that’s known for being brutal — a three week cycle of high dose cisplatin and doxorubicin — and I’m doing OK. Not to spoil the hopefully good news of future updates, where I’ll talk a little more specifically about what my doctors are doing and what the rest of the protocol might be, but it looks like my cancer is responding to the chemo for now. It also looks like the remainder of 2018 will be spent in treatment, although there’s not a clear course charted, which if you know me of course you know is driving me insane. As Kate Bowler says, it feels like walking toward a cliff and trusting a bridge will be built over it when I get there. But I’m putting one foot in front of the other, and people who love me are holding my hands.",438,415,3,448,4 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

In January 2017, Michele was diagnosed with Stage IV Adrenal Cancer which has spread to her liver and lungs. She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and has undergone many surgeries. Michele’s cancer is unusual as it is a very rare and aggressive form that many doctors have not seen. However, this cancer can find just about anyone and change the course of their life as it has theirs. She has endured many painful rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and has undergone many surgeries. Despite the side effects associate with these treatments, Michele continues doing what she does best, sharing hope and love to humans and canines. She smiles, even when it’s difficult, she lends an ear to those she loves even when she needs to be heard, she works diligently to care for dogs in need. Always putting others first. Michele’s kindness holds no boundries and her love is unconditional.  At this stage in her journey, Michele’s oncologist recommends that she undergo yet another treatment called Cryoablation. This time insurance has denied this treatment and her oncologist believes it could help her tremendously. He has been 100% dedicated to her recovery and she trusts him 1000%. Michele is suiting up for battle once again! While chemotherapy and radiation have been undeniably tough, she has the same positive attitude, strength, and determination to beat this disease, a feat equally as inspiring. Michele needs your help! During this time, friends and family have been sitting on the sidelines, asking what they can do to help. The Magnano’s have appreciated all of the love and support that friends and family have given and weathered the financial responsibilities on their own. Now, there is an opportunity for us to step off of the sidelines and help them help Michele. The time has come when they need it most. All they really needed were your thoughts, prayers and love, until now.  Anyone who knows Michele, Joe and their family of humans and canines, already know that if the roles were reversed, they are always the first ones to lend a helping hand. No situation prevents them from coming to the aide of someone, even during the toughest battle of their lives. Even though they do so unconditionally and without expectation, now is the time that we can help and be a part of Michele’s fight to beat this dreaded disease. Beating this rare disease would be amazing for Michele and to give hope to others who share her battle.  Every little bit will help them to raise the money they need to cover these medical expenses.

The treatment seemed to  be effective in getting her body to reboot with Doctors hoping that her Kidneys and Liver would begin to heal themselves.  After three weeks at Mount Sinai, they released her back home and while she was determined to be home for mothers day, she quickly developed a fever and we immediately had to bring her back to Overlook again.  Unfortunately, due to the seriousness of the condition, this time they had to transfer Maggie to Columbia Presbyterian in NYC where it has been determined she will need a full liver transplant.Like most who have to deal with a crisis, we never imagined being in this position and certainly weren’t prepared financially for what was to come.  We don’t live in a grand house, we don’t take elaborate vacations and we spend most time trying to find a way to make ends-meet to cover basic expenses.  Sadly, this has totally exhausted all of our resources.   Not only are the medical procedures coming with profound expenses that aren’t covered by insurance, but also the sad fact that Maggie has no paid time off due to the fact that she just started a new job at the Westfield Public Schools this year.  In the effort to pay the mounting medical bills, after care for the kids amongst other things, we are getting to a point where we have exhausted all of our reserves and need help financially. While certainly a humbling experience, please help. LoveThe Grabko's",667,1.4k,10,673,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03

While serving overseas, Jack suffered a gunshot wound to the head and immediately received medical treatment by the US military.  Jack was stabilized overseas and transported to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) where he started the healing process.  He spent 39 days at WRNMMC before being transferred to Massachusetts to start his recovery.During his military career, Jack took part in every major conflict that the United States has been involved in since the early 90’s. If you know Jack, he kept a private life. If you had the honor to serve with Jack, you know his actions in combat were heroic. Jack and his wife have three beautiful children; his oldest daughter recently graduated from college and his younger daughter is currently a full-time college student. His five-year-old son is very energetic and truly a chip off the “ol’ Souza block”.  Upon arrival at WRNMMC, Team Souza (Jack’s wife and kids) in typical military family fashion established a 24hr (three 8-hour shifts) bedside vigil so he would never be alone in his time of need.  Now that Jack is out of ICU and on the road to recovery, “Team Souza” has incorporated the newest team member, Jack’s five-year-old son, into the fold, and he is enjoying much missed quality time with his dad during recovery. Jack is not only an incredible parent to his three children, but also to the kids of his close friends who have deployed in the past, as many of these children consider him a father figure and refer to him as “Uncle Jack.”Jack is making impressive progress every day and everyone who knows Jack knows he will make a full recovery- it’s just going to take time and lots of effort.Jack’s friends request this GoFundMe site be established to assist Team Souza through this challenging time and to help with future unanticipated costs of recovery.  Thanks so much for your loving support for Jack and his family during his recovery.",246,1.2k,5,237,2 months,1 month ago,-1,2018-09-03
Medical,9,Help Robin Recover,https://www.gofundme.com/help-robin-recover,"ORADELL, NJ","April 1, 2018","$50,000","$73,156","#HelpRobinRecover Hi my name is Scott Salem and the purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for my wife Robin, and mother of Matthew, to help her continuing battle against multiple cancers.BackstoryIn early 2013 Robin found a lump under her arm and after a few tests was diagnosed with two types of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. A course of chemotherapy called R-CHOP was prescribed and treatment began. The treatment consisted of one 6-hour infusion every three weeks for a total of 18 weeks. Halfway through the chemo a routine scan was performed to determine the status of the Lymphoma. The scan showed that the Lymphoma was in remission, but it was also discovered that she had Colon cancer as well.The Next Step In the summer of 2013 it was determined that Robin required surgery to remove the tumor in her colon and had to pause the chemotherapy for the surgery. The surgeon had to remove her cecum, appendix, and 16 inches of her bowel and she came through it with flying colors. The doctors told us that the cancer was fully removed and to resume the chemotherapy, but in her weakened condition Robin developed an infection to the surgery site and had to undergo wound therapy. Finally, late in the year she was able to complete the Lymphoma treatment with relatively mild side effects such as weakness and hair loss.RemissionIn early 2014 we got great news, the follow-up tests showed the Lymphoma in remission and no signs of the colon cancer and Robin was put on a maintenance chemo drug called Rituxan to help keep the Lymphoma in remission. The oncologist determined that no other treatment for the colon cancer was required, the rest of the year went well as she got stronger and was able to be taken off all treatment.Our Worst NightmareIn the beginning of 2015 after routine follow-up tests it was found that the colon cancer had returned. Wow, hearing that news was like being hit by a Mack truck. Robin was determined to beat it so after another surgery to remove a few more inches of her colon, another course of chemo was recommended. This was named FULFOX which consisted of 12 infusions, one every other week, and each time she was sent home with a pump to continue medication for 48 hours longer. Unlike the previous chemo the side effects this time were brutal. Robin was hospitalized a few times and had to pause the treatment to regain some strength. Finally, near the end of 2015 she resumed the treatment.The Battle Had Just BegunThen out of nowhere she started losing her balance, kept falling, and her arms and legs got numb. The oncologist described it as temporary neuropathy caused by the chemotherapy. We were shocked because we had no idea that this was a possible side effect. Robin went on and finished her treatment but her temporary neuropathy turned out to be permanent. She has been mostly bed ridden for the past 2 years. The Fight ContinuesRobin is a fighter, and has vowed to keep going, at the end of last year the cancers remained in remission, then very recently it was discovered that her Lymphoma has returned, we are still deciding on the course of treatment because Robin will never give up. Please Help Robin RecoverWhile our insurance covered most of the expenses we had to hire private nurse/aide to care for her while I was at work, which is not covered. We have drained our savings and have gone into considerable debt to cover the related expenses that are not covered. In addition to the private care that is required there are other non-covered expenses, such as certain medical equipment and modifying our home to make it handicapped friendly. The last 5 years have taken a toll both physically and mentally on the whole family. We ask you to please donate whatever you can, $1, $5, $10, any amount will help Robin continue her fight against this devastating disease. We will keep you updated on her condition and I know with your generosity she will be a cancer survivor.

The doctor perscribed him antibiotics thinking it was pneumonia.  Once he finished the treatment he still did not feel well and went back to the doctor.  In early December,  the doctor ordered a CAT scan which came back abnormal.  A week later Eric and his wife Jessica flew down to Seattle to see an oncologist at Sweedish medical center. The first day Eric had fluid drainned that had been building up around his right lung.  The following day he had a PET scan and a MRI  to help doctors better understand what might be going on.  On December 12, 2017  Eric and Jessica were given a heartbreaking diagnosis.  Eric had stage 4 non small cell lung cancer.   He is not a smoker, nor has he ever been.    At that time the doctor went over his treatment plan:  4-6 rounds of chemotherapy.  He will be having his 4th treatment tomorrow, March 8th.  As you can imagine there have been many expenses-  not all covered by insurance. There have been good days and bad days, multiple trips to Seattle, a stay at the hospital here in Sitka, medical supplies, missed work, costs for hotels, and more to come.  The bills are not far behind. If we could all come together as friends, family and community to  help lift a piece of this burden off of their shoulders, then there will be a sliver of sunshine in their darkest hour. Prayers are answered.  Please pray for Eric and his family.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.",116,534,0,118,5 months,26 days ago,-1,2018-09-03

Medical,10,Help fund  treatment for Jawad,https://www.gofundme.com/help-fund-treatment-for-jawad,"IRVING, TX","July 7, 2018","$50,000","$70,141","My name is Summar Hussein and I, with a heavy heart am creating this page in hopes of helping my sweet 6 year old nephew Jawad. Jawad is a bright, energetic, witty and  intelligent boy. He’s the light of our family and is loved by everyone he meets. You can always find him either reading or playing sports, and he is a die hard Boston Red Sox fan! Jawad loves spending time at the library and playing with his 3 older siblings. Since the day he was born, one of Jawad’s most admired physical traits were his eyes. Everyone who knows him will attest to this. Ironically enough, he is being tested with that same vital organ. About 2 months ago, my sister Nancy Hussein noticed that he was not making proper eye contact, he wasn't focusing properly.  She scheduled him for an eye exam but appointments were so far out. As the days passed he was no longer interested in going to the library to read, or picking up a book before bed to read with his mom. He mentioned a few times that everything was black.  His overall activity decreased. He was never one to miss a chance of being outdoors but he was showing more and more disinterest in everything he loved doing. The day of his eye exam finally came and he went in with high spirits and good hopes. Immediately upon exam, his right eye had no activity. It was not responding to light or movement. He was completely blind in his right eye.  Further examination by ultrasound showed white spots covering his retina. This was enough to have him scheduled for an emergent sedated MRI. Before being put to sleep for his exam, he told his mom that he was excited because this would be the best nap ever! And that when he wakes up he can’t wait to give her a big hug. On July 3, 2018 Jawad was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.  This is a rare form of cancer that affects young children. About 300 children in America are diagnosed with Retinoblastoma each year.  It can be caused by a rare genetic or congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene. The MRI showed several seed-like tumors starting around his optic nerve and around his retina. With the location of these tumors being so critical, it is impossible to remove them and restore his vision.  Retinoblastoma has a high curability rate but only after the child loses the affected eye. This is done to remove the cancer with hopes that it does not spread to any other parts of his body. His treatment plan will begin with targeted intra-arterial melphalan chemotherapy. This will be targeted to his right eye and will be done for 3 months. This will be done to reduce the size of the tumors to make his surgery easier. Since this intra -arterial treatment is not offered in Texas where he resides, he will be traveling to Philadelphia to receive the treatment.The next step will be the Enucleation which is the removal of the eye. After that he will be fitted with a prosthetic eye which will need to be changed every so often has he grows. We are hopeful that Jawad can be treated completely and become cancer free as soon as possible. Knowing that, being able to provide him with the best treatment available for him will put an intense amount of financial strain on our family.In Arabic, Jawad means “Generous”. We are kindly asking you to honor his name and open up your hearts to Jawad and donate generously. All funds will go towards treatment that isn’t even partially covered by insurance and to allow his father to take time off work to accompany Jawad to  his appointments and provide the support he needs on this difficult journey. Donations will also be used to help cover travel expenses for the time spent in Philadelphia receiving chemotherapy. Even the smallest amount will make a difference. Most importantly, we ask for your sincere prayers for his fast healing and that God makes this journey light on him and his family.

Everything was fine until he decided to go to hospital one day to get his breathing problem checked. Upon meeting the doctors in Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, he was told that it might have something to do with his kidneys not functioning properly and upon tests, found out that he was suffering from chronic tuburointerstitial nephritis. The differential diagnosis also included sarcoidosis and tuburointerstitial nephritis with uveitis syndrome (TINU) and idiopathic forms of TIN. In simple terms his kidneys failed and they have to be replaced.He has insurance coverage in USA but still had to pay around $10,000 expenses for different payments in the hospital. His current condition is that he needs dialysis for every 2 days till his kidneys are transplanted. He wants to go to India as his family members are willing to donate kidney for him. It will cost $4000 to take him to India along with assistance. Surgery in India would cost him $12900 in Yashoda hospitals, Hyderabad. ICU charges would be $1400 per day. He would need to go through dialysis for 3 months which would cost him around $5000 for 90 days. Apart from all these expenses, Ravi still has the burden of his humongous master’s student loan on him. All of us know how difficult it is for a fresh graduate out of the college to manage such huge expenses.
